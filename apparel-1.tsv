GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS	1
I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product	0
These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool..	1
I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off	0
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right	1
I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.	0
Very nice basic clothing.  I think the size is fine.  I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color.  This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens	1
A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.	0
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :	1
Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice	0
Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!	1
THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone	0
Your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks!  I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered	1
I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.	0
very portable. great picture. easy to operate. all the accessories you need. great sound. playes dvd's from sony camcorder. very happy with the system. am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation.	1
Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small	0
I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.
the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company	0

IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it	0
I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!
I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!


These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).
Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 


Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen.	1
Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......	0
The quality is much better than expected. I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept. 6, 2005. We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities, our cell phones, travelers checks, keys, and medicines in particular. We love the spacious divided compartments. I highly reccommend this product..	1
These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money. 
Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say	1
	0
The shirts are what I had asked for.  They are sturdy and well made.  I would buy more if I needed more.  Well worth the money spen	1
Nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ?
I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock	1
It looks good but is it 4"X 8"  or  12" X 8" ?   Sure would be nice to know the size before I buy.............
I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag.  I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit.  Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected	1

It's golden color is very remarkable ..It looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have	1
I bought two of these bags so far. both have failed at the plastic fastener, one arm just snapped in no time. the bag itself is ok, but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap... I wont buy a third one.	0
  With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years	1
I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied	1

The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand	0
The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly	1
The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose	0
Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all	1
Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers.  Relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open  nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all	1
The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER	0
These are some really good glasses.  Plenty dark, full mirrored so you won't be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by.  Shoot, for $18 you can't go wrong.  I highly recommend them.  And since I'm a pilot, it was obvious that I got a pair of these	1
THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone	0
I found these at Lane Bryant and I absolutely love them! I wear them under my work clothes every day. You've got to try them	1

About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS	1
Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small	0
I got this handbag for my 14th birthday and I looove it so much!!It is so perfect, the best chanel handbag there is. Everyone that saw my new handbag loved it and asked where I bought. I actually bought it at nordstrom. Everyone should have one!!BUY IT	1
the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company	0
I can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said. I have 1 of the 41" for summer and now 2 of the 50" for fall and winter. The colors remain solid after mutiple washes, and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend! ngmackie, Dunwoody, GA	1
If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. 
must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers. i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems. very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation.  very good looking comfortable shoes .  only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support --these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer-- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them	1

My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels. So, I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it! And I quote "It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference (re: comfort) for those long international flights." Big hit! 
The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through	0

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon.

I bought this scarf with a gift certificate I received for Christmas.  I love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own.  It is super-warm and retains it shape, even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress	1

I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.


Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 
Other than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received	1

Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place	1
Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......	0
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve	1

Awesome shoes. Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless. I'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously, and who likes to look even cooler when doing it.	1

This is a top quality item. I is an 80%/20% cotton/poly mix-double stitched seams...very well made. I bought a 2X for my son who ususally wears a 3X, and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice, it's just as perfect as the day it was delivered.	1
Nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ?
These shoes are awesome, I have bowled with them for the past couple of weeks and they are just what I was looking for. The color is hot and everyone on my league noticed them and said very positive things about them. Thanks for the super fast shipping and supurb quailty	1
It looks good but is it 4"X 8"  or  12" X 8" ?   Sure would be nice to know the size before I buy.............
My husband loves this coat. He wears it all winter. If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it. He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect. Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable. THis is the second one he has purchased.	1

I have been using this for awhile now.  Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive, it's a lighter weight material/construction.  I wouldn't say that there probably isn't something better out there and it isn't cheap - but it's not bad.  For my peers that have this 'issue', you know what I'm talking about!:	1
I bought two of these bags so far. both have failed at the plastic fastener, one arm just snapped in no time. the bag itself is ok, but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap... I wont buy a third one.	0
Before this bra, I would have to wear an underwire bra, and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce. My cup size is F, so it's been difficult to find a sports bra that I can wear standalone. 
The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose	0

Well folks, I found it. THIS IS THE BRA!! I wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was AMAZING! It did better than the two bra combination ever did. If you're looking for a sports bra that actually WORKS, this is the one	1

I got the flip flops for my granddaughter for christmas she wore her  cheap ones out from wal-mart and her mother told her white is summer only and no one could find white ones right now I told her I bet her I could and so I did and she loves them and so did all her friends at school. we know it is winter but so far in indiana it is not bad so you can wear flip flops and tanks for now. thank you for  the great gift.	1
The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.

This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow.	1
I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free	0
I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.
I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.
The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.

The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. 
Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin. 
As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.

I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms	1
Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.
I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.


But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??	0
After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's "customs broker" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.
I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.	0

A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.	0
I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.
Very cute, I always get compliments, but I wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up - you'd think I wear them everyday!  I'm just upset I paid over $60 for shoes that will BARELY last one season	0

I purchased these about 3 months ago.  They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere.  I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home.  They are already ripping in the back.  
The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. 
I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are. 	0

I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again	0
The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.
I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy	0

The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist	0
The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.
I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all	0

I usually wear size 7M. However, This shoe of size 7M is way too small. I have to return it to AMAZON and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself. I will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	0
Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit	1
Haven't worn it yet to test the quality however, the structure is all wrong. One leg is more narrow than than the other (I could barely fit my leg into it) and the waist is really high	0
The sheets were just as described and worth the price. Timely on shippng also. Very pleased	1
Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong.  Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response	0
The Crib sheets were soft, the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress	1
I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.  I highly recommend it to those who don't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress	1
Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month	0
Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced	1
I received the trousers in a timely manner.  They were what i expected although they did not fit.  I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company. 	0
Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things, and they are working great!  Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected! Thanks!	1
This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.
I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance.

It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price.
Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for.
(By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)	1

The shoes are better then expected.. Everyone comments on how nice they are and where did you get them.. I will let anyone know to buy the	1
Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes	0
I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.
Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company. While we were happy with the quality, our order was missing 2 shirts. Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know, but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. If you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company	0

I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this	0
This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)
This was a nightmare order.I paid extra for expedited shipping to assure Christmas arrival.Package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until AFTER Christmas -Disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift didn't make it.The shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.They are also impossible to reach-Amazon couldn't even get them on phone.Thank goodness the shoes fit-I can't begin to imagine what a return would have been like. The product is great	0

These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes.  The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact.  I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.
Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.


They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them.  I returned them and plan to try something else	0
I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.
I ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of December and never received the item. I am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me. If people can't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out. Two thumbs down	0

BEWARE..............This is a "little" girls camisole, and CHEAP looking	0
For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money	1
Look closely at the picture of the "white" top.  It actually has red around the top and on the straps.  To those of us who don't want ugly red zig-zag thread.......	0
I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience	1
Shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel.  I love Clark's, but not this pair	0
Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.	1
I got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38DDD chest.  Think again.  Go for the the ENELL sports bra.  I bought a size 3 and it is perfect.  No bounce whatsoever!!!  I was amazed.... don't bother with this one	0
I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.
I am a 38 FF, and I was hoping this would help hold me in while running - NOT! This bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price! I'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in! This one is going back	0

This shirt was larger than I expected.  I got a 2x because i'm a 12-14, but it was way too big.  Also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured	0
As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing	1
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN	0
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.	1
I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of
I have used this mat almost everytime I've been outdoors.  I haven't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques.  It is an awesome value for the price.  	1

THEY CALL THEIR SOCKS THE "WORLDS SOFTEST MEN'S CLASSIC CREW SOCK" AND LET ME TELL YOU ITS THE TRUTH. BEEN LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF RED SOCKS FOR WEEKS, WITH OUT SUCCESS. THEY MAY NOT BE THE SHADE OF RED I WANTED BUT THEY ARE THE BEST IN FIT AND QUALITY. NOW FIND ME THE "RED SHADE" I'M LOOKING FOR AND I'LL BE EVEN MORE PLEASED.
The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear	0

I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.  
          Norb Reynders.......yes over 13... going on 7	1

Nice, soft leatherette. The inside is roomy, and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio. The tie-front detail stays so, you don't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening. Nice silver buckle accents on strap. Great	1
I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund.  I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product	0
I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. I was not disappointed! The bag is large and roomy, made of heavy-duty material, with outside pocket, and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys, etc. for easy finding.  It will make the perfect beach bag for us, and could be used for almost anything.  	1
The sizes listed do not print on the invoice.  Instead, Army Navy uses 'codes.'  When they send the wrong sizes, then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15% restocking fee plus return shipping	0
These are great girl socks! Besides being economical, they feel good, wash good, are very stylish, and don't fall down! They look great with jeans and khakis. I have ordered several more pairs, in different colors. A true value	1
Quality was terrible, undersized or seconds. Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price.
The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. The leather is very soft also. Even though the toe is very pointed, these boots are still comfortable. Amazon has a great price on these boots	1

Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent.	1
I would not recommend these to anyone
I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price, I got them. When she opened them, she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says "no difference"	1
I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product	0
I was very pleased with the socks.  They were just what we were looking for!  Thanks so much	1
The shoes weren't the color that I wanted them to be. To me, there cheap and are over priced! The quality is not good. They can easily be scuffed. Am definitely returning them!!	0
I purchased this bra on a special for 6.50. Well worth that price. i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price. very comfortable and great fit----great everyday bra for larger chests (I am a 38D	1
...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called "Hollywood Heelz," I should have known better.
i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily, sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here, after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems, it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold, which is a gorgeous pale lame, and am currently lusting over the black :	1
I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone	0
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too	1
These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? 	0
As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present "one size fits all,"it becomes increasingly difficult
The material's good, but the suit runs way too small.  I ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements, but all my wobbly bits are poking out.  I don't think I could wear this out in public!  Not for curvy women!	0
for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in
I never received this item when I was promised it, so it was cancelled and my account was credited	0
anything other than the most expensive brands. These shoes
Not the best fabric, Scratchy and See thru. You get what you pay for on these	0
are well made and an excellent value. The only negative
I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were "sheepskin". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not "curly and fluffy" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me " they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless.
is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer
What happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund. Nice	0
to make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit in

This is an outstanding shoe!  It has good support, looks great and cleans easily.  The price is comparable to any good quality, kids', athletic shoe.  An excellent choice for an active athlete who hasn't yet grown into adult sizes.  	1

i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items	1
I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!
it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length.  ya who.

Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will	0
I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.	1
I actually had to send this back cause of the size.  They run really small. 	0
The slippers are great!  They do seem to be on the large side of a 15.  My husband had to put paper in the toes.  He wears 15 in every thing else	1
These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..	0
I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit.  My little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! Thanks so much !	1
Very poor quality, falling apart at the seams. Also really long.	0
Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl	1
These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!  	0
One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn.  I own several, and they're just about all I'll wear!  Very nice fit, and good look under clothes	1
If you see the description: made in Italy, be careful! They are made in India. I have written to amazon to let them change. But if you still see made in Italy, be careful! Everybody knows the difference	0
I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too "young" feeling, just right.	1
this adapter nearly caught fire the first time I used it. watch out	0
I got this jacket last week, I liked it for the price i paid	1
So cheap, the seams weren't sewn up all the way.  Am returning	0
Single Style, good shoes. I think is a nice choice to every day work	1
The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash	1
THIS HAS BEEN THE COMPLAINT OF OTHERS I SEE, BUT THERE IS NO SIZING INFORMATION FOR THIS PRODUCT AND CONSEQUENTLY I CANNOT PURCHASE AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING	0
My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted	1
Get EE if you get these.  The D is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	0
Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up	1
The tie does have gorgeous color to it, but when the description says "good quality" its a little off base. 	0
I LOVE these shoes...I have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. I also love the price	1
It didn't meet my expectations.....It was flimsy and wrinkled, and looked messy	0
It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.  
I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it. This clock is a piece of trash.  I never could set it correctly. Each time  I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode. The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed.  Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set.
I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it.	1
If you buy this clock you will regret it	0
The fit is great. Sexy slim look and feel. Slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim. Got lots of compliments	1
I ordered two bras and both were defective. The left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing	0
the price for the slippers was average- no big discount, but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas. That was a big plus. And my daughter loved them	1
I have returned the shirt from amazon/macys. I did not like it and I am still waiting for my refund. I purchased it in January. Where's my refund. I will not buy from companies that don't offer free shipping. I was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back.
Very cute tops, for a nice price.  They wash up good.  They do run a little big, just so you are aware	1

The beading on the bag is fantastic, and its very cute.  The color is even more exquisite in person.  It's just big enough to hold ID, a little money, and a lipstick, perfect for going out at night	1

my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present	1
Beware, this item is NOT a zip front hoodie as the item description says. It is a pullover!	0
They are perfect for kids daily lunches.  Would like to order more but don't where to start. Lost all the ordering information	1
The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16	0
i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20" nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it.  the styling and fit is excellent, and it holds more than i expected.  it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder.  i purchased the black version.  with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong!  amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag, and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them	1
They're pretty, but flimsy.  Very light construction.  The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it.  It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off.  Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face.	0
My son loved these jeans.  The jeans were very comfortable. The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect	1
I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore	0
Good quality workmanship, very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit. 
Bought one for my new ipod nano, a total disappointment. Very poorly made. Only glued together not stiched up,It already started to go apart. You won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small.  Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out.  It looks pretty but that is all	0

the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience	0
I would buy another one. 
The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty	0

All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money	0

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0

It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well	1
I saw the reviews and ordered the bag, the first impression was it looked pretty good! I was happy, if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. I had to trim to remove the hanging threads. There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 
The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy. I think it is real good	1

This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud. 	1
don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 
I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my "Birks". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them "Birks" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.


The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.
I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the "nice ones". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.


On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).
I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. 


if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag	0
Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.
First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans.  It was ridiculous.  I went back  to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned. 	0

Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund	0
So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.
Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available.  Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back.  Bad experience	0

Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory	0

I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it. 	0
I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. So bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did.
I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.	0

I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them.	0

Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes	0

I was able to track the progress of this item, and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped.  I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me	0

Also, item shipped is not item pictured	0

The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap.  I bought
These are very cute and they fit great.  I wear them all the time	1
it for my wife to carry "all that stuff" to work.  With out the strap it does not work.  I requested another one, got it, no strap.  On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.
ordering was easy, arrived in 4 days, gloves fit, well and good quality, good buy,recommend  to purchas	1

When I play basketball, or in the past when I did Jiu-Jitsu then too. Anyway, they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don't pull or cramp. Anyway, I guess they look o.k. too, but who would see them anyway...THEY'RE UNDERWEAR!!!!

I just got my pair of sandals.I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying. Although very cute and trendy sandles, but are very uncomfortable	0
take care and good luck	1
This is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe. The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow. If you are going for looks only...they are good. If you want any kind of foot comfort...skip it	0
I LOVE this shoe! 
     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.
It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.
     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.

     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order	0
If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.
I LOVE THE STYLE, FABRIC, FIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE (BUT IT IS A T-SHIRT) I'M 5'2 AND IT DOESN'T COME PAST MY HIPS	0

The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night	0
The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.
I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality	0

the material is nice, but the size is too small.  I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee, the sleeve is too short	0
HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!	1
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	0
This is not a basket short or soccer short, NO!!!! it's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country... With hot beaches all year, and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities.. That's why i bought it and don't mess the shoppin	1
I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...	0
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 
I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas.	0

I would not recommend these hats. You definately get what you pay for. The sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed (even for a 6.00 hat.) I basically threw it out. The sad thing is, I spent as much in shipping as I did on the product	0
I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.	1
I wish there was a rating of "0".  This was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided.   The armband cut through and tore the back completely off.   I am returning it	0
I have to say, those crocs are the best. they are super confi, and light... I recommend them	1
I would have loved it if they sent it, but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock & on it's way, the company fessed up that they were out of the color that I chose. The other color that they wanted to sub. looked pretty bad so I cancelled	0
     These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift, walking on concrete floors	1
The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.
I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color.  They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors!  The straps are VERY comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining.  The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes.  I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church, where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad!  It's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels, so when you can find them, stock up on them	1
Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.
This purse has a lot of positives going for it:
Thanks.
1. Great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous.
Jeanne Alle	0
2. The color is very glamorous.
This wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from Brazil.
3. It is a deal at this price (although I bought it when it was $5 higher)
Maybe is good for another country`s document	0
4. It is unique and I love it because I am unique :)
this product never made it to destination. it was purchased with pants to match(which were pin-striped and didn't) and it was never sent to the recipient, nor was i invoiced, so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point, or even if they intend to send the correct pants??? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday, and the wrong products otherwise, i will not purchase from this seller again	0

Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side	0
In short, I love it	1
There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it.  These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person.  Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric.  They're not made for warmth.  All around disappointing	0
I have arms like a gorilla, so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. They fit even my appendages nicely. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I'm glad I did, for the large is a perfect fit on me, and I'm pretty slender. The material is fairly thin, but not see-through. Overall, I say this shirt is a good value	1
I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken"	0
I never seem to have luck shopping for bras, so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read.  They were a great deal and a wonderful fit.  I would highly recommend	1
THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS	0
This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal	1
They were very cheaply made,Thank goodness they were just for little girls,I would have been embarrassed if I'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.I know I shouldn't expect alot for $5., but I'd have thought they'd be better than they were	0
This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us	1
I love the cotton color, just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks.
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica	1
The show style it the most unconfortable of any Clark shoe I have have. There is something strange about the left shoe, it give me a blister everytime I wear it	0
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!	1
It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it	0
Highly recommend shoe, BUT you might need a larger size than usual. I wear Easy Spirit 7 1/2 W but found this shoe too snug in both width and length, and had to return	1
Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $20 to return/exchange	0
These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em.Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots.  These shoes are very comfortable	1
These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears. These splits, although tiny, allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles. I still wear them, but now only for fashion instead of function	0
The presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable, comfortable and goodlooking	1
And poison ivy in my mouth wouldn't keep my hands warm. These things itch like hell. I know, they're wool, but shut up. I think whoever made these had to steal the wool. No wonder they felt so bad. Get it? Steel wool? Ugh, go away	0
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN PUCHASING FOR 15 PLUS YEARS. CAN I ORDER MONOGRAMED SHIRTS FROM THIS SITE	1
I bought these for my younger than three month old son, he didn't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt.  I ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together.
I gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them, she says they are really confortable, and i find them really pretty. A really good buy it is	1

Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't "hand wash only".	1
I do not suggest that anyone buy these	0
I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.
I wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie	0

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
I wear low rise jeans, shorts, etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up. I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I'm giving a show or not! They're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. They're very sexy too!
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit.	0

The item looks cheap. I ordered a medium size but it was 2X bigger than the regular size. "Ugly	0
I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. That's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. And... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color!
i quesss for the price you cant beat it, but i think it should have said patch leather, or leather pieces, also the size runs larger, than regular coats, xl was really more like an xxl.but like i said for the price you cant beat it, i really should have invested more and got a better coat.  thank you    dlan	0

Didn't like the way these boots fit. The souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked. They also looked really wierd on, they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways. Returned them and paid for the shipping myself	0
Go for it!!!	1
I broke through the toe on the second wearing.  Lousy product	0
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.	1
I keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices $9,10 or 11, where are they?  How do I find out	0
As a new 36DD (can't wear underwire) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market.  For the past 5 years (since my surgery) I've been searching for the perfect bra.  I have finally found it! 	1
super low price advertised on 'select sizes and colors'.
recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials	1

A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.
oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price	0

This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed. 
The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.


It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either. 
I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.


I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me. 
My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.	1

These are wonderful sandals. Tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail. Finally did the right thing and went online. Great Sandals at a very reasonable price. You won't be sorry if you purchase these. Very stylish and very comfortable	1
For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target	0
these are the most warm and comfortable slippers.  i would recommend these to everyone	1
Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product.	0
can't believe how true to size they are. They're quite easy to move in, and they're simple and beautiful. Not at all cheap-looking for the price. I expected less and got more	1
These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.	0
I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.	1
I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it	0
I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.  They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on.  I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive	1
TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN	0
Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. 
i didn't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don't like it it's feels it's for old ladies	0

I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard	0
Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. 
I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee	0

Got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced!  I've literally never had a pair of boots that need THIS much breaking in and I own LOTS of boots.  Makes me not even want to to wear them	0
Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this "no-show." I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) 
When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping	0

When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back	0
For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. 
This bra is definately not for the over B cup set. The openings are too big and you'd be better off wearing nothin	0

had a hard time using this thing. first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip, then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt. I went back to using my tie bar and tack	0
This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not "cling" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. 
I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through. It's a blue shirt so I can't wear it to work now. Unacceptable in a shirt of this price	0

When this product was ordered it was to be a 9 1/2 Wide when it was recieved it was a 9 1/2 Medium. We live in South America and they were brought by some friends and now we have shoes that don't fit in a different country	0
The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. 
It has a very loose fit and I feel a little silly, but pulling it out of the package I totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me. It is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly	0

I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop	0
May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! 
I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".


I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection	1
However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose	0
Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight	1
I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.
These are exactly what I was looking for.  I've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years.  Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement.  After I received my first pair, I ordered enough to last me another 20 years.  I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days.  They are uncomfortable and they cost more	1

I'm in love with these sandals.  Although they are very lightweight, they are vastly more substantial, supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops.  I may have to buy another pair.  If you're a half-size, go down not up	1
Thank you, Robert But	0
I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer.
Not only charged 8.99 for it, 6.99 for shipping! Its a cheap plastic toy. But my grandson begged for it, and against my beter judgement, I ordered it.
I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc	1
Save your money. Its worth a buck, if that. I cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage. Shipping is a complete rip off, and I will never order from this company again	0
I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter	1
The garment I received was labeled large.  In fact, at best it is a "small". The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled	0
This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.	1
The tape didn't stick well - plus the packaging was misleading, the box said it contained 2 bras (which you really need when the tape on the first one fails, you can try the second).  I threw it away	0
The jersey of our #54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy.(With the jersey NOT Grossman	1

My 11 year old wanted these shoes. All her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair. Plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for PE and the palyground. I would buy these shoes again, without a doubt. Keds makes a wonderful product and I think she'll out grow them before they even think about wearing out. Great value for the money.	1

These shoes are so comfy!  I love the no shoe string thing too.  Easy and comfortable.  What more could you ask for	1

I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it.This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE!!! With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player. My husband got it 100% right with this little surprise. So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price!!!	1
   I thought this product was going to be easier but i have found it really dosent work the tape dosent like to stick to your skin and i think the sizes are off i wear a 38C and so i got it its like whereing a b cup not a c  well i hope this info helps people
Both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts. It was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side, so I appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future.	1

The Lilyette Maximum Support bra is well made and wears well.  It holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features.  It is comfortable	1

I have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son.  I took A kid's review's idea and got one size smaller for my son.  I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good.  I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me, I don't know why, but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness	1

I travel a lot, especially during the summer months, and these packs are the best thing since Ziplock bags!!  They are a must, in all sizes, for the traveler.  Helps things and people get/stay organized; an absolute must!!
I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point I can no longer wear it.  Bummer after just wearing it once	0

Item was called "Fleese" but was 80% cotton and looked & felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&H. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai	0
I love naughty monkey! I'm so happy with their shoes! They don't hurt my feet	1
These compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind I have.  Aside from the low grade material and poor stiching, the waist band rides up around my chest!  It looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall	0
This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available	1
I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade	0
I bought these slippers for my mother, who is 5 years post stroke.  She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke.  Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm.
I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company	0
When she wears these out will definitly by another pair	1
it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell... 
Don't know where else to find a garter panty set (arrived fast too) for this price. They say economy, so wasn't expecting much, but we're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings! We bought the One Size (for a size 8) and it is perfect and adjusts	1

Podra ser extrao regalar una prenda de ropa ntima, pero estos Boxer son lo mximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compaero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodn, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compr talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso tambin provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es ms que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebracin "Saluda a mi pequeo amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar	1
cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it.	0
Good quality jeans at an affordable price. Size is just right, quite comfortable	1
I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg. 	0
I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price	1
Was not the same boot from the pictures. Got very sad when opend my packet	0
They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great	1
The writing was peeling off this badly.  I can't let me child wear this.  I threw it out	0
The slippers were perfect, exactly what I wanted.  The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do. Thank You very much	1
I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited. I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time	0
Great slippers, very comfortable. I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure.  And the black ones are perfect because they don't show dirt like the white ones	1
This luggage did not last for even one flight.  It was torn in the corners and the handles were broken.  I did contact the company and was given a full refund though	0
Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head. 	1
i got the largest size they had (size 10) and my toes were crunched in. they fit my mom just barely, and she's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it, but it'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back, then it actually costed to begin with.	0
These boots are so warm and soft! I usually wear a 7.5 and I ordered them in size 7 (even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes) and they fit perfectly. An awesome (and cheaper) alternative to Uggs	1
Am I the only one sick and tired of this t-shirt???? Give it a rest already!! I can't browse without seeing it, the dead horse is beaten to oblivion!!	0
Very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed	1
I love the t-shirt because I loved the movie, but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms, this may present an issue for you.  The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit	0
I LOVE my new Steve Maddens!  They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly	1
I bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it.  The quality is poor.  The wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way.  Also, the wallet actually looked fake (not sure if it is) because the XOXO is upside down.  You cannot tell from looking at the picture.	0
This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable	1
The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months.  The bag is now basically unusable.	0
They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again	1
This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.
My mother loves these pants.  I know they are for men, but she loves the way they fit her.  They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better. 	1

I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.
These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.


In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. 
The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great	0

I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money	0
The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.
I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals.  The Betula sandals are clearly inferior.  A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.


I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.

A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.	1
With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item	0
I bought this bra because I was tired of seeing "nursing bra" lines under my shirts.  This is great.  I bought the L++ and it fits perfectly.  I am a 38DDD normally and durring my pregnancy a 40DDD was fitting too.  If you buy this bra, you will love it, just buy the correct size	1
I ordered the jacket pictured, but I received an entirely different Bernardo jacket.  Customer service re-ordered for me and I got the same incorrect jacket.  I wouldn't bother ordering this unless customer service assures you that their inventory glitch has been corrected	0
This is just the perfect accessory for the CATS costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital. Got this in gray and brown too! Took a while for the product to get here. In fact, I had to re-order because of the delay--but when finally the product arrived, it was worth the wait	1
You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!!
Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.	1
I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ......	0
I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too!
I liked the boots in the first couple of weeks-they are very warm and comfy, however they are not at all durable -after a month of use the soles had holes. My freind who had them experienced the same problem. 

They are great feet warmers when the weather is dry, but they are not waterproof.	0
I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while.
I ordered "classic" jockey breif, which I currently own, but the new units received are approximately 2" taller on each side when compared to my current briefs, both labeled Jockey Classic.


These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet	1

i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts, but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good, the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them, and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer	1
I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did	0
I like the flip case. It is exactly what i wanted. However,the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it.	1
Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls	0
 FIT IS PERFECT.  VERY COMFORTABLE.  4 STARS.   WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.
The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back.	0
                              MARY S	1
This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.
These black satin Isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well. They are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet, as well. They are well worth the purchase	1

I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased	1
There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.
Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	1

For the money, these are a great value.  Unlike a comment above, I have not found these short at all, but average in length	1
The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.
love these little gems... perfect at 1 size below normal size.

you won't want to take them off	1
There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)	0
I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin & wool lining is very sturdy & luxerious	1
The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.	0
I really like these.  I do recommend getting a size smaller. I normally wear and 8.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly. super comfortable!	1
I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars	0
Yeh, these are really great socks... but what's up with James? If new socks changed my life, hey I need to get a little something goin' on. Back to the socks...my favorite, in black, low cut, workin' out or hangin' out	1
Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
I love this jacket.   It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather.  It is also long enough to cover my rear.  Very good in the rain, too	1
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service	0
My boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in New Mexico and I have looked everywhere for them.  I gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates	1
Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  This shirt is large in size but very short!  Not what I had expected.  Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter.  I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem. 	0
This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself. (Don't tell!) 
Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it.	0

The Zen cover didn't work that good. I had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the "buttons" because it was not made right.  I ended up taking the cover off and don't even use it anymore. It's not worth getting	0
Not high fashion, but very warm and comfortable	1
The sound works but the light does not	0
I bought this for my boyfriend. It is soft and comfy. It is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with. And as a bonus he likes it too. My only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long. But overall we are very happy with the purchase	1
Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.	0
I love this skirt.
I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful. 	0
I wear it with my "Live a Little" denim jacket, so cute.
I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy. 
I find it to be really figure flattering.
They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet.	0
I ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect.
I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment	0
Nice to find a denim skirt that's a little different than the other zillions out there	1
i ordered this buckle, the one shown in the pictures, and i received a different buckle, a red white and blue confederate flag, not the knife/buckle	0
I like Bike swimmer jocks. I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?	1
Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier.  Don't buy if you are planning to use immediately.  This is where is I got very discouraged.  Just haven't had the time to play with it so it's sitting in the box	0
I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women's Perfect Fit Full Figure, black, 38DDD.  This bra provides much better lift, support and separation than the Olga.  I think it is because the cups are seamed.  I'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (I'm 5'2"), and also has a large bra size (I'm a 36DDD).	1
I ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves Happy Bunny.  The pj's were cheaply made and the pants were very short...it didn't say anywhere in the description that that were capri length.  They were definitely not worth the price	0
I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great. 	1
The product is as described and I'm sure for some ladies the product would be great.  However, for whatever reason, the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and, the material was more see-thru than I desired.  The product is well made with no defects	0
If you are a grandma on a budget, it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons.  I thought that this was a good buy at $7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or Christmas.  I would have given five stars, but there was not a complete list of teams offered	1
This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture. Loose threads on it. Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift.  I wouldn't recommend this item.  It definitely cost more than it was worth	0
These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites	1
I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	0
i have purchased other hats from well known companies. these hats are great for the money and are constructed well. good job!	1
This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals	0
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended	1
For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable	0
These sweatpants are extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...Definetly a great buy..	1
I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!	0
I found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great.
I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on.  The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible	0
I recommend this for anyone looking for great bag, especially as a gift	1
Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away	0
i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes..!!	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
I am very happy with my velour slippers .They are a perfect fit and very comfortable.I received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future	1
These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply	0
The shirt came fast.It's a good quality shirt.I'm satisfied with it	1
This bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra's I've tried.  It's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin.  I would not recommend it	0
This is great.  I measured before I put it on & after.  I lost over 2 inches.  I highly recommend this	1
Who would ever wear this monstracity? First of all you got no color, no padding, no pazazz! This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic. It is also from a company called Jerzees and it's not a jersey? What up with that? Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave	0
I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!	1
For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people	0
I really like this case, it fits so perfectly that the Zen doesn't rattle around or anything, yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible.  Easy to get on and off, too, and looks great	1
The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.	0
These keep your feet warm and toastie. Will want more when these wear out	1
These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.  
This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga	1
My advice: DONT GET THESE FOR A BIG, TAL MAN THEY'LL MMAKE U FEEL LIKE A GIANT	0
It is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys...instead of me carrying them!!!	1
These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  
I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right	1

This is a Great Gown for the price. It's comfy, soft, and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. Moreover, it's sexy! Hope yall enjoy	1
I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot	0
Very happy with this product. They are substantial so they are &quot;suitable&quot; for a Medium or Large and not someone who is Small.
I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.  
 

 Delivery was fast and it was well packed. Shipping was included, though I didn't realize it until the end of the ordering process.
I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick	0

I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16	0
These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking.  They are comfortable and a great buy.  A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe	1
I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.	0
The service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly.  Just what I expected and wanted	1
It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information	0
I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being. 
Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable, rubbery, poor traction giving and painful sole.  I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper	0

I did not order any red drawstring backpack. There is obviously a mistake somewhere. I gave this One Star because there was no other way to send this to you. Someone is tinkering with my account. 
I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall	1

This is the fifth pair of Club Cs I've owned, the second in black. I believe they're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market. I'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out	1
I love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already! Can I send them back	0
These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price	1
These pants are fine if you have a very short rise, but I can't imagine that they would fit most people. I will be returning my order	0
Love them.  They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes, and give the right support when doing a lot of walking, but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes	1
The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product	0
Having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves, my husband keeps returning to his favorite, the Land's End pinpoint.  Without a doubt, the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! Now, when its time for new shirts, we don't think twice and go directly to Land's End and order.  They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all	1
Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again. 	0
All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also	1
For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic "torpedo" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable. 	0
Purchased this for my son. He loves wearing it (he's a big fan of ny and the pd). Fits well, washes well	1
We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you	0
excellent product for the price  a lot cheaper than the bridal shop  fast shipping  thank	1
I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!	0
I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38. 	1
I don't think these Skechers are made out of leather, so I'm very disappointed.  I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer, but with such a low price it was "too good to be true"	0
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift	1
sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.  
Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for?  My husband was very pleased	1

My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. This new pair of Clarks, the Citadel Oxford, is his new favorite because it is light weight, casual, and so comfortable.	1
1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe.
WOW.. what can't I say about these shoes... I've bought two pair in different colors & absolutely LOVE them for their comfort and snazzy, fun appearance. They're great at work and at play, and even during outings that require alot of walking. Highly recommend!!	1
2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick.
GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.	1
3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.  
Reef makes the best sandals, the price is pretty much set, no real savings here, but the selection is great.  They may look like other sandals, but don't be fooled... They're TOP NOTCH	1

These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. 
this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair	0

While they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they aren't even close to being "leather." I don't think I would have bought them if I saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand.  Not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller	0
I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.
I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking	0

Tan color looks very synthetic, cheapens look of shoe.  Also very wide fitting	0
In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today	1
:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.	0
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)	1
You'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult. Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me	0
Size was true. I just did not like the	1
accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side.  all my other zippered garments come that way.  this turfer men's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward.  would not buy again for that reason. 
These boots look good with jeans. Can be loose, but comfortable with thick socks	1

I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them	1
this shell is otherwise nicely made	0
I love my Birkenstock shoes.  They fill great.  I am a registered nurse. I am on my feet constantly all day.  These shoes are great for the support my feet need.  They are really comfortable. I will definately be purchasing more in the near future. 	1
One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...  
This was inexpensive, attractive, excellent windbreaker. Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip. 	1

I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase	1

This item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that I purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running. Other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase	1
didn't like these.  infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o	0
I am very pleased with the soft briefcase I purchased.  It is so much easier to handle than a hard one.   I would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if I need something else	1
I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally. 	0
Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased.  The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it.  So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent, plus the product.  I have received no satisfaction	1
I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.	0
These jeans are extremely soft and comfortable. Like most children's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands. My only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker. My boys are tough on their clothes	1
I bought two of these, hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event, and quickly returned them.   Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term "charmeuse", and are thin and gauzy.   They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz, much of that must have been the packaging.  A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction	0
We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.	1
I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).
Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe	1

I am very happy with this product, its comfortable and good looking. Worth buy...	1
At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!	1

I had the worst feet!  I ran my first marathon in May, and I was in a panic.  On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit!  My feet hurt so bad!  I was training on a lot of downhill runs, and therefore landed on the balls of my feet.  Ouch!  I think I would have been better off to run in nothing, than to wear what I had, which was a top of the line shoe.  I was desparate!  I found these Asics GT 2110 Men's Shoe (I'm a woman) and I felt 100% better!! I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet, what an awesome shoe!!  I finished my marathon in them, I couldn't have done it without them.	1
Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere	0
There aren't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team, as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time. Red Sox hats, however, are just such an item. Go Sox	1
The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 
This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great. 	1

these panties fit great wash after wash. great quality and very smooth under dress or pant	1
There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection.	0
The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.	1
The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again	0
bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for $19.99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. Love the comfort of them, think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide & sloppy on my foot & the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes, I wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not, I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals, perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. I am a self-professed shoe addict & these are great for those days you want only comfort	1
These are paper thin cotton and feel rough.  They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate!  A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan	0
These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN!
The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them	1

Most flattering yoga pants I've ever worn.  I have an akward figure, long waist, big butt, a little pot belly, but these pants look and feel great.  Plus, I've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers.  I want 10 pairs	1

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned.  Excellent quality and fit. 	1
This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each	0
these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look. they also are easy on the feet. i like the suede versions best personally, but when winter hits its best to have the leather	1
I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment & they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one	0
These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.  The construction is very sturdy, and the pockets are a great bonus.  I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair	1
I really wanted to like these, but they just won't stay put.  It's not a thong, but it will be after a few hours of wear.  I usually love DKNY products, so I am disappointed	0
I was very happy with my last order. It was easy to order and didn't take long to get the product. My grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning. Thank you so much for the great services.I will use amazon again and tell my friends about i	1
The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was.  My son exchanged it	0
My 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys!  Great product and very well made.  Can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter	1
I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite	0
My son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse	1
Item is not authentic. Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole	0
I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband, he LOVES it.  It's comfortable, fits well and looks new after multiple washings.  Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon.com.  I ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn't the watch that I ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising.  To top it off their customer service was not good, when I called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated, the products were all GREAT and the service was great!	1
If you return items Amazon will charge you for shipping both ways whether the product was satisfactory or not.  Don't buy from Amazon	0
These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!	1
I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.
This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon	1

This was a long over due replacement for the Dopp kit that was given to me when I left for Vietnam. Its changed very little and is still of fine quality. I expect it will provide all the use I'll ever need	1
Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good..	0
i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print. what is the status of my exchange? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products, they are great	1
Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all	0
This was a Christmas gift for my friend's husband. He really liked it and said it was excellent quality	1
"I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you. 
I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps. They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day, even when I have just gotten it done, and keep my ears toasty warm.  Great product and worth the money. My daughter is equally impressed.	1
 
These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly	1
Please withdraw the feedback:" -JTF Trading
they were slightly small and a tad too stiff.


Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me
but very cut	1

My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too	1
"Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading
after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it.	1

I was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats	1
Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed. 
The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing.

Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers.
Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product	0
Haagar has done a terrific job again	1
I'M JUST NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THIS THING. DOESN'T QUITE FIT RIGHT OR LOOK RIGHT...AT LEAST I ONLY PAID 5 BUCKS..	0
I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.
Thin cloth...aweful insulation factor,,,,does not look good on me..	0

they are very shiney and but not very comfortable at all and the arch is funn	0
About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.
I ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends Juilliard.  They looked terrible because they were shiney.  The worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange. 	0

I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price	0
I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others	1
I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.
I have a wide, relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit.  Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me, so I have been loyal for the last decade.  I can't find them in my area, so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them	1
By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing	0
You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too	1
"Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Big time	0
When I bought these shoes I didn't know they would look so pretty. I am glad I bought these shoes	1
The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's "profile" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about "low-rise"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear	0
  Purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them. They fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line	1
I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.	0
Russell!  I really wouldn't buy any other kind.  Too bad they don't make concert T-shirts!  Great material, long-lasting.  The best	1
Bah, this skirt looks weird and cheap. It is not sewn on the bottom, just cut.	0
These are very pretty without too much fluff. The leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab. I love them	1
I bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife, my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match, I'm really pissed off, if you gonna buy this piece of junk, beware with the size	0
This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.	1
I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now	0
i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home, tried them on, and i was absolutely amazed. They are a bit of a low rise, but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to, and once you find the perfect fit, you can hardly even feel that it's there. I give it a perfect score, and i am definatley going to buy more of these	1
The color you think you purchased might turned out to be completely different. I recently ordered a blue one. From the image, I was expecting a light baby blue skin. But when I finally got it, it's a dark navy blue. It looks nothing like the one shown. Also, it's constantly attracting dust. I am very disappointe	0
Good quality for the great price.  Bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect.  Item was on backorder but still received in less than a week	1
This was something that I could of bought at the flea market for 20 bucks and it cost me $60 with shippng. The leather is cheap, it is so thin that they lined it with batting to make it feel thicker. Buyer beware. Would not buy again. Bottom grade leather :	0
This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what	1
This is a very styling money clip, however, it is not like a big paper clip. It opens like a butterfly, then closes together with the strenght of the magnets. It feels that your money and other cards might fall off. I'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information	0
I bought another of Clark's sandals a few years ago, which is why I ordered them again. These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! There was no break-in period with these shoes..I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. I will buy more in other colors I'm sure. You can't go wrong with Clark's	1

This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear	1
The styling is not good, and the fit is poor.It does not resemble the photgraph.
the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money.

i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my Zen. just plug in and walk away, not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly.
I would pay ( at most) $ 5.00 for this dress	0
the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set.
The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all	0
the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did, so it was sent FAST.
"Classic" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now "spinning"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not "classic!" 	0
i love this.

I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices.  The only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil.  I don't know how durable it will be, but I'm hoping, very!!

What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine	1
Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality	0
I purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months. The shoes are very comfortable and look very professional. Love them.

Strong and tough.
Even though I bought these for $9.99 I still somewhat regret it. The quality of the jacket is "really" poor. Every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed-- from the pockets to the zippers. While wearing it, the jacket smells like "paint" or what they used to bleach the colors on. I hope the smell gets out after washing. I am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when I wash it and onto my other clothes	0
Not to heavy. Has good grip on snow.	1
I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets.
These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks.  No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up.  They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant.  Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you've ever bought. Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store, but still well worth the price on Amazon.  Buy lots of them	1
You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.  	0
Got this for my father.  He loves it.  Great coverage.  Easy to use	1
IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE.	0
      Was shipped very promptly.
I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put. 	0

This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund	0
My baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old.  I ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months.  They are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months. Hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture. You do have to tie your own knot on the top. Andrew Christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days, but within the shipping time specified	1

Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it	1
$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.
It clearly says it is a MESH dress! I wore this for my wedding, outside in bright sunlight, and it certainly did not show everything, but do not expect it to be completely opaque, as it is a MESH dress with delicate lining.
Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.

This is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not "TSA" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.

This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all. 	0
Boots are warm & Cozy. However, the color was much lighter than pictured...not the end of the world. Also, the shipping took longer than expected	1
The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase	0

Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain.
I bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I own. I am a little ashamed to admit that I don't use it when exercising, its so comfortable I use it to lounge around the house.	1
The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain.	0
I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding.  It arrived quickly, looked great, and was an awesome price.  It would be hard to beat this great deal	1
I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.
I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.	1

The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase	1

The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase agai	0
I've been buying these sandals for 30 years.  I just love them	1
I had to send this item back because it was to small.  The sizes run small, so beware	0
Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now	1
i never recieved the product.
Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.  	1
the order was cancelled by the sende	0
this case is really nice and compact. there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside. is snuggly fits the HP digital camera. protects well. and well padded. very nice case	1
I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles	0
This polo is absolutely fabulous! I love the length, it comes down to my hips. I bought it in the size I usually wear and it fits great! I wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic. I can't wait to buy it in every color	1
The pajamas are way to long.  They look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall	0
I love this Laptop Tote. It's big enough & ready to take to the pool	1
The trunks look great as long as you don't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see-through.  I guess that could be advantageous for some, but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches	0
I could not find these slippers in our local stores.  I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item.  I ordered them, they arrived and I love them.  It was a very easy, customer friendly process	1
In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.  
nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash	1

They are a great quality, comfortable boot. And the price was far less than local stores. The shipping at regular rate took over a week, though	1
Good luck, shoe shoppers	0
I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots	1
WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight!  You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...	0
I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer.  Comfy & perfect for elliptical trainer, stationery bike and weight room.  Very stylish, I love Skechers footwear	1
You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.	0
IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU, YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE, LOTS OF ROOM! I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY	1
I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available.  As far as appearance, it is well crafted.  When it comes to functinality, it stinks.  Here are the problems I have with it:  1) there is no hole for the microphone,  2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.  This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.  This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player	0
Bought one, loved it, bought another one for my d-i-l, she loved it, bought one for my daughter, she loved it .....you're probably getting the picture now.  I bought the next size up for each of us, and it's wonderful with a shirt or light sweater underneath.  Oh, and did I mention the incredible price?? 	1
I bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is.  i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back.  Very rude	0
This workout is short but you will feel "worked out" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.  Definitely "shocked" the muscles	1
I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort	0
As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.
I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry	0
 
This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck. It is light and drapes well. But it is too light for printing.	0
Once we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.
I purchased this as a gift for a teenager.  She told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper.  It is being returned	0
 
I can't imagine who could pull off these clown pants. They're unwearable!  What was Hanes thinking?	0
Tina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.
The product was not quite what I expected, but I got a quick return to my satisfaction.  Happy shopping	0
 
I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this. 	0
Beginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.
Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way	0
 
This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.	0
I have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. 
i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like	0
 
I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful	0
Overall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper	1
While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.
This is a VERY sexy pair of underwear. Guys: if you're new to the thong/g-string scene, this is a good place to start. I recommend g-strings because there's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs.


All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product	0
The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear. Your girlfriend will love it. Mine did	1
this device didnt work properly at all, i lost my money on this purchase.sorry, but that's how i feel	0
This item was just what I was looking for.  I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband's ties or a tie bar.  It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving. 	1
Plugged it into my wife's car. Set it, listened to 1/2 of a song, then went to remove it to try it in my car. The plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter, leaving part of the plug in the jack. Returned it, Satechi sent my refund quickly	0
Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much	1
I love the color and the flexibility of the material. It doesn't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection	0
The product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product	1
I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing	0
Great product, works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description....Thank	1
They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me	0
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon	1
Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again	0
They are awesome, only tricky part is making sure you get the right size, my husband and I love them	1
never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items. contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $45.00. tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info. on their web site. live and learn won't shop amazon again! thanks 4 nothing amazo	0
I am a product junkie and I never would have believed I could fit all my stuff in this bag, but I did!  This bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags I had been using!  I am getting one of these for each of my sisters..	1
Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.
As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child	1

Before seeing it with my own eyes, I was a little skeptical of the huge buttons. After wearing it, I felt they were hardly noticable. I bought the brown version for $17.99 and I thought it was well worth it. This jacket is surprisingly wind resistant, ideal for cold weathers. The pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there	1
Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.	0
I love this boot.  It's high, and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter-y, but it's a great look.  The leather and detail on my pair is exceptional.  Green leather inside.  I really like these.  And I own 55 pairs of shoes/boots - know from whence I speak	1
Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. 
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank	1

it's comfortable and stays in place all day. it's wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day. I am so glad I bought it, and it I got it delivered fast!	1
Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.	0
I love this case. I purchased many cases before, but this offers the best protection at a very low price.
This light worked for one day. I should have known better because in the past, I bought a tap light, and it worked for only a few days, too. Don't waste your money	0
Thanks. CoverCas	1
I have a small head and it makes it look huge!
I got this jacket when it was $50.  I was very impressed at the quality and i like how it's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it.  Great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time	1

The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt	1
Maybe if i had a big head it would look alright  pfff	0
I've owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use, proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one's pocket for spare change	1
I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice	0
this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall	1
Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price. 	0
Great cap.. quality is top notch.. Price is also great.	1
These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again	0
i got and love it. however, someone else's product was shipped inside the box. it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box. the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it. I contacted them and sent it to them myself. it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy. I hope all that get things for others send it to them too! you never know whose life depends on it	1
My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on	0
I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets.  He LOVES everything about it - especially the fact that it is the Bears!  =	1
In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose 	0
Better than just a beach tote, sturdy bag for any occasion, good price	1
Good features include many pockets.
I'm very happy with this tote bag. It's huge and sturdy. 


Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.
I've been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking. Quite a number of my colleagues like it, too	1

I really love the way these shoes look.  I am really picky about shoes I buy.  I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that.  They actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is.  I wore these shoes all night on new year's eve and had no problem.  I also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high.  I love these shoes so much a have 2 pair, black and red.	1
Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets.	0
I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching.  And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.  
I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product	0

Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better	0

I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.
I was shocked to see how high the heel was, and being in my 40s I wasn't sure if I wanted to find out how they felt.  But I had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how "walkable" and comfortable they were.  I have worn them several times since then	1

have spent years looking for a bra that feels good, does what it's supposed to and didn't make you wish you could get home & slip out of something so uncomfortable... at last i think i'm at the end of my search.  very comfortable, great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies.  only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps	1
This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."  Ahem.
I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you	1

My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas.  He said that they were warm and soft	1
In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): "quality is a subjective issue."  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.
This bag is great!  Very fashionable and protective of my laptop.  Great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones	1

I absolutely love this case! The cool thing about it is that it doesn't look like a regular laptop case (i.e. the bulky, usually black, boring, case). My best friend didn't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself! It makes a great gift for any soon-to-be college student	1
In their defense: my money has now been refunded.
Been purchased many pairs Keds shoes, 

very stylest and comfortable.
Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.
Me and my mom love them	1

This is a very nice leather bag.  It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over.  The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed.  That is the only problem I can see with this bag	1
Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.	0
Love the shirt!  This was a birthday present for my son.  We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again	1
The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use.  I won't recommend it to anyone	0
These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.	1
for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe	0
Columbia sport sandals for kids are great! We've bought them three years in a row now for our kids.
I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice "just because" gift. When I opened the package I was really disappointed. The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together. 

Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad. The problem with returning is the non-refundable $7.50 to ship to me and the $5.95 I have to pay to ship it back to them. 
They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.  


I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn't find my order.	0
They're well constructed, but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while. They won't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size	1

I love these shoes! They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes	1
Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..	0
This product is fine, however it was much too baggy.  I'm not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with the short, but I just wish I had bought a smaller size.  Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product. 	1
I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise). They are beautiful and comfortable (I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon.com	1
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.
I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The "backpack straps" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it	1
The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag	0
Very quick delivery.  Price was very good compared to other online companies.  Will use again	1
This shoe isn't as comfortable as my other Keds shoes.  It also doesn't breath as well.  If you have a tendency to develope hot feet, this wouldn't be a good purchase for you.  It also needs the new insoles that the newer Keds shoes have	0
This bra is very comfy and also quite sexy for a sports bra!  I am a b cup and am using it for low to moderate impact activities and have found it quite supportive and comfortable	1
So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic	0
I purchased these slippers in pink, and not only are they super cute, they are quite comfortable and very warm.  The sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most, but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it's cold out. I would recommend them. :	1
These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0
These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too.	1
I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy
Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. 


I made a mistake by buying i	0
The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!
This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic	0

A year or so ago, I bought several of these on sale.  They are poorly sized (I have 4XT), far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably.  Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit, but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat, I'd avoid buying these	0
I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.
The shoes are true to size and very comfortable. But only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate. 

Really expected a better quality.	0
Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!
Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use.	0

I gave these slippers to my mother for Christmas and they do not hold up well.  The first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair hasn't been washed yet, but they're already coming apart also.  Not a good buy.	0
SMILE	1
They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times!  I expected more having paid nearly $20 for a pair of slippers.  VERY dissapointed	0
They looks nice, and fit really well, however, not so soft like some other Clarks/Indigo. 	1
after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen	0
Fits, Great quality,great sale price- If your lucky you don't get what you pay for	1
I didn't purchase this shoe. I ordered two pairs of another Dr. Scholl's that day.You must have an error in the records	0
I ordered these robes (in white and ivory) as Christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law.  They arrived quickly and beautifully packaged.  
This item is not 100% cotton.  Rather, it is 100% polyester	0

We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk.  Rather stiff and uncomfortable	0
Last week, I was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa.  I was concerned about the one size fits all sizing, but I was told that she loved the extra coverage (she's probably a size 14-16) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline (I buy him XL sweaters).  
Very nice feeling robe and fit well.  Although I only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone.


I will order one for myself as soon as I am in the market for a robe. 	1
My wife is now making me one instead	0
The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the "just out of the shower chills" that you get. It doesnt quite have the "luxurious" feel of a spa robe, and the thread loops are matted in certain areas, but quality wise it is better than anything else I've seen for similar prices. The length is much shorter than pictured. I bought this for my boyfriend, who is 6 ft, 190 lbs, average build, and it comes just above his knee! All in all, it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it.	1
I purchased this expecting a high quality Satin robe, but what I received was a run of the mil polyester robe. Yes, it is shiny, but it feel like plastic.
El producto lo recibi en perfectas condiciones, excelente comprarle a ustedes.-

Sadly, this will be returned	0

We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive	0
The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side	1
the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it.  fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box.  i tried it on just to see if i'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition, and it was NOT cute on.  i immediately returned it	0
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!	1
Originally ordered a COMPLETELY different model armband for 15 bux. GOT THIS ONE......we'll see if my 80 gb video will fit.....doubt it....AMAZON....bad call on this seller son!!!	0
I have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister's wedding. It looked amazing!!!
This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam	0

This is a cheap and flimsy armband.  NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.  There are much better on Amazon for less money	0
The suit arrived timely and I couldn't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package. All the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons, matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants. Even the shirt is so well tailored. 
The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)	0

The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!
My son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom!


I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company	0
I sincerely recommend this product	1
The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
 My husband bought me these for Christmas and I have had more compliments on these!! The flare styling and laces set them off 	1
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you	1

I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured	1
So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended.	0
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected	1
I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer	0
I actually purchased the Silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend. He loves and it was much cheaper than the one Creative offers on their website.	1
 I would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all. The silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night.	0
I LOVE these shoes!!!!!they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price.i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase	1
The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.
Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy	1
They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.
For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.  I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room, but a Medium would have been too small.  Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to.      	1
I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them	0
Birkenstock clogs are the comfiest shoes. During a recent trip to Washington DC, I was the only person in my group whose feet didn't hurt after several hours of walking. I have had several pairs over the years. They last forever and go with tons of different outfits	1
If you like cheap furniture you'll love this boot. The slave labor used to make this boot was wasted	0
I'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me. Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have 'em on. Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long	1
The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want	1

These are my new favorite boots!  The detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels, they have a bit of a platform so I do not feel wobbly at all on them.  I'm really happy with my purchase	1
Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time	0
I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.	1
I received the wrong size originally. The company was prompt in sending me another dress, however, I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted.
Was delivered quickly, was priced right, and folded up into a small size so I could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation.  When unfolded it held more than the suitcase.  High quality material and excellent workmanship.  I think I'll buy another one for a spare	1
 The dress is lovely	0
this is a great wallet! it fits into small purses. the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards, your id and a small zipper section for some money. it's not meant to be a complete, big wallet. i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around. i don't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore. love it!	1
I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case	0
All my Gold Toe socks are excellent, but these offer extra room and are extremely comfortable, especially after the first washing. I am about to buy another pair! The Trellis style is the other wonderful Gold Toe sock for comfort	1
The quality was very poor, it was very wrinkled and to thin for a mens winter sweater. I send it back	0
Absolute gems.  Simple, versatile shoes that are fun, comfortable, and have great casual style.  I have them in red, wear them to work, when traveling, and the one time I got stuck in a surprise Seattle snowstorm, they even had traction.  Nearly an all-purpose shoe.	1
I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.  The material feels like paper and the seams were all crooked.  Then, when I returned it, I got an ugly email.  Keep looking; for the price, you can find something of much better quality	0
My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!	1
Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.
I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress. This scarf was perfect. It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap. Very pretty	1

Great jacket, excellent feel. only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket. 5 stars for the leather itself, soft and very comfortable. change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99% of the time, and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket!
Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.
also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin	1

I'm shocked I forgot to write a review about these jeans. I love these jeans. They are by far my favorite jeans. The fit is perfect and allows for room to breathe. I love wearing these jeans with my boots on a daily basis. I can't say enough about them. I tell everyone about them. Even for a petite woman the fit is far better than anything I could find in a local store. I am completely satisfied. They also have a very modern look to them	1
Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...
I buy these wherever I can find them.  It's a bit of a tribute to my aunt, for her middle name, but wish I could find them more frequently. 	1

This product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim (so many types of luggage are similar in style and color, we've had trouble in the past).  Several of our family members were given new luggage for Christmas and these tags were included. These tags are big, bright lime green and can be easily seen. No more headaches in trying to find our luggage. 	1
Very Very bad servic	0
The product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what I had ordered.  I really like it	1
Not worth the price at all...
I love these shoes! The service was great, the price great! These are really good shoes. I have a hard time finding wide shoes where I live. These were perfect! Very comfortable, very good quality. This is where I will be buying my shoes	1
The bead work looks very cheap...
on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio	1
The color does not look the way its shown in the picture.
I found it very comfortable with good fitting. I bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best. I gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that I bought. Overall quality is good.	1
Decided to return it the moment I opened the box..	0
Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. 
I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 

It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.	0
After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.
it doesnt fit well. the joystick doesnt function right with it on. the buttons are difficult to use. the product was poorly mad	0

My son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp & he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play	0
The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves
I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age	0

Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs	0
The outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. 
After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.	0

The length of the jacket could be a little longer...bairly hits the belt	0
Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.
Hey! I'm twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these. They feel really nice on the skin and they don't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do. They also give really good support to your penis. They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort. Boys, ya'll all seriously need to try these undies out. They're awesome	0

Dont buy parents on less you want to have to remove your kids under wear from there butt's or if you want to tie a chain and lock around there pants so they dont get panted, so dont but these because removing under wear can be award	0
The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.
i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.

i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg.  there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric, but there is more like 3 inches...yuk!  ; b
Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.	1
has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured?  (the ones that we all seem to love and want)?
These shoes are so comfortable and cute! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, and I like their old-school Pony look	1
please email me personally if u have found them!
I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn't see the item but was told it was very cute	1

This brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image; leather is well-stitched but thin. Old-fashioned style with no credit card slots. Snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile; not a front pocket wallet for sure. Purchased two as gifts for nephews, will probably get one for myself. 	1
Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again	0
These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had them.  The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time.  The fit is perfect and comfortable	1
I ordered these based on the picture---a high cut brief. These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them! Rip off!!! Zero stars	0
I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai	1
My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return	0
These were purchased for a wedding.  The quality is very good.  We would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black,pink, grey, and white.
The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.	0

This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund	0
Thank you,
Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM	1
These socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams. If this sort of design bothers you (as it does me), then these are not the socks for you. These socks cause a lot of discomfort for me	0
I initially bought these shoes for my mom for a Christmas gift, but she said they were too high for her. Well i fixed that, I kept them for myself.  :)
I would not buy this sweater.  It is flimsy, and not very quality feeling.  The price was too good to be true	0
I love them and they are really hot! 
I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe	0
Thnx
After one washing, the letters were all rolled up. I was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie. The quality of the graphic was horrible	0

The upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge.  The shoe portion fit.  I have relatively normal-sized calves and I was swimming in these boots.  I immediately returned tham	0
My  only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff
These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product	0
Otherwise Great Gym Pant	1
Awful fit!  I usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me, HOWEVER, the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls.  At first I thought it was the size so I purchased another and found the same issue.  Steer clear of this model	0
I was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet.  Not knowing if it would fit.  I think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right.  Also, the picture is on key with the actual product.  My loved it and so do I	1
slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed. construction was cheap, goose fill was light and overall flimsy. if you want to wear it twice, then thats what its worth	0
This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount.  Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though	1
I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily). 
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine	1

I love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them.  I am the envy of the girls at work	1
I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.
I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!	1

These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color.  They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.
I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general	0
But, as a general rule when buying Italian clothing, *always* buy them bigger than you would expect.  I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too "huggy" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more "delicate" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.  I *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath, feeling the soft cashmere on your arms.  	1
i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing	0
We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season.  
I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 	0
Unfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails.  We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching.  We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond.  We will never order anything through Amazon again	1
I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now	0
The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.	1
Found the item to be poorly designed. Did not fit my checks or recorder. Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear	0
Love it...Love it...Love it!!! Every football fan should have one. It is perfect for tailgating. This is the only site I could find it. Great price and the free shipping is a great deal. It also shipped really fast, faster then it had originally said.	1
Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 
I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's	1

The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.	1
Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 
Good material and does the job that it promises!! All other brands claim to do the same thing but "not all glitters are gold" :	1

great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting	1
The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.
I have worn nothing but levi's for over 20 years now, and I have been through almost every style of them.  These are still the same great jeans, reliable fit and quality that you know.  Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505's, and they are virtually identical, but the signiture series cost a lot less. Same thick denim material, unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans, that last a long time, and can stand up to most activities that an active person does.  Check these out, you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet	1

I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm. Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well (my head never feels too hot)	1
For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.
I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite	1

A great shoe! I was very impressed with the softeness of the leather, immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe. This is definitely a well made, year 'round slide. If you are looking for a classic loafer; this is your shoe.	1
There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.
the shawl was beauiful and just the right color. an excellent value too.very good product fast shippin	1

I love these pajamas. The color, the softness (get softer the more you wash),and the fit. I had purchased these for an older friend and found I wasn't able to part with them so I made it up to her in other ways. Never done that before...shows how much I like 'em.  	1
Not happy	0
Arrived fast and in time for V-day! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival	1
Have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems. This time was different. They sent the wrong shorts. I paid the shipping to send them back. I asked, please send the right shorts. They credited my account an amount smaller than I paid. And that was that. Certainly not satisfied.	0
I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY	1
I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item	0
i tried these on and i'll never wear boxers again!
I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size. 
They are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight.

they are tight, but not too tight. I wear these to school
When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing. 
as well! I love them	1

It's a very nice polo, very soft and nice to a casual date	1
That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair	0
I bought Brown Burnished color of this variety. After I got them, I tried them on and these are, simply, fantastic. I liked the way they fit onto my feet. My feet are wide and hence I had ordered a wider version of these. They give you a very comfortable and stable feel when you have them on and walk around. The sole looks very sturdy and durable. Does not skid over wet surfaces	1
A beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder. But the problem is when I put the checks in (regular sized) the cover will not lay flat. Perhaps it will after awhile but I've never had a checkbook cover do this before. I can't recommend this item	0
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :-	1
I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it.  I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16, but the shirt was about the right size for me (an 8).  The quality seemed to be fine, but the sizing was very misleading	0
It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out.
The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm


I wear it cycling and golfing	1
thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.	0
Since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse, I cannot give my own opinion of the jeans, other than to say I received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what I had ordered	1
I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy
The wallet was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  He loved the wallet, the leather, the design, style, and sleek look of the Fossil wallet. It was a great purchase and a good value	1

this is a form fitting, but not to snug nightshirt. gives freedom of movement, yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material. deffinitly will order more of thes	1
I made a mistake by buying i	0
I hate long socks and smelly shoes so I've become a big fan of shoe liners.  I recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them.  They are each individually priced at $5.99.  So for 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail.  So this is a good deal at $4/pair.
i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it	0

It was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back. But the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal Van Heusen shirts	0
More importantly, they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam.  They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet.  They are cut generously -- My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big, but manageable.  If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L.  They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.
   This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed, I will not do it again. The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it.

   I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and I was ignored. Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late. I thought that the time limit was 180 days.
I've tried a lot of these socks:  Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Peds, Leggs, et al.  These are by far the best. 	1
   I like everything else about the jacket, but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration, there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there	0
I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.	1
 These boots where definitely a disappointment from Kenneth Cole. They did not resemble leather in the least.  They looked terrible on me; maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on.	0
This is a great idea that is not apriciated until you go on a long trip and end up with dirty wrinkled clothes that are all thrown into a bag. This keeps clothes seperated and organized and easy to repack if you are moving from place to place	1
Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps	0
Great grip, cool rugged look, comfortable enough for regular winter use as well. Was about $80 when I got it though. Might not be the best option around for $130	1
The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

PROS:
I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.
This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!

It's an easy to put on short boot. 
The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.
(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)

The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.  
If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO	0
Stains will wipe right off.
I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..
I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young

professionals to wear with their slacks.
TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.
Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.


This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...
CONS:

Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.
I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...
I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.  

The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.
Thanks, hope this helped...	0
The zipper is not the best quality.
I returned this bra to exchange for size the day after I received it in October.  It is now January and I have not yet received the replacement.  I have called several times but to no avail!  I can't give a good review of this product because I haven't actually gotten to wear the bra	0

Buying this was a mistake. This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt. The straps are not comfortable, it's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded. Def. not what I expected from this product. The material and pattern is the only thing I liked; it has a sexy look to it	0
Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!
I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.

The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all	0
Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order	1
Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!	0
I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet	1

I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things. 
These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.	0
I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits. 
I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely	0
I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say "wow this feels great" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the "different" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point	1
they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing, they really shrink..
Spectacular item.  Wears well on a fine woman.  My wife is short, and this item fit fine, especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall	1

I searched the Internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes, but discovered they were no longer manufactured.  So I went to Amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the Gold Toe.  The price was excellent and my son likes them very much.  (He's very finicky about some things and it was a real "if" to try something new)... I'm so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn't work out.  My son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby & discovered that the Amazon price is very good; so now we know where to go when he needs some more.  Thank you, Amazon	1
I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money	0
The shorts were everything I wanted. The service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time. I bought him all the colours available	1
Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.
My child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it.  I allowed it because he has not worn it outside.  Of course, he wore it the following day to school, rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day.  


At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.
Very comfortable and cute shoes.  I might get a pair for myself	1
But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.
I own 2 pairs ...They are classy and go with everything,but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it	1

These shoes exceeded my expectations, in that they are very lightweight.  The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber.  Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber, but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned.   They look good, they are very comfortable--very little, if any, break-in time.  If you like the look, it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel	1
Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me	0
So far I have been very satisfied with this bag. For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use. 
The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.


I'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last. 
Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time	0

I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic	0
I use it to hold 2 1" notebooks, a textbook, a portfolio, a book, a calculator and my pda. This is about maximum capacity. I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections.
I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern	0

These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!	0
The handle ontop is cozy, the over the shoulder strap should be wider. 
Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much	0

After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.	0
Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and hope that it lasts	1
I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL???	0
My son used these socks as part of his football uniform.  He said they were comfortable and I was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week.  The didn't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks	1
I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.
This shirt is very cute, but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear. My child normally wears a 24 month. I ordered the size 2, and it's much tighter and shorter than her other tops	1

I am very pleased with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look great as well. 	1
I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere	0
It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.
I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.


I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.
Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.


I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It "flows" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel "rich"!
Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time	0

I have purchased these beloved sport pants for years. The cut of these pants has been changed with this order. The quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now. I returned the item	0
Overall, I like it	1
I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?
The wand is sturdy, full-sized and nicely designed, even if made of plastic.  The kids wanted their wands so they could play "Harry Potter", so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available	1

This is cute, funny, and it's not uncomforable! I think it rocks! I love this movie...I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
The overall quality of the garment is excellent.  The fabric is of very good quality, as is the stitching.  The sizing is also accurate.  However, the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered, but a substitute!  Thus, four stars, not 5.  In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable	1
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  
These SOX are the BEST my husband has ever used. He has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash. He has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w/any sox I have found for him until now. These make him VERY HAPPY!! Thank You	1

My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots.  I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them.  I don't know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas.  I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes, yet!  Overall, I think the socks are great. 	1
It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...
These socks are really comfortable and they really stay up! All other brands of over-the-calf socks that I have tried won't stay over-the calf. Within a few hours, other socks are sitting on my shins. I have worn pairs of the Gold Toe Over the Calf Athletic Sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch. Great socks	1

This is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra I have even owned.  Have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now.  The fit is unbelievable	1
That's not all the changes.....
This sandle is very comfortable and attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle	1

Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking	1
They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.
This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.  I purchased two, one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage.  It is more accurate than bathroom scales.  If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror. 	1

Was shopping at the mall.  This item caught my husband's eye in the window.  We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses.  We actually bought one for ourselves.  It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home).  Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight.  I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't.
The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....


We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages.  It's a two-man operation.  My husband would lift the luggage/bag, then I would look at the scale quickly	1
The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.
I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today. It was on sale for $49.99. Needless to say, I bought it right away at Amazon since it was $39.99! It fit me really well, I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened, it was comfortable all around. I really like the mesh material at the toe area. I'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months! This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day. It's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe.	1

The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service.	1
They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.
We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for "bib goodies" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)	1

See my review for the Desert Digital.  I own both the woodland and the desert BDU's	1
Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.
Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate.

thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo	1
Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.
This bra fits, is comfortable, and invisible under T-shirts. I hope they keep making it forever	1

This bra is great for those of us with smaller busts.  It's the only bra I'll wear under my t-shirts now because it doesn't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra I've found.  It VERY comfortable.  The only downside is that mine did lose it's form (it's not as tight fitting as it used to be) a little bit faster than some other bras.  But, it's absolutely worth buying a replacement.  I just hope they never stop making this bra	1
Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.
This is a nice case if you are looking for something compact.  I have a Kodak Easy Share digital camera and it fits perfect inside.  The case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage	1

I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one.  It is awesome.  The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn't way too tight or super big.  I wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it.  This bag fits it all perfectly!!  It isn't too small or too big.  The camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there.  I wouldn't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is, it isn't big enough for that	1
I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class	1

This is the best style and fit of underwear that I have ever owned. I have been buying this style for almost 7 years now. It gives me the support and freedom that I need in physical activity and the comfort I desire in everyday wear. Plus, it provides you with a nice lift and profile. 
I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.


Note, beware ordering through Freshpair. My order took 1 month from them	1
BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T.
I love it. It is just what I wanted. Great deal and smooth transaction. Thanks	1

I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years, yet wasn't going to take years to pay for!  (HA! HA!)  This is a nice checkbook cover for the money.  My only complaint is that it needs to have a "tab" to keep your check register open to the page you are working on.  However, it does have a "loop" to keep a pen inside, you should desire to do so.  All in all, a good buy	1
IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION.
Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions.  It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot.	1

speedy delivery  product  as  stated   would buy from them agai	1
SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????	0
Best sock in performance that I have ever tried.  I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed.  No sagging, no defects.  The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.
Good short sleeve shirt, but I ordered a long sleeve	0

Broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars.  Wouldn't recommend	0
One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again.  If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.  
I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.	0

I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.
There...I actually wrote a review on socks!
Not that there is anything wrong with that. ( Loved that Seinfeld episode	0

The slipper seems to have some craftmenship. In my case they seem to run about a half size small. Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch? I wish I had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though	0

I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman's guide.com. When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking. The black pair was dull and had no shine. Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes.
I bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described.
All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned
And to the reviewer who backpacks: If your that hardcore of a backpacker, you might want to consider spending more than $6 on a fanny pack. Seriously, lighten up and review the product, not tell your life story	1

This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!	1
Save your money and lock your luggage with cheap lock ties.  Our TSA lock was cut the very first time we used it.  Turns out the ENTIRE terminal has only 1 set of key so screener just don't bother /have the time to unlock this approved lock. 	0
This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt.  It is unlined, has a bit of stretch for comfort, and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts. I think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter, and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt. It was almost thirteen dollars then, but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal	1
I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them.  I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs.  Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful.  They were returned...  If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size	0
I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong. I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site, at home, out on the town, etc. These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag	1
I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in	0
These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either	1
Don't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes, however, I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site. Nowhere on the products site was the (red) "Outdoor Plein Air" color shown as a choice	0
My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great	1
incorrect color was shown on the website.  it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase.	0
These socks are wonderful.  Just the right weight, very comfortable and warm.
Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them	0
Don't fade after washing, etc. etc.   I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more	1
Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one	0
I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.	1
I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway.
The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price.  Very satisfied	1

I where these shoes all the time. They are really comfortable to run in	1
Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn	0
I like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean, although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean. I have a high arch and they seem to support well so I would say over all they were a good choice	1
The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb "was"?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash. 	0
Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox	1
This is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me, or most people I know.  36" bust, 33" waist and 41" hip?  FAT FAT FAT!  What about us tall slim people	0
I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.  
I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.


My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them.  I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.  
The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear.	0

I got this because I thought it was a good deal, but the clothes weren't very cute and weren't good quality.  I gave them all away, I don't recommend	0
The size is perfect, color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.  
I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products. 	0

I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful.  The Lalita is very uncomfortable.  They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub.  I was truly disappointed	0
I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least. 
I bought 2 of these least year. First the ID info came off enroute, then the green rollup part came off coming back. Will not purchase again	0

This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.	0

This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric!  There is no shape to the gown...AWFUL	0
I've had foot problems this past year. Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years, including other Rockports, Ecco, New Balance, Avia, Reebock, Asics, etc..., were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long.
I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.


These Rockports are great. I'm finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. I was to the point that I'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is well worth the money	1
I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 
I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs. Not only I did grow up wearing their brand, but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs. If somethings not broke why fix it	1

Backpack is light when empty, yet strong to curry the load of books to school. Side pocket for bottle very handy. Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys, very helpful and practical. I like the base of the backpack being dark color so  it doesn't look dirty from use	1
While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks "repaired" so they never really wear out.
I love these bras so much! They are so comfortable, any other bra I wear now feels weird. The only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying, otherwise their my very favorite bras	1

I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. Thanks	1

This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in "hand" is worth the added function of "wicking" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.	1
Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.	0
This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company. 	1
I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0
Love Hush Puppies.  They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable	1
I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper	0
The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job 	1
I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.	0
Great overall shirt.  Good quality, wears well.  Wear it proudly	1
One shoe did not fit properly--also didn't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking	0
This sweater fits perfect - exactly what I was looking for and I coudn't go wrong with this fabulous price.  My husband liked it as well	1
I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable
I bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend. She loves it, and has told everyone about it. The color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional, and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse, lunchbag, and carryall	1
and because they looked like they were made of leather.
Comfy, tough, lightweight, wrinkly (like me). Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. Good stitching. Velcro back pockets will save your wallet! Doesn't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets. Not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything, but just perfect for active soccer Dads or when the family hound insists on playing Fetch with muddy logs and the like	1
They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not
Like wearing a moccasin only with more support. More supple than most Driving Shoes, and light weight too. Soles wear very well, as do uppers. A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe, yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal	1
attractive.  They will be returned.  
So glad I didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards.
	0
It's been 6 months since I wrote this review, and I only become more satisfied with this wallet. All my cards are easily accessed, viewed and I know immediately if one is missing. The leather is silky soft and durable. People have been asking where I found this item. I think it's the best I've ever purchased	1
First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear	0
We ordered this case for our son's Creative player, and it's a hit. It fits snuggly, he can access all the functions with no problems, and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and "leashes" during different activities. 
I guess you get what you pay for. the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item. It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat's litter box than a magical device	0

In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back	0
A great value for the money!	1
I received wrong item, but there was no service after that	0
I just don't know where to start.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to describe the comfort.  You will just have to try them on to believe it.  My neighbor, mother, husband and I all swear by this product.  Accept no substitutions.   Attractive...no, but the comfort will blow you away	1
I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition	0
These are the best ever!  I bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because I had seen similar 'crocs' at local stores for far less.  Well, these are worth every cent!  My daughter and I went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand...no comparison!  These are the best	1
I ordered a small, it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow	0
I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet, ankles, knees and hips. I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the "teeth" in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. Being diabetic, I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase. A little expensive, but well worth it in the end. I plan on buying more	1
My mouth dropped when i received this item.  the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use.  For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets	0
Soo comfortable and soo warm.  The only thing that sucks about them is that they aren't waterproof	1
The bra came well packed, speedily and it is very like the picture and description.  The fit is good	0
I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy	1
Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
I read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big. So I always wear a eight and I ordered a 9. They were huge on me. I sold them to a friend. also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot. I'll stick to my Ugg's	1
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Please note, I did not find the need to order up many sizes.  I only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  Nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction, nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back.  I loves these boots and at a great price too.  Fast efficent shipping as well.  I should say that I bought a pair of White Mountain Suede Shearling boots and I was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality	1
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too	1
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	1
Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning	0
and I am very pleased with them.  They are very comfortable!!  My sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	1
The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
This is my husband's favorite shirt because it's light and comfortable. It is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat	1
     1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.
These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn.  They are worth every penny, in my opinion.  They are designed for a man, plus they seem to not gather moisture, as some fabrics do	1
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)	0
I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying "Dopp" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.
I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope.  I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store.  I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf.  It was a wasted of money	0

I want to help overseas products, but this advertises itself as cashmere. IT ITCHES MY NECK! Cashmere does not itch. Color was not represented appropriately	0
Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.
The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.
	1

It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way	1
Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.
This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe.  The material is good, the size too. The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side, but it after 3 days using them it was ok.


A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.
Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one, if you pay less than $50 will be fair	1

My twin sister bought these for me, and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable. 
I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph	0

These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are	0
Breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first. 
These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.	0

Good socks. , nice material. but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it. They are knee high and stay up, provide good warmth in the cold weather	0
But now, they feel stable, comfortable and easy to walk it. They feel perfectly balanced and I've never experiance blisters in these shoes. 
Ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities. I was still cold. Just a regular average socks, easy to wash and dry so great for travelling, nothing more	0

This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic	0
Two thumbs up	1
Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them	0
I really liked my tote bag.  What I liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that I use mine to tote my books in college.  The only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping.  Let me tell you when I say the company sent the bag "stuffed" in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship.  That was foul!  Despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and I guess I shouldnt complain as much	1
I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
For the price, these bags cannot be beat!  There aren't terribly large, but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that I purchased for my girls.  I am having them personalized and they will be ready to give	1
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  
I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly. My only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99, otherwise I highly recommend this bag.	1

I wasn't expecting much based on the price, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order. The tote is a nice size, made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well-sewn. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. This was a great buy	1
*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me.  Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes.  It fits me very well, looks great, and is comfortable.  The color, Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. I do recommend the shoe, and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet	1
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible	0
Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, "Be the first person to write a review"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?  
These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0

I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy
Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.


I made a mistake by buying i	0
I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!
While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.


These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. 
Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned	0

These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.
Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a "ten tippy toes" rating for how well they performed in the test.	1

This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes.  It's light weight and flexilble, but still supportive. Well worth $30.	1
With a longer inseam, these would be awesome	0
I love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable.  The heel is not so tall that you feel like you can't walk.  Customer service and shipping was excellent.  Best price I could find.  Don't hesitate on this purchase.  You'll love them	1
Extremely poor quality cloth. Very bad color. It looks used .
Protects the Vision M without restricting it's use or synch connection. Flip screen provides extra protection but doesn't always stay in place. Shipping took a little longer than expected (more than a week) but was reasonable	1
Never ever buy any items from this vendo	0
After having purchased the DLO sports case for my Creative Zen Vision M, I read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight, scratching the unit, and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player. I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. 
pants were strangely short and bodysuit extra long. also there was a tear in the sleeve of the bodysuit. the quality of the fabric is poor. it served my short term purpose, but i wouldn't purchase this same product again.	0

I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.  I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand agai	0
The case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. 
I bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use, a pocket ripped so we will be returning it	0

Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand	0
The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product. Highly recommended	1
The sleeves on this fleece are very long.  I have a 34" sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands.  Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece.  I returned mine	0
Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that.  I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks, nike etc, I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back !!! Its like walking with slippers on. I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down. Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!!  I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe. Buy them you wont be sorry !! Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !	1
I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.  Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours	0
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy	1
I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these	0
These are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but don't leave marks.  they stick to your head the same way.  I have used mine in several Triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed. 	1
These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply	0
I really liked the Black Tuxedo Outfit, my son wore it in a pageant and won, so I am very very happy about that. The tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him	1
At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0
I purchased this tuxedo outfit w/vest for my son who was in his aunt's wedding.  He was 18mos. at the time.  It looked wonderful on him and fit nicely.  The pants were a little long but other than that it fit very nicely on him.  The tuxedo was true to size of my child.  Fast shipping from retailer as well.  I was very impressed overall	1
I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase	1

If your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you can't go wrong with the cami/panty combo. Its cute but sexy. Very nice	1
As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.
I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well	1

This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever.  I highly recommend it	1
After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.
I just purchased Fleece Hoodies and pants by Andrew Christian, the material is wonderful.  The hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin.  I would recommend them highly.


With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.
The pansts are low-rise, since I am older, I am still getting used to that, but they too feel really good on.	1

More than pleased...excited.  The price was better than local stores; should have purchased several pairs.  Easy on the feet, wear well, and on and off at the airport	1

My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter.  They are perfect, washing easily, and retaining their size and color	1
The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off. 	0
These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking.
Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper. 	0

My "tween" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.
Very happy with them and the price was right too	1
They are comfortable and stylish.
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear	1
This is her 3rd pair.
Girlfriend loves these gloves, they were thicker than her original fingerless globes, however she complained about the thumbs.  She wish they had a better way to hold them on the thumb, and when not in use to restrain it back	1
I'm glad that I found them online.
Got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well	1
They are both old-school and stylish	0
I purchased the white entrance wedge sandal by Steve Madden from Amaon.com and I LOVE THEM! They are so Cute and they go with everything! Perfect fun shoe for the beach, or for a night out! People compliment me when I wear them and you will not be dissapointed! They are so comfortable and did I say that I love them! :	1
I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices	0
This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.  	1
Looks great on the web, don't think many would buy it if they could examine it in-person.  
This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed. 	1

These shoes are the best!I like the removable wheel! You could heel to school
Shame, colors and style are excellent just let down in quality and fit	0
and when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on! You will be heeling across the  floor in no time if you keep practicing on them! It took me a while to get the hang of these shoes! You should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes! They are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels!	1
The pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it. 	0
This is the best brand of slippers I have ever owned! I have a cute pink pair that I slip into the minute I get home. They have lasted for several years now, and they are still in good shape.
saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, A&F, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..	0

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  
These slippers are so comfortable, and they stay on my feet without any effort. They are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm, and my feet never sweat in them, even without socks! 


The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 
This style runs large, and I wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers. After wearing them the first week, I noticed they got a little roomier, but they still stay on just fine.


I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  
They are my only pair of house shoes at the moment. I just ordered a new pair in a different style (in pink, of course), and I have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me. Try Dearfoams and your feet will thank you	1

Quality product, exactly what I wanted, but it runs large. I wear a half size, bought the size larger & now think I'll buy the smaller size	1
The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  
Very warm and comfortable for the price.  For any price, really.  Nice, looks good, feels comfy, keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least	1

Good bag, I thought it was a little bigger, but it worked out great	1
Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.
I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too	1

Esta tienda es muy rapida en contestar y enviar el producto adquirido.
I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.
Es toy muy contento con el producto que adquiri por que es exactamente lo que deseaba.	1

Very comfortable and feel. No one makes it like Under Armour	1
I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. 	0
Brand New, tags and everything !!!  Arrived within a week, no glitches. Just like ordering new from catalog. Will search and order again for merchandise all at fairer price or even 50 cut of new brand name items that either are not in stock in your size, or can't be found in store or are marked up 20% 0r more!
This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one. 	0

Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.
LUUVV ITT!!!!!!!

BONNI	1
As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating	0
This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  =	1
Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22	0
   I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price	1
I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
This swim jock is a great all around jock.  Very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps.  Mine has taken a beating, and has not fallen apart like other jocks I own.  The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!  If you're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear, this jock is a great buy for the price. 	1
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army	1
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT	0
The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product	1
These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.
This top runs small, so order next size up.  Vibrant colors, nice fabric, comfy, attractive fit.	1

The product arrives just as shown. Sturdy, attractive leather. Just the right size for small items. This is an A++ product	1
I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.	0
Good quality, well built vest of full bodied fleece.  Vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in.  Sizes run alittle large.  I love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest	1
I got these for my son before he arrived in the 0-3 mos size (blue).  They weren't even blue, they were purple.  And, they were so big they fit my 14 mo old, but the arms were too short for her to wear them either!  What a waste of money	0
I bought this because I needed something to run in as well as use as an "all around light weight jacket"  This does the trick, very light, great in the rain. I am very pleased with the product and the customer service was top notch	1
I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 
I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them	1

I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and give great support. These are my second pair. The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that. Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that	1
Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.
I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate, which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches. Asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which I love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints,until I found these shoes. I absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again. This is the only type of shoe I will ever buy and has been the only one I have bought  for 7 years now ! I highly recommend this shoe! Especially if your feet tend to overpronate	1

My baby loves his new kicks!! They came quick and would recomend them to anyone	1
Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.
My husband is a big man and very rough on belts.  Most belts last him a few weeks.  This one has lasted him 3+ years.  The only reason I'm buying him a new one is because he's lost so much weight.  There's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt I'm replacing.  Definitely got our money's worth out of it	1

Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles	1
If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat	0
The boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside.  These boots will never disappoint...they are fun, warm, comfy and stylish!  Dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out	1
I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them.
I bought these just a couple of months ago but i've already put them to the test. I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico, I ended up covered in mud, my new shoes included. I was worried they would be spoiled (it really was a lot of mud). Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone. Besides being really comfortable, it's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job.	1
After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back. 
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.	1
Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!!
Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.	1
Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them.	0
For me, they are very difficult to put on.  I have to use a long shoe horn. They aren't tight, in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm. They look great if you like the UGG look.  I'm hoping when they loosen up, they will be easier to put on.  The top scrunches down when I put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on. It could be me though!Otherwise, I love everything else about them.
I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!! 	0

I don't recommend you make purchases here. I spent $61 on these items and have only recieved two. There has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order, or my money. Patiently I've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing	0
This was a very nice item.  I bought it for my mom for christmas.  She loved it.  It was shipped very fast and I was informed very well on shipment information.  This shoe was a great deal.  Usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal.  Thanks!	1
Not as expected, too short,   nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks	0
Very comfortable, but the straps keep coming loose. 	1
I still got a pantyline with this---strange and frustrating----
My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter.	1

These are perfect for low-rise pants. The cut will likely be flattering for any guy. The front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability, and I find the fit in the back to be basically great. An essential for those whose jeans hang low	1
On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank	0
The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now. 
Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product	0

The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips.  I am a 5'6" 120 lb. small boned female.  The company offered to exchange it, however did not offer any others with cell phone holder.  Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item.  I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now	0
My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin, not Zen screen. So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen. The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen, but that part only tells the time anyway	1
This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Excellent product. Item arrived fast and exactly as described. Works like a charm. Haven't yet had TSA open the lock, but it does the job	1
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Once my best friend described my bra size as "beige."  Meaning that when you shop in the "full figure" section of a department store, you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.

After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
If this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bra for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.  The cups do the supporting, so the bra doesn't need to have those super-wide, heavily padded straps.  And it gives a good silhouette under clothes, but will also look nice by itself	1
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
What can I say, these are pretty and practical. I know my boyfriend is going to be impressed, after the shock wears off. I like these panties, I like the lacy look, so divine, and I like the way they ride pretty low. And they don't show through your clothes. Like my dear gal pal Ophella, I can imagine a naughty situation or two where I could have a little illicit and harmless fun. Yikes! What am I saying	1
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review	0
Who hasn't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl? So glamorous, girly, and sexy. I was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot. They really do feel like slippers, just with the heel as a bonus. I normally wear a 6W or a 6 , so these are a little snug, but not too bad. So glad I bought them- two pairs red & black. Pink will be next..	1
I was mislead by the advertisement. The shorts are skin thin and don't have pockets in them. Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour	1
Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker, maybe not	0
Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:
The plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean, and very easy to scratch, so the view quality was horrible.  Also, the case was WAY to tight and was difficult to get the 30GB Video iPod in and out	0

I had to send this item back twice and still havenot recieved the correct product never order anything from Best Price Center, the owner denied being the correct contact after I spoke with him multiple times at the same number.	0
1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.
I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!	0
2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.
I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith..	0
3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).
These gloves are very soft and seem to be made well, but they have a big flaw:  the fingers are too short.  Ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems	0

These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.

Now there are a few things that may give you pause.
Hole in pocket, not completly sewn.

Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes.
1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.
Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve	0
2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is "substantial", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.
We could not use these shoes.  The tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on. They were even a 1/2 size larger than our grandson wore.  It was a big disappointment and waste of money.  Save your receit	0

I bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size, I bought an 11.5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe. Be very caefull when buying I suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size	0
This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again	1
The scarves were good quality but I should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift.
Excellent quality for the price I paid.  Very happy with purchase. Arrived in a timely manner	1
the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors, nothing like the picture. save your dough on these scarves	0
My husband really likes the Intimo Men's Classic Silk Pants.  They are very comfortable, and the color is really nice.  He wears them almost every day!
I never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status. This left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays ...I am out the money	0

Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.
The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length	1

This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)	1
I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this	0
I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.  
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES!! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26, AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES??? I'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK!! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR (WITH LACES) AT A BETTER PRICE.	0

I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.	0
I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, "Opaque Tapestry," maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra	1

Really uncomfortable. I wore them twice and then threw them out. They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little. And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment. Not worth the $5 I paid	0
I  just love the color and the way it looked on me . IT  is a very very pretty jacket 	1
This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each?	0
...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more...
I ordered these White Tank Tops and 3 colored Tank Tops.  I have never received these White Tank Tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither.  I have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve	0

I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr	0
I now own three pairs	1
I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money	0
After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase, a leather bag tag is what i needed.  They stay on the suitcase and don't break	1
These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.
These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price	1

This company gave me very good service. They called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct. I was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color isn't large but that is okay. They were out of Granny Apple and so we had to get Red	1
The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that	0
Very comfortable.  Better quality than most.  Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside.  Sizing appears to right on for me.  I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right.  The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe.  I doubt they will last very long outside, but who wears slippers to the store??  Highly recommended! 	1
I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received	0
Good construction and material for the price.  Size seems a bit different in L vs. R unless I am more asymmetrical now than I noticed before?  Nice sheepskin material.  I am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc I purchased by Acorn	1
These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again	0
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 
  These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.  

  They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes	0
I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.	1
Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking & the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far.	0
 This product is what I expected when I buy a Carhartt product.
I never receive this ITEM, i want may money back or replace my order	0
 It's a quality item and worth the money I spent	1
The sleeves are long and the shirt is short. I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes.... Wont look to good with low rise jeans! At least not with my average body. I dont weight 95 pounds	0
Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players, well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads, but it didn't stop me from being active later in life.  With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways.
These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots	0

This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders	0
So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more	1
I purchased what I thought were "deals" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed. 
I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish. I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms, but they are very expensive. This is lightweight, made of cotton, so very easy to clean. I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. I am very satisfied with my purchase	1

I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:	1
To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.
It's just what I wanted. I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel.	1

These sweaters are a fantastic value for $18.  Quality is excellent, though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes.  Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters	1
I hope this advice helps	0
I was pleased with all purchase.  I did not feel that I was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer.  In addition for reasons that are not clear to me, I continue to get duplicate orders, or the order is sent to an old address.  The return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul	1
and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas	0
The Disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson.  He loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides.  They are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides, but they were a big hit for him.	1
I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all	0
Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one. I ordered on-line, and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon, verifying that the size I ordered was correct.  The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.  She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size.  I love all the pockets.  It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable.  And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. The outer shell is also very soft.  	1
I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me. 	0
I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.	1
I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	0
not as pretty as I hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit. DO not regret the purchas	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
I'm a size 0-2, I ordered a size small, if I ordered another pair I would probably get a medium, due to dryer shrinkage. They fit in every way, but they are so revealing I'm barely comfortable going outside.	1
This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable.  The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material. 	0
I bought these shoes for my husband. I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday! I have owned a pair of "real" Birks before and these look identical to them. My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones	1
This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase.	0
I ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well.  I've been wearing Birks and various varieties of them for years.  I'm always very satisfied with the fit, delivery time, and the customer service that i receive from Midwest Sports. I wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow, but as soon the walkways and streets are clear, I'm back in them with thicker socks of course.  
They are warm and comfortable while they last.


They can be a little stiff at times, but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing, you will love them like no other	1

Well, since I will be using this soon, I believe it will be just perfect. Holds all the necessary items safely, so will let you know when I return from my trip	1
All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.
Material was not overly thick and designs were great! Look good on my daughter	1

At first I thought i wouldn't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on. However, this is the most comfortable bra I bought, and I bought a lot of different kinds. This is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort	1

I'll start with my stats: I'm a size 8, 5'2", and I carry my weight in my rear and thighs (all extra 20 pounds of it). This skirt is lovely, it hides what should never be seen (refer to the 20 pounds above...) and helps create a slimming line. I've worn it with silk blouses, stockings, and high heels and I've worn it with slouchy sweaters, tights, and chunky mary janes -- it works perfectly with both	1
It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months	0
I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower.  I've looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more.  These socks stay on my little boy's feet and are made very well	1
I bought these based on a previous review. After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart. Maybe the quality control person was out that day??? I returned them and got a full refund	0
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old	1
Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot. 	0
I love my Clarks and I can get such good prices through Amazon.  I have
These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable. 	0
bought two pairs of Clarks with Amazon and I plan on buying more in
those are a good shoes, but the delivery provide service is the worst, i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21  4 days more than usually delivery day, i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail, bad deal to me	0

I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.	0
The product was as advertised and delivered on time	1
very cute but have a funky balance, wobly and on the verge
These are great shoes! The shoes are a medium-to-baby pink and they're very "high style". The shoes run true to size.  The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and I got lots of raves when I wore them to a recent wedding.  They're great shoes at a good price	1
of falling over. not comftorable. poorly designe	0
I ordered these shoes for my wedding, so you can imagine my nervousness.  I received them within a week and fell in love!  I've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves!  Even at the shoe repair where I had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where I had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes!  
Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help	0
Order a 1/2 size smaller	1
I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas.  I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach.  I am really disappointed with the size.  It's pretty deep, but not very wide at all.  No way I'll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag.  Still, I'll be able to use it for other things	0
The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available.  Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don't work well.  This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet, only reduced to 4x3 inches.  Holds three cards, bills, and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards.  Great buy	1
These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply	0
These are so pleasing on the eye. What can I say besides the fact that these jeans fit great, look great, and attract alot of attention. Buy them!!	1
THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM	0
There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they're good for mountian hikers. The keep your feet warm and dry	1
I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time.	0
I love this Guess oval tag necklace.  It is just like the Tiffany's oval tag necklace, and it has an adorable little rhinestone dangle.  The best part is the price.  I only had to spend $18.00 for it, and there is also a matching bracelet for only $15.00!  I would recommend this to anyone of any age	1
I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again.	0
My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer.	1
Even though I favor leather, every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate. Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling. The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots, I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas	0
The whole Rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand.  do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands.  When it was all for charities before-thats okay.  but it is ridiculous now.  heres the rules:
I am solidly a size medium, but I was swimming in this jacket.  I think it is more of an XL.  I'd say the medium is for someone 5'10" and 250lbs	0

There was no picture of this selection, so I guessed it was a "ringer" type t-shirt.  Instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching.  I never wore it, but gave it to Goodwill	0
-Livestrong= okay because that was the original 

-Everything else= NO.  
I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot	0
-People who wear like 5 of them= Probably the main reason why you'd starting wearing the regular ones.  
I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.   It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	0

Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.	0
Plus they're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost .2 cents to make.  
Beware, the size is not true size fit

My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands.
anyways... 
this is not a small, it's loose fitting and it's a straight line cut. it's really BAD.it's so disappointing.

everything doesnt holds in places, it doesnt look like the photo at all.
END THE FAD!!!	1
the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid.
I love these shoes. I bought 3 colors and they are great! They are very stylish AND comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe	1
Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy, and if you are a medium, you need a SMALL for this dress, and it will still fit loosly on you. that's how big of a dress this is.
I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters	1
I'm returning it	0
Sharp set of shoes.  Comfortable, too, and they fit well.
size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled	0

I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute.  Other than that they were quite unusable.  I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard.  Had to get rid of them	0
But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella's Coach - while the mice were still mice.  It took FOREVER to arrive, so be warned	1
I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit.  I even complimented her on them.  I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon).  I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them.  Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving.  Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic.  I was disappointed.  If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..	0
Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic	1
These shoes are not as cute as they appear, the heel is really 2.5", the material is cheap, the fit is too wide, the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in, etc. etc. etc.
I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly	1

My husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time, he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough.  Since the Red Sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular Reebok slippers I thought it was win-win all around so I bought them as part of his Valentine's gifts.  Needless to say, they were a big hit, he LOVES them!  They are comfortable, modern looking and the Red Soz logo made his day.  I would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them	1
On a positive note, it's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress. 
I bought these for my husband, and he loves them.  The material is soft and comfortable, and they keep his feet warm.  They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers.  He wears 11 1/2 wide, so I got him the XL pair, and they fit him well	1

quick shipping and a great product, I am looking forward to using it VERY soon	1
Be warned, the company claims that all their shoes have 2" heels when they don't and they charge tax on shipping charges..	0
The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... "Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos." Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet	1
The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  
It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans!	1

Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the movie. He loved it from the minute he saw it. Whenever he wears it it seems that someone makes a positive comment about it.  It is amazing how many fans of the movie there are.
The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered	0
A great gift for Holy Grail fans	1
my daughter bought these herself, because she couldn't afford the real birky's.  she bought them in august 2006, now november 18, 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday. wasted pair of shoes.  anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys?? 
My wife used this to get a better fit into her wedding gown.  In retrospect, she wonders if it would've worked even better if she had worn a traditional strapless bra over the Shape and Size bra	1

This was a great purchase, and I love keen shoes.  My only complaint is sweaty feet when it's hot, and the shoes don't dry out very quickly	1
This bag is much smaller then i was expecting. the zippers do not open/shut easily.  I was very disapointed	0
My girlfriend thinks they're sexy and they're solid underwear.  No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs.  If you're a briefs guys (I switch around), these are the way to go	1
I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone	0
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff	1
the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc	0
This is, by far, the most comfortable pair of unders I've ever worn. Over the years, I've gone with boxers and with briefs, and in the boxers vs. briefs contest, both are losers compared to the Contour Thong. There's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. The Contour Thong has a Y thong back, and you don't need to have the body of an International Male/Undergear model to wear these. For any guy with an open mind, I recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try	1
Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my 
I am very happy with the swimsuit.  Delivery was as stated.  Fits wonderfully.  The only problem was once I was wearing it, a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing, but I tucked it in whenever it was noticeable.  I was very happy that the suit fit nicely because I was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping.  The size I ordered was the size I normally wear and as I said, it fit great	1
circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also, 
great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time.	1
the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and 
This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.
your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.

The New Balance 991 GL (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support, wear well and are well ventilated. The 991 GL carries on that tradition. Hopefully, the 992 will be just as good	1
If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.  
I am not a runner; thus, I use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping, errands, hanging out, etc.  I have owned many shoes over the years, and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I am hooked on the New Balance line of running shoes.   	1

They don't hurt the back of your heels
I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale.  But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be.  In addition, the fabric is bad.  There are tores in all of the edges	0
Comfortable like walking with socks on
This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.
Cons

Very thin,you can see your toes thru the fabric on the top.
A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses	0
Bottom line, they are a good buy for the price.  Very cute, stylish, and comfortable	1
This bra has an akward fit.  I had to return it.  A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret	0
I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. My husband loved the way I looked in it. I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy...and also because I tend to be between sizes. But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. I am very pleased with this seller. The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..	1
I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting.  By the end of my fitting, my feet were throbbing, red, and pinched.  Literally, my pinky toe was purple.  
This shoe is great. It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort. I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet. 

It was a great deal that I just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price :	1
I bought my true size, but I still don't think these shoes would've been wearable even with a size larger.  They must just be REALLY narrow	0
The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.	1
The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00	0
I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product	1
Cute designs but they shrink.  I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up. 	0
Everything you need that your iPod didn't come with, at one low price.  Shipped promptly	1
I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone	0
fits great on my ipod nano. does not slip off like other silicone covers. pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano. 
Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame.... 	0

Need to use a belt definitively. Does not look like the picture. If you do not use a belt, you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top. 
con: do plastic cover or protection for the screen	1

Oh my gosh!  I was so excited to see this item.  My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance!  I will be a hit on Valentine's Day with this gift!	1
The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift	0
I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	1
These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them	0
My husband, the Star Wars fanatic, loves them!  Very comfy	1
This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!!	0
I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing. The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees. 
These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice.	0
This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!	1
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)	0
Great item!  Have already used several times and is exactly as is described	1
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended	0
This is a really soft, and very comfortable pillow.  It is priced great, a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows.  I am very satisfied	1
i love the colts, but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large, it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen. the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight. i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward	0
I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes.  I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable.  Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too!  The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again).  The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy.  I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes	1
The sweater I received was extremely thin: I had expected something more like an LL Bean cardigan, which I dearly love.  I was wrong.  What do I do now?
I ordered this boot in a size 7, Pewter.  Very cute boot and fits perfectly.  Very comfortable fit and feel.  Everyone who saw them wanted to know where I got them!  Simply darling boot	1

I have really enjoyed my sunglasses.  Quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item.  Would buy from again	1

These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected	1

This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers.  The last ones stayed with me for three years.  They are so good, I stopped using the "big, home set" and use these type daily.   Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long.

After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe	0
Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl.   Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl	1
The stockings were not in the package, and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place. My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call. I will not do business with this company again	0
I bought this pump in Bonsai color. The pump was true to size. They are more cute than in the phot	1
This product worked well in holding up a strapless bra, but after a few hours, my skin developed a blister underneath the tape. I would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters, so use this product with caution	0
This was my first time using Amazon and it was great. I have bought other things over the net but by far this was the most seamless. Lets do it again next time.
Horrible. Must go through hell to return it too, they won't give you back the shipping to send it to you, just the cost of the item. Do not buy. Do not recommend	0

i had a good experience with 80s purple last year, so when i needed prop glasses i knew where to look. i got my order, the glasses were scratched and the frames were damaged. i called and they said they would send me a replacement right away, i was quite pleased. it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received them, i have called and emailed them several times with no response. not even picking up the phone. i plan on contesting the charges on my card and will not be shopping here any mor	0

Order placed by 7th of July didn't arrived by now.
I purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet.  I have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain.
No sunglasses... No money... No response from the seller...

The most awfull seller I have ever co-operated with....
These boots fit very well, look great, and I can wear them longer than any shoe I have had in the past year!!  I love them	1
I wish I would not ordered this nice glasses from this dishonourable seller....
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and look good. The price is a bit steep, I think, but considering I could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them, I guess they are worth it. Definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown!	1
Think twice before placing an order & paying money..	0
I ordered 3 products from Dance Now...None of them fit being at least one size too small. When I contacted Dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for Women. Men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size. I found no reference to that detail on the Amazon website. Dance Now representative told me it is referenced on their own website. But Amazon does not make that fact known.
This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole	0

I could not believe the quality in these shoes...HORRIBLE!
So now I have 2 orders I have to pay shipping to Dance Now as well as their exhchange cost. I am a bit unhappy over this	1
The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper. They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable. I bought chinese shoes in china town for $2, they were wonderfully comfortable, still smelled funny, but they were awesome.these are not!
These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG! I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. BEWARE	1

I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They're well made and super comfortable. He liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color. Highly recommended	1
IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR.
I bought these for my son, and he says they are really comfortable; he wears them when he plays basketball--lots of support and no blisters.  I'll most likely buy another pair for him..	1
MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
I love this bra!  It is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said, adds a whole cup size!  Cheaper than Victoria's Secret and well made	1
SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT	0
BEWARE:  This bra WILL increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more!  The only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something's up.
Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product.  I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging	0

The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them	0
This bra is made from good materials.  The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy.  The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that. 
How lame... 30 days later, no shipment, no delivery.


The only problem I have, is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup!  I prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a "push-up" design.


Very disgusted.
Otherwise, it's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results	1

these shoes are so cute and sexy! High heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner!
Information about shipment       
Beware though, if you've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online. I wear 8's in EVERYTHING but these, i wear 7.5. LOVE THEM!	1
 
These socks are absolutely the best. I take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat. (Not good in the middle of a side plank!)Anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry. One note; make sure not to order them big, the idea is that they should be snug	1
Ship Method: USPS 
I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way. 
Tracking Number: 910

Status: In transit 
I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable. 
  Order #: 103

Shipment Date: Jul 17, 2005 
Oh well.  The "concept" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job	1
Destination: West Hollywood, CA, United States 
I brought a pair of the Beach/Garden Clogs from Cozee World,  the order was shipped quickly,  and when I realized the size was wrong,  they even allowe dme to exchange them for the correct size.  It was Overall good service.  thanks	1
Estimated Arrival: Jul 26, 2005 
I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on	1

I just recieved my shoes today and can't believe that these shoes fit perfectly. The wide size 8.5 is just what I needed. I am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as I would often have with other shoes. I love the value as I purchased these for only $19.79.

The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.	1
 
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie	1
 
I love this umbrella. It's just the right size and works perfectly. It's so pretty that I don't want to get it wet!!	1

These were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities. He thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers.  They are a great value	1
I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies!
I love these underwear. I have not bought them from amazon yet, but I plan to. I will wear them until Jockey stops making them. I have worn these for the past 3 years, or so, and they are so soft and comfortable. Highly recommended	1

Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service	1
On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future	0
It's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes.  The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins, so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured.  However, for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart. 	1
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this	0
Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind! It takes a while to break it in but after, you will enjoy it! It looks so cool just looking at it, never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! And it WILL last a life time! Not water proof, but great for jungle trekking! Shines easy	1
The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands	0
I bought this for my wife as a "throw in" with more expensive items because it was so cheap.I actualy forgot I even ordered it until it came in. I was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me. Unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture. She is a size small and it fit perfect. This not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me. The only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up	1
We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product	0
This is an amazing product. I bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature. believe me, there is no comparison. not only is the Halo product made better, and is more durable and holds the baby better, but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too. I trust this company because the product is recommended by the SIDS society. I don't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle, because he is so secure in it.	1
When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one	0
These shoes are great!  My daughter tried to talk me into giving them to her.  Quick Delivery.  Good Quality	1
I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long	0
Great delivery & of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b/c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up !	1
You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. "You get what you pay for" applies to this product	0
Just got them in the mail today. As other kenneth cole reaction shoes, it runs one size larger. I'm usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right. These boots look great with jeans. The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph.	1
These socks were thin, large, and horrible.  They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently.  Absolutely worthless	0
I had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before I left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party. My hubby couldn't believe I'd wear something like this, but boy oh boy, he didn't object. He couldn't take his eyes off my, well you can just imagine what it was he couldn't take his eyes off of	1
I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator. Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder.	0
I purchased one of these cases for my sister-in-law, and she liked it so much, that I bought one for me too.  I really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their DS Lite.
Illuminator is shown in ad, but a generic brand was shipped to me.  The light wasn't as bright and it wasn't made very well.The crank was cheaply made, and the button that you press didn't work every time. 	0

I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price	0
The vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations.  I would purchase from them again without hesitation	1
This product was disappointing.  Not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected.  I guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit	0
This bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike.  The cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes, but not so large everything gets lost inside	1
I wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe.  Should not happen at nearly $6 a pair and a logo of GOLD TOE	0
these are so great, and keep my baby's feet warm.  She even slept with them on with no problem.  She's been a master at getting her socks off up until now.  They also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails.  She's chewing on the toes but I haven't seen any scuff marks yet, so they are holding up very well	1
These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks. They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe. Not only does the seam press into the toe, but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself. Terrible product	0
robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2	1
I was very disappointed with this bra.  I would definately not recommend it.  If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead.
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.	1

Swimsuit very cute - size as stated (16 = 20/22)  Bra did not have enough support for me so I wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well.  I love it	1
This bra looks sexy, but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra (at least not for a size 38DD)	0
i love these shoes, they are totally cute. the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper. they aren't as soft as i thought they would be, but i great buy none the less. 	1
this listing isen't correct.
I just love different and odd things. I love to give people gifts that no one else have.Thanks	1
item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt, not a t-shirt	0
I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST	1
I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you	0
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.	1
Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience	0
I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security	1
This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.  I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper. 	0
Pros:
I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY 	0
Ultra Fast delivery w/package tracking. Item was shipped within a few hours of order. Suit is in great condition and I like the color.
This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through	0
Cons:
When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped. 
When they say grab bag...that means the suit may or may not look like the picture. Mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer...which is cool with me cause I actually wanted a blue jammer. Just be prepared	1

Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price	1
The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.
This is the only shoe I wear for High Impact Jazzercise classes four+ times per week.  I have a wide, flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly.  And with boot cut jazz pants, they look great! 	1

A very cool product, it got me a lot of attention on 3/22/07 at the OU student Union. At first, it was hard to work. but now, I can even spin!!!
The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.
I always wear them to my mom's office	1

These are hands down my favorite pair of jeans. I'm 5'5" and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels.  The stretch fabric hugs in all the right places, and the cut is slimming. 	1
Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.
well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them.

When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.
If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no furthe	1

I LOVE my soft and comfortable green robe that I received last year for Mother's Day! Whenever I wear it, I want to just relax with a magazine or watch TV, and then fall asleep in it. The matching green slippers complete the feel, and I really feel pampered. I never knew I could feel SO good wearing a robe, especially since I was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe! This is such an excellent product and great gift!	1
My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks.  I haven't seen them online, but this is worth a trip to the store	0
I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)  
I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the "delicate" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's	0
I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else.	1
This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up	0
This is the absolute best sport bra made. I have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once I discovered this particular model I have never switched back. The Champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it's shape. Unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale	1
I thought I was on the same page as crocs when I ordered the PWClog.  It confusing...I thought I was ordering a sale on Crocs.
These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy	1

I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.
They are not Crocs..	0

i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke.i love the way they look but not the quality of them.i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them	0
I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.
Why? I do not know. But be more carefully anbout it	0

For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue.  Very dark.  Also, the sizes run big.  Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned	0
My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter). 
Although very cute, Crocs are not good shoes.  They are a cheap, plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all.  I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are "non slip".  She did slip in them, many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet.  They are the right size but I just think they are not made well.


Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)	1
Don't go for the hype. They are a useless shoe.	0
We bought this for our 13 month old for Christmas and she loves it. It is extremely soft. Her favorite part is the cell phone that rings. The compact also squeaks. I love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it. This is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl	1
first of all, they dont even go up TO the thigh!  they attempt to sit right above the knee!!
These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.	1

These shoes are durable, comfortable, and most importantly come in different widths.  Most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but D width.  New Balance does.
second, THEY DO NOT STAY UP AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!! I was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds I was pulling them back up.....


For those of you complaining about width, my guess is that if you size your feet correctly, that problem will go away.  I had always worn a 12D width, until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life I found out I need a 13B. You may think you know your feet, but you may not.
I am 5'3" and I weigh about 125....I'm average - these are a joke - price IS too good to be true - DO NOT BU	0

I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.  
As to comfort, I can't complain.  As to durability, maybe they are a little stiffer, but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others, that is well worth it in my book	1
  Very cheezy item.
This is a fabulous find! My husband loves henley shirts...but, they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length. After many failed attempts, I finally found the perfect shirt. Great look, great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too	1

Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .Do reccomend	1
Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes	0
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets	1
My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket. 	0
The zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue . It is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence, etc. slipping out, making identity  theft a serious possibilty.
Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit	0

I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.
 The zipper wallet avoids this from happening. Ironicly, this item is not available at local stores.I encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday world

I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and "break them in" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years	0

First of all they didn't sent me the pictured panties, but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print. Butt-ugly. Second, they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse. Returned right away. Very disappointing	0
I bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them!  They fit great, they arrived in great condition and very quickly.  The rhinestones are really blingy in the sun!  I am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also.  Very cute for the price	1
Not very good pictures or description.Wallet was smaller than I expected.Quality was OK,not competitively priced	0
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone	1
So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again	0
I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son. We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole, but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction. They are excellent shoes and he loves them. He won't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments	1
I can't say much for the shoes, but Amazon goofed up on this one.  They shipped out an empty box.  Luckily UPS caught it and sent notice to Amazon for me. 	0
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!	1
Seller will not honor prices listed...then if you leave seller negative feedaback..AMAZON WILL REMOVE IT!!! Do not trust seller ratings..they are false!!!!	0
These shoes are stunning, original and over-the-top beautiful. I just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? Square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything, but "mosquito hunters". They have a perfect narrow shape, with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000. Trust me, with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front. I'm picking up the black ones as I'm writing this. Enjoy them....I know you as well as your better half will!	1
Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing	0
Good color visibility; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan North.
We have not opened the package. The item is advertised as one size. Without a notice that the one size is not "One Size fits all" It is XL (Grand Plus for those that speak french). My wife wears a size 2 or 4. Obviously this was a waste of money	0
The hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again. 
This hoodie is very poorly made. I bought a blue version and I had to return it after washing it in COLD water on GENTLE. It faded substantially, changed shape, and the threading came loose. Not recommended!!	0
I have ordered Maroon but will likely add some other color choice, as the array is rather impressive. For an 100 % acrylic knit, this is not a bad hat; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily, almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine.	1
These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.	0
They shipped these almost overnight. My daughter was a perfect little flower girl; No trips, no blisters, and they've held up great over the past 9-10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play. She was a size 10 at the time of the wedding, but the shoes were a 9? Her feet were fine. She can still squeeze into them now, and she's an 11. Very pleased. Good value. These are the exact shoes	1
It won't help you get dry, it's more of a robe to hang out. I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund	0
Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..	1
These bras do not hold up very well. I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away - six months later	0
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it	1
I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.
The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material. However, I ordered the extra large, and they were very small for that size.  It seemed as though the XL was more a Med/Large.  I would also think that "lounge pants" or "PJ bottoms" would be a bit bigger as you wouldn't want these types of pants too tight.  They were a gift, so I just hope they don't shrink after washing! 	1
I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again	0
These are the best windproof liner gloves out there.  I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said "made with Gore Windstopper" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. 
I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH	0

These broke within the first 3 days of use. 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
These are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  
On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days.	0

OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow	0
The only "downside" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. 
The picture of the shoes was deceiving.  Did not want ankle strap.  You could not

go by the picture.  Which is how you do online shopping. Returned the shoes.	0
I wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens. 
Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs	0

The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough	0
These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years. 
These boots look very nice, but unfortunately, it is way too narrow (and I have narrow feet).  My whole foot felt squashed.  Back to Amazon it goes	0

This shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot	0
I can't recommend these enough.  
These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though	0

I wear a lot of Rockport shoes. Almost exclusively. I was very disappointed in these shoes. They are the same "size" as all of the other Rockports I have, yet they are too small	0
-Scott	1
Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit. 	0
This is such a wonderful pair of gloves. They are light and easily portable. They can be folded and stored in one's pockets. They have features that enable use of one's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs. The synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather (especially wind and rain). I am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone's elses	1
Not comfortable.  The "thong" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable	0
These are hot, Hot, HOT!  Will be buying them in other colors.  My guy went NUTS	1
When the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing.  I called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece. I would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces	0
  The product is in good condition when it was shipped. The quality is good. Thank you.	1
I wish I could give them -5 stars.
I bought these for my husband.  He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm.  He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself !	1
I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $170 should be really good. I couldn't be more wrong. The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day!!! Stay away at all cost	0
I purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift... And I wish I would have purchased one for myself as well! This robe is made of the softest, warmest materials, but is extremely light-weight, unlike most robes. "Luxurious" is the perfect adjective.	1
i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it, i was disappointed. the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse. also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me	0
These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too	1
The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  
I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.  


Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety	0
Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable	1
Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.  If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect.	0
Most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers, or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies.
I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991	0

I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2  	0
This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today.  It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.
I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe	0

Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed	0
My first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.
this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought, my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it's SUPER tight on her.... this was very disappointing to say the least.... if you normally wear a small in other things, I would suggest you buy the extra large in this. The quality of the material is GREAT that's what made me even give this product a 2..	0

I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  
If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color	1

the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got, after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80's Purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge. i was blown away	1
I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all	0
This was just what I was looking for and couldn't find in local
I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!	0
retail stores.  Fits perfectly in my wallet and now my credit
I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra.  This bra fits horribly.  Do not buy if you are DD/E cup!  This bra is uncomfortable and doesn't hold your goods properly	0
cards don't fall on the ground in stores!  Reasonable price also.
While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging	0
Excellent product	1
OUT OF STYLE!
I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no "break in" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven	1

.....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that	1
All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans. They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style.
This merchant really delivers with this item - In the stores, this is almost twice the price.  I really wasn't expecting such quality from this item (Yes, it's Crushed Velvet, so not warm, but warm wasn't the goal). Would definitely recommend this item, and may buy another color for myself	1

At first I had my heart set on a different cloak, but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one. I am very pleased that I was not disappointed. This cloak looks and feels beautiful. It has a nice button closure at the neck, and for those that are petite it is floor length. This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume. It is very comfortable and soft, no itchy feel here	1
The fit, quality, durability, and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago. There is definitely a noticeable difference, and not a positive one.
I bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them... however I recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of Mt. Everest, ouch	1

This item arrived on time and the quality was great. This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for "baby" - it's just how I expected it would be	1
The price far exceeds the value - OVERPRICED!	0
I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.	1
These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.  	0
This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first	1
This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap.  When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off.  When I emailed Alys's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this bra	0
This belt is seriously great.  I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later, exactly as the seller described.  I'm not sure what the previous review was all about, but my belt is great.  I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it	1
I really wanted this product to work, but it really didn't help with my problem. I always have erect nipples no matter what and this really doesn't fully flatten them, or make them less noticeable with t-shirts, etc	0
These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought "thongs are not for "real men" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong	1
I was so disappointed in these. I am full-busted (38DD) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time.  I used a band-aid and it did a better job.  These provided no help at all. AND they REALLY HURT taking them off	0
I Just want to make something clear...the windbreaker is NOT Prada, the tag reads MIU MIU, a very good brand, but definetely not Prada.  I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket.  I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect... 	1
These didn't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much. They do have great adhesive. Also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola, because they are pretty small. I used every pair, just thinking I was putting them on poorly, but everytime, I was a pokin	0
Got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe.  She loves it - nice & warm, pretty pink color.  They run small-she usually takes a medium -got her a large.  She could have used an XL.  Sleeves are a bit short.  She likes the look & the zip front	1
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!	1
I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again	0
I have been searching for the perfect ped sock, not too thick, not so thin it slides off your heel and, most importantly, COTTON.  My search is over.  This is by far the best sock ever.  Great with sneakers AND closed in shoes.	1
it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces. 
Yes beautiful people I too own this shoe and it is fun and sexy.  I didn't think at my age I could wear such a high wedge heel however, I was wrong and thankful to be so.  This is a fun shoe which looks great on.  I have it in the gold and I love wearing them out and about	1
look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good	0
Great price - aprons are perfect for my mom.  She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job.  The Company sent them out right away; would order again. Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from.  I order two packages, with 3 in each package	1
I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again. 	0
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!	1
I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!?	0
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it	1
I was givin this case for christmas and I thought it was great for the first month...................then I took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen.  I am a total scratch freak but still I was really mad.  WARNING: if YOU don't like your iPod scratched DO NOT get this case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
To echo another reviewer:
I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.  
I am a heavy runner with high (semi-flexible) arches and a neutral stride, running 20-35 miles per week. Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length, pronation,and heal-to-toe gait, I tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe.

I am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos (the shoe designed for the "clydesdale type" runner), a pair of Adidas Adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly), and some various pairs of New Balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the Mizuno Wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling, durable, light-weight, cushioned (without being bulky) shoe I have ever owned. I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7's and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). That and the Mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference.  
If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!	0

the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.	0
I would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues.	1
I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock	0
This is an excellent bra.  In addition to being sexy, it is also quite functional.  It defines one's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support.  This particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black.  
These were not as expected, there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels, there was just an open hole. He has problems using these too!	0

This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again	0
Chantelle bras are made according to French standards.  You get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long.  Still, it's an excellent bra	1
The jacket we received had weird arms, they had a hole for the thumb, and then another for the rest of the fingers. Great for skiing or snowboarding, but for casual use in Florida winter wasn't very practical. Columbia in general is a company I swear by	0
For years, I wore Asics. The GT, the Cumulus, the Nimbus. But I have to say, if you're fan of any Asics shoes named after clouds, you should try the Trigon 4. Very similar, but cheaper. Also they did not joke when they called it the Ride. It has a very smooth transition and insane cushion, but a little more support than Asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight. A big thumbs (toes?) up	1
I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.  I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle	0
I have had a pair of these for several years; they were an incredibly lucky find. They're *extremely* comfortable, better than many pairs of sneakers I've tried on. They've worn very well, and I'd say they're well made: I've only had to replace the shoelaces once. A bit of polish, some Kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water, and they're perfect. Trust me, you can walk for miles in them, and they look great, I think. A great purchase. If you're looking for a pair of dress shoes, and nervous about buying them without trying them on, well... my feet love them. Don't know how far that will carry yours, but there's my two cents. Excellent	1
I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut	0
I was very, very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat.  It fit perfectly and was ahit with Mom and Dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months.  I found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you can't do better on this buy	1
The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors. 	0
This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch. 
These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.
Not a summer coat too heavy!!! The next model needs to have pit zips!	1

I have several jackets. They are well made, warm and I wouldn't wear any other. Long lasting and look good with anything	1
I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize	0
These shoes are adorable and perfect for summer!! I love mine!!
As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11" by 8.5" by 6.5", the one I've got is surely not that big (10"x8"x4" at best!), and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it (and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise, was it what they were aiming for?). The material is ok, so is the craftsmanship, but the fact that they  lied (yes! l-i-e-d!) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal. A great dissapointment!!! :	0

i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped	0
The only negative thing is that they are wide. I have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size. They fit length wise but are very spacey width wise	1
i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips!	0
These boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest. I was pleasantly surprised. I was trying to replace a pair I had accidentally washed in the washing machine (a no-no with this fabric). Turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what I had originally purchased. I will probably be purchasing more. 
I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?	0
Your wife will thank you for buying these. Excellent quality, and softer than satin. My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes, because it's made without a fastener. The idea is for a sleeker feel, but it sacrifices security. Love 'em anyway	1
The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a "T" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody	0
This is really a great item, very comfortable.  I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose.  Great for the intended purpose though	1
I love Vanity Fair. Their bras just fit me perfectly. When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair. Not only that, but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material. I tried it on in hopes it may fit. It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on. Not because of size. It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, "Made in Hong Kong.	0
Minimzer is correct, I bought this bra in a 38DDD and it made me look more like a D or DD. It lifted and minim1zed my breasts. My only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point. If you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you.	1
The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order.  Amazon had said they would rectify the error, although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle, and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties, and a different strap entirely	0
These are the coolest things ever made. I have been searching for a product like this forever and I could only find what used to be called &quot;lingerie helpers&quot; from the 50's or 60's (I think) which didn't quite do the job.  No more buying those &quot;speciality&quot; bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn't quite fit right. I just put these on my favorite bra and don't even know it is there.  Now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts. I am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and I am not!!!	1
First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product	0
These are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price.  I wear a Large in most shirts and the Large size for these fits snug, especially after a wash, which is how I like it for wearing as an undershirt.  If you're buying for outerwear, you might consider going a size larger. Shipping wasn't 'Amazon Quick' but it was reasonable - about a week if I remember right	1
The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad	0
The slippers are great; comfortable and good quality. Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago. Buying them online was so convenient	1
I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.	0
I absolutely love this suit, my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down	1
I was disappointed with the shoes when I received them.  On the website, the shoes looked Gold in color and were described as Gold, but when I received the shoes they were beige.  I am sorry to say that I could not wear the shoes.  	0
Very comfortable and sexy. Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace	1
These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans	0
This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a "traditional" Speedo suit	1
I got two problems with this here lingeree:
I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32. The bathing suit was too tight. I'll get in on size 34 next time	1
1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label "Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear."
I do roofing work & work outside on the hotest days. I had problems with heat rash & jock itch. My boss suggested I wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew. I asked around & picked up some HANES all cotton boxes. WOW - what a difference -- they feel great. No binding when I work - the cotton does give a bit as you wear them. Now they are the only underwear I will wear. They do shrink a bit after washing - so do get a size up 	1
2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..	0
THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON.
My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit	0
WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS, AND NO ONE HERE, AT THE TIME, HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND) TRYING TO FIND KB'S 24.
I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!! The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places. I mean, the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies! I even bought them a size larger, because some brands tend to fit a little snug	0
 
i ordered this product from general_discounters and I have tried for 4 wks. and still I have not gotten a response from them and I havent received my order. As far as the actual cologne, it is nice but order it from that company and you'll not get to smell it because you wont get it. All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller	0
I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, NO SURPRISES.  MY SON LOVES IT!
I am not happy with what I got in the mail today. I thought I was getting a real used fencing foil. Instead, I got a kids plastic fencing sword!



Sending it back ASAP to get my account credited for sure!
	1

A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified	1
Why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil	0
These boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look. The fit is right on and they are very warm and dry. i love them! They are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into. Highly recommended	1
I bought this item because it said "optional belt clip."  The belt clip is only "optional" if you "opt" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot "opt" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip "optional."  I would call it "will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it," which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in	0
I only use the protective case/skin, not the armband or belt clip.  I primarily wanted protection for the screen, which this provides.  The screen protector and skin fit perfectly and were easy to apply.  I can easily access all ports and manipulate all controls with them applied/installed.  I have not used the armband, but it looks pretty sturdy.  I paid $18.90 for this item including $5.95 shipping	1
I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads. 	0
I bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so I decided to buy a pair for myself. I wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable--i think wearing socks w/ these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet.	1
I ordered 5 of these belt buckles. The company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they didn't actually have this belt. I needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it wasn't in stock I could have ordered it elsewhere	0
My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected!  It securely fastens to my running shoe; holds my key, emergency cash, and identification; and most importantly, serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor.  Best of all, my iPod works efficiently and accurately in the Shoe Wallet without my purchasing Nike-branded shoes.
These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.	0
I'm a very happy consumer!	1
I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable.  Other than that they are OK, but because of this I mostly wear these inside out	0
This is a fine leather bag, beautiful, comfortable! 
Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs.  The Elance is poorly made and designed, Jockey is barely evern trying.  Look on the web guys, there are better choices.... Jockey's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame	0
I bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping. Its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship!
I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..	0
A must have	1
Like a permanent wedgie, these kept riding up my crack.  I don't recommend these at all...the liquid metallic look is only useful if you're going to be a male stripper.  Otherwise, you've got liquid metal up your crack...not very appealing	0
Everyone loved me in these glasses for our "Old Fashioned Banquet"!  They completed my outfit, great price and a speedy delivery - which I really needed	1
You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them. 	0
GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE, WELL REALLY FOR ME.AND BOY OH BOY DID
I agree.  Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy	0
I ENJOY SEEING HER WALK AROUND THE HOUSE IN THIS ALL WEEKEND..
the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure	0
THANKS AMAZON	1
I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head	0
Very comfortable and durable.  I would wear these outside - although not for a long walk, but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt.  I recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper	1
This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back	0
I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005. I got the Pine green, a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort. I am ordering another pair in Charcoal, as I want 2 pairs to have at both places I live. It's all about comfort for me when I am home, so these fit the bill. Good value as well	1
I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. 
THESE ARE THE SOFTEST - MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS!   YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER	1

Our son love this pair of shoes, he wears it to church or just to a party. He said that they are nice and comfy he can run with them because the have rubber soles. WE think that they are elegant as well. WE give 5 stars for them!! Very Good	1
All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort	0
We ordered this product, and paid for expedited shipping.  8 days later, it had not arrived.  Their explanation was that it was 2 day shipping from the day of shipping, but it still took 3 days to get around to shipping.  The backpack missed the giftee, and it had to be shipped again to catch up to her	1
These slippers are anything but comfortable. Besides the sizing being to small, I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid's slipper. The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone's foot, and the inside material is also anything but comfortable.	0
I buy these shoes in bulk as they are so good.  I have high arches and these shoes are the only ones that have never given me any trouble.  I am now on my 3rd pair and use them for my marathon training and running	1
It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT	0
My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  
There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.	0

This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it	0
I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!
I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game	0

This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite	0
I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  
Until today, 01/09/2007, I did not yet receive item Hi-Cut Brief 7_8701_1176 XL/Light Beige


I strongly recommend this product	1

I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty "spillover" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last	1

Although I prefer Jockey, these Hanes Bikini Briefs are great and I plan to order more. Great value. I also bought Fruit of the Loom but in my opinion the Hanes have a much nicer fuller cut, The Fruit of the Loom are for youngsters with tiny butts. The reason I didn't buy Jockey is they're too expensive	1
both purchased on 11/30/200	0
Im in the military and run quite abit about 20 miles or more a week Ive had these shoes for a while now and I have to say they are the best Ive ever had as far as comfort and durabilty. My current pair is about worn out and I plan to purchase a new pair of the sam	1
the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it	0
I purchased this bag to take on a tour of Greece and was pretty happy with it.  I loved the size, not to big and not too small, and also the flatness of it.  It was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible.  The only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body, the strap tends to rub at the neck, so  I had to keep adjusting it every five minutes.  Overall it was pretty good, though	1
I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).	0
I have owned and worn this for several months now, and it is very durable AND warm as well! I would just be cautious about the unisex sizing, as I am a Medium sized person (10-12) and it does seem to be a little large, yet I wear it anyways.  Hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	1
I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P.O. Box but the seller used UPS which won't send packages to P.O. Boxes so I gave an alternate address. I've never recieved the scrubs for my friend. I've sent e-mails inquiring about my order and haven't recieved any word back. I've been cheated out of my money.	0
Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.  Kids don't notice, and neither do most adults.  Worth picking up, great price	1
These "cover ups" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun.  The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps.  They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for.  I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item. 	0
These boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts. Because they are real leather, I was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable - but it only took a few wearings before I could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet. Didn't have any problem with them fitting my calves. I had that problem with other boots I have tried before. Even if you don't consider the great price for all leather boots, they are wonderful buy	1
I was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i didn't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering, it SHOULD be the same thing you're looking physically the thing you're gonna buy!!!
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon	1
i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIPS.
awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet	1
its very easy to put a picture of the product!!
Great fit, lightweight. These are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement. Support strap is not too tight which is good, and actually serves a purpose	1

Let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes..........DO IT! They are not only beautiful but as high as they are, they are extremely comfortable. The detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website. My favorite shoe of the summer	1
regard	0
These socks are just what I was looking for, a thin cotton blend to wear running.  No bunching and they breath very well.  The price and timliness of the order was also great	1
just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them. 	0
I'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands.  These shoes surpassed others in fit, support, and comfort.  I'm so glad Kayano comes in wide sizes, because it fits my feet PERFECTLY!  I highly recommend!   	1
Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust. This made me look awkward and did not fit well. Don't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did.	0
Have always been pleased with this manufactures product. The company I purchased from was fair priced and very efficient	1
Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18.  The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother	0
Munsingwear is definitely the most comfortable, best fitting men's brief I have ever worn	1
The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
These were really easy for my little girl to put on herself. They were well make and very light weight. I like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky	1
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit	0
I picked this sucker up for $30 from Fred Meyer, after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my iPod from my computer (I was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery). I was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation, but I've been using it ever since.
First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description	0

I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.  	0
I keep the car charger in my car, with no extra cables to burden it, and I keep the wall charger plugged into the wall. The cable retracts easily, with a design much like that of a window blind (pull until you let go, where it locks, and then pull a bit more and let go to release).
Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality	0

I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas. I can't return them  because he wore them for a day. These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers. The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left. Don't waste your money	0
It's a small, unobtrusive, and incredibly convenient device for your iPod, and at this price, it's a steal. You'd pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone, let alone one that is so solidly constructed.
If your loved one is a beautiful 5'7", 130 lb slender lady like mine, forget about this piece of clothing. If, however, she is a 5'1" 180 lb gorgeous "petite" girl, this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for. You'll have lots of fun, first trying to put it on her, then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places, and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself.


No question -- if you own an iPod, purchase this product. I was impressed enough to come and write this review -- perhaps you will be too	1
Fun that will come after that is purely optional..	0
I really like the Speedo suit.  I wear two swim suits, the Speedo and a larger "drag" suit over it.  I've done this since my days on the swim team.  The chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time, causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually.  Having the Speedo prevents any embarrassing moments.  The fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement I've needed in years.  
These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely. Do not buy them.	0

The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals.  I have had these sandals before and this didn't happen.  Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower, and thus more fragile, nubs.  All I know is, they are junk	0
If you are husky, this might be a tight fit.  I wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side. 	1
I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again	0
Well constructed blazer. Great color. You can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church.	1
The scarf itched my neck, smelled funny and was not the color of ivory. It was beige. It is not cashmere. It would not itch if it were cashmere	0
LOVE,LOVE,LOVE Gerber products and these are no exception. Great quality and they are so soft. The only thing is that the 0-3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3-6	1
I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.  On the picture it looks more blue than purple	0
When I saw in a magazine that Croc was making a style of their shoes that was NOT UGLY, I literally went the same day to Dillard's to get a pair for myself! They are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you're standing on clouds!
Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice.


The Amazon listing doesn't show all the colors that they come in: light pink, silver, gold, celery, lavender, light blue, white, black and fuschia. All the colors are really adorable, and I had a hard time deciding!
Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again.


I have also had issues with sizing, just as other reviewers have had. I usually wear a 7.5 Wide in women's shoes, but when I tried on the Primas in an 8, they were ridiculously big, and when i tried them on in a 7, they were a tad too snug. I really wish they made half sizes. I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toasty warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!
On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly	0

These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	0
Grade: A-	1
Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting.	0
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow	1
I purchased this skin to accompany my daughter's new mp3 player.  We managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful, or so we thought.  I expected higher durablity	0
Great service.  The shoes were just what I wanted.  I highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable	1
I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.
This set is guaranteed to make your partner stop and take notice!  Plus, you will enjoy wearing this silky, sensuous set to liven up your evening.  The fit is fantastic.  Not much is left to the imagination	1

Plugged into Ipod and guess what! Audio and video came out the other end! A little spendy but what can ya do	1
The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric.	0
These boots are GORGEOUS! I got such an awesome deal on these boots; I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! I'll put one up here. They're comfy, rich leather, well made. I've always wanted Frye boots	1
Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me	0
These are, by far, the most comfortable boots I have ever owned! I am a huge fan of Dansko clogs, and these Frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy! They run a bit on the large side, about a half size difference. You will love them!!!!	1
The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement. 	0
I just got these and love them.  My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes.  The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer.  If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice	1
These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk	0
The socks were nice but cost too much .  Price a little unreasonable	1
I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of "wool-blend".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these	0
Calvin Klein provides a fashionable, comfortable underwear. Tight but not too tight, it holds you in place, while not constricting you to a tight position. Excellent, but don't buy them too little	1
In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make	0
These trunks are great.  The pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable.  I drive alot, and these are by far the best underwear I have ever had.
she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all	0
Just be sure to order one size larger than you usually wear, otherwise they will be skin tight (unless you want that)	1
I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!	0
This mask attached using some Velcro in the rear. 
apparently there is an error in the item description. these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive. I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway... stupid me.	0

I would not buy this product again.  It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end	0
I love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet!
The item is not my concern; I still have not even received it	0

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  
At first I had some problems with my glasses fogging up, what I did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks. This drastically reduced fogging. I read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging (on a similar product)


The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 
Overall this has been a great buy.


I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  
Nic	1

This bra fits very well (I found it fit very true to size) and offers great support.  I'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices I've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support.  It has held up well while jogging. 	1
The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  
Very smooth transaction and timely delivery.  First time on-line shoe buyer.  I tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them.  I saved about 35% by purchasing here!	1

This is the best sports bra I've ever had!  I show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that, as I gaited the dog around the ring, I was bouncing!  Now, no more bounce and extreme comfort.  I've had the bras for over 6 months now and they've held up well.  Everyone that I've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences	1
Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.
This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!


I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.
I have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. 


I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. 	0
When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. 
VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle	0

I ORDERED A LARGE AND ASSUMED IT WAS ADULT SIZE...THIS LARGE WAS LIKE A GIRLS SIZE LARGE....VERY SMALL SIZING  I RETURNED THE SWEATER..	0
I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!
I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all	0

I am so disappointed.  Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size	0
I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...
Don't buy these.  I used to love Florsheim (I still wear an old pair of Comfortech's) but I got a bad pair of these	0

This visor is square in shape instead of oval, I have never seen a square visor before. It looks very strange.  Also, it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be, it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head.  I will not be wearing mine	0
PROS
I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn't get it on and I don't have a narrow foot	0
------
I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house	0
1) Attaches securely
The foam padding does not have enough consistancy. It stays compressed with in a short period of time. 
2) Removes with VERY little or no pain
Not recommended	0
3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. 
Ordered large, got "youth large", too small. Threw out receipt before checking. My bad. wife now wears T-shirt to work out in	0
4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)
Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra	0
5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. 
Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine	0
6) Washable and reusable
Sorry, there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months...runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer.  Can be seen straight through	0
7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. 
My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service	0
8) When properly applied you will not leak
I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them. 	0
9) Peace of mind 
I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as 
10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. 
on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back.	0

The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all. 	0
CONS
This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item	0
-------
I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me. Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.There was no way to repair them. These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these. Really cheap. I am very unhappy. =( 	0
1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.
Well i am a big sunglass fan. i just love them so i was excited to get these. they seemed very cute. well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses. this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again	0
2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort
Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable	0
3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.
I bought these socks to wear for work.  They didn't even last one day.  By the end of the first day, there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal.  By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels.  I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.
4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. 


The next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.
As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!

I regained my sanity after getting these. Sooooo much nicer than disposables	1
	0
Ditto... I bought more of these.
.............they sent me the wrong size...and didn't leave clear returning guidelines. You are better off getting something cheaper, because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck	0

This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide.  They run small.  They look nicer in the picture than they actually are	0
Love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts... really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething. I bought these for a very low price that couldn't be beat. Nice quality	1
I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(	0
This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List	1
This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now	0
I received the earmuffs I ordered 3 days after I placed the order	1
Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues.	0
The earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter	1
This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good. 	0
Our son was very pleased to get a leather jacket for Christmas. The proof is in the wearing!  He's been wearing it ever since.  Thanks for the great transaction! 	1
I did not like this product at all. It is very hard to use and  too small	0
I love these boots! I got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect. I can fit pants in them or over them and I have not had a problem yet	1
1. Packaging was shabby.
HESITANTLY, I ORDERED MY FIRST PAIR OF FOLK READERS; NOW I'M BACK FOR A SECOND PAIR. THEY'RE COMFORTABLE, UNIQUE, WELL-CRAFTED AND THE COMPANY OFFERS EXCELLENT SERVICE - A WINNER	1
2. The finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out.
This is a one of a kind handbag.  Great on a night out or just for kicks!  Unbeatable price for such a genuine item.  
3. The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen.
Don't have one?
4. DONT be deceived by the pictures.
Get One!
5. The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25% of the actual cost	0

A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother	0
I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality. 	1
I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra	0
I've been looking for black sport socks for a long time!  Finally, a black comfortable, cushy sport sock of medium thickness.  I'm completely satisfied	1
Are customers to guess what is a "small" size compared to a "large size?" Is the small for a todder, pre-schooler or teenager? What a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes. 	0
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again	1
Cannot order these as they do not say what small, medium or large=....I have a 6 year olde and is 60#'s so do I buy a medium or a large...I hate this when I want  something and there is not enough information..	0
I am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . Very Pleased	1
Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.	0
I bought this for my daughter.  She is into pink and camo???   Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it.  What more is there to say	1
I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..	0
Tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30F to +40F with regular Dockers and long-sleeve cotton/polyester shirt.  They are lighter and less bulky than their all-cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures.  They also dry much more quickly.
In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware	0

This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....	0
As with all longjohns I have found on the market in the past forty-plus years, the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6'(now) or 6'2" (back then).  Sadly, I never see them listed in "Tall Sizes," and, as always before, I have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over...to make sure my waist is protected. 	1
Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back.
I love the sweatshirt! It came exactly as pictured and in time for me to 

wear it for the Super Bowl	1
On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's	0
I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos, but they were out of stock, so I decided to go with the pickle color. I absolutely love em! The comfort and style are unique and satisfying. It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts	1
This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms	0
Seriously, went into the store to find new running shoes, possibly the air 360.  Was wearing shoxs in the store.  Threw them away immediately.  These are the best shoes I've worn in a long while.  I'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as I get home.  I forgot that these were on, they were that comfortable.  I'm a heavy, parttime runner.  Nothing over 5K as I am just starting again.  They support my weight extremely well	1
These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
Even if you could never see yourself wearing this. Go ahead and get it anyway.
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.
This is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. Feels good on your head. I have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too. keeps your head dry.
How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  :	0
I also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house	1
The item was not as pictured.  It is funky and of poor quality.  The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this	0
I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far	1
I love Nine West shoes, but these boots are not made like Nine West.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS. I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID. IT FITS PERFECTLY, AND ALREADY I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A TWENTY DEGREE DIFFERENCE WITH RAIN, AND BEING A GLASSES WEARER, I CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY PLEASED. I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON	1
It didn't help that when I received them they were damaged. I purchased 3 other pairs of Nine West shoes from Amazon and LOVE them but these boots stink!!	0
Tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable. The stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix. GOOD DEAL	1
For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.
I am so in love with these jeans. I made myself a promise that when I buy jeans again, these are definitely the brand jeans I will be purchasing!! I am very pleased with the L.E.I. jeans to the full extent!!	1
Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item.  I will never shop Amazon or any online store	0
The zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job, the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly, easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	1
I received my sunglasses last week, they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions. they have three lines on them, and simply I feel that I lost my money.  I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio	0
i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week	1
The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars	0
These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a "pouch", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it.
I have done a review on these socks already, which has not appeared.  They are not a good buy	0

This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	0
The briefs also run about a size small. I have a 31" waist but the mediums are too small.	1
I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off.
These shoes are so light that sometimes I forget I have them on. They are so  comfortable than I don't want to take them off. I have to walk a lot every day and I am not kidding when I said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use, but these shoes do the job to perfection. 

I highly recommend them	1
I recommend buying another model..	0
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to	1
I like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out. I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small. 34B fits in other brands so I know it's not because I've got bigger	0
I ordered this shirt hoping it matched 5 others I had bought at a store
These two packets of panties were too large.  I also didn't like the cotton.  Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it, but  I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn't like them.
for my wedding party. I called the company, they explained the shirt in detail. I ordered it and received it promptly, and it was a perfect match.

I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used.	0
I first saw this WebUndies outfit when my friend Sara brought them to our lingerie party and I have to admit, with all the other hot looking stuff there, I didn't have too much hope for these. Well, was I ever wrong. You don't need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man. These will do the trick. If your guy hasn't been paying you the kind of attention you've been wanting, get a pair of these, wear them to bed like pjs, climb under the covers, roll over pretend to go to sleep. I'm betting he won't let ya	1
Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.	0
I love these running shoes.  They have a great look and they feel great, too. They fit my feet perfectly	1
Ordered shoe in my usual size; shoe was too tight.  Bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge; so I returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase, but not for shipping both ways	0
I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised	1
The shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly.  Be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small.  Also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive	0
The Carhartt A110 Cold Weather Merino Wool Socks were a gift for my son.
I broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go. Once I got the keys on the holders the zipper broke. I threw it away, but had to scape up my nails again to get my keys off the holders	0
He has been very happy with them, keeping him very warm in the cold of Wyoming and Colorado.  I would definitely buy another pair for him and maybe for myself	1
Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended	0
Just received a pair of these Deer Stags from my father, really, never heard of them before.  They are the most comfortable "dress" shoe I have ever worn.  Good for around the office, on the factory floor or in the field.  Slip resistant too	1
This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS	0
The New Balance Men's M587 Running Shoe has been an excellent running shoe.  It has a built in rollbar that prevent shin-splints and the shoes are extremely comfortable to run-in.  I have been buying this shoe for over four years and two deployments to Iraq.  I recommend this shoe to any runner that runs 4-5 times a week. 	1
The corset looks so pretty... its a pretty material... It can hold you YES... it has a boning made of some crappy material... after wearing it I noticed something was poking Me... both ends the top and the bottom... well when I take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line. 
HAD TO SEND BACK THE FIRST PAIR BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIGGER SIZE. RECEIVED THE SECOND PAIR AND CREDIT FOR THE FIRST PAIR PROMPTLY. THIS PAIR IS JUST RIGHT!!! WILL DEFINATELY
It hurted so bad... so I tried to "snip" it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming... it totally sucks.. now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience	0
ORDER AGAIN. THANKS	1
I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time	0
These are the best slippers I have ever owned!!! They cradle your feet in super soft memory foam. When I get home from work everyday, I slide my feet into them and am instantly relaxed. I love these slippers!!! The best ever... after much wear, I will buy another pair!	1
I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.
No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured	1

This jacket is well-made, stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks. Great addition to a professional wardrobe	1
My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory. 
These are nice sweatshirts.  Good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a Champion brand.  It is oversized so order your normal size and don't count on much shrinkage	1

I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the "Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the "Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra," which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).
Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.	0

 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past	0
So, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.
Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing	0

I bought the wrong size, the bra was too big, but the straps dug into my shoulders -- that's what wasn't soft...customer service returns was great though. (Essentials.com via Amazon	0
This bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck	1
I bought these boots for my husbamd. He only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down. I will never purchase them again....	0
This bra is the best nursing bra I have found.  It is very supportive and comfortable.  I like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you.  It holds up very well in the wash.  I would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them. 	1
I ordered this item on September 10, 2006.  As of January 12, 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice.  One star is one star too many	0
This is a great item to have if you are loosing weight.  You can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones	1
This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!!	0
Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly	1
I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.
This is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape don't buy since that is what is showing the most. I think it would rate a 5 if it wasn't lined like previous speedos	1

These shoes are different from anything else I have ever owned.  I truely love wearing them.  They are comfortable, practical and they make me smile every time I wear them!  Order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size and have some fun	1
Sincerly
Great boots.  Perfect for playing in the rain.  Great Quality.  I bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season.  No problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size.  We previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs	1

Incredible boot!  Comfort, style and warmth have proved their way with this boot.  I get positive comments each time I wear them!  The tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too.  You don't slide a bit.  I'll enjoy these for years	1
This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon	0
This is the most comfortable sports shoe that I have worn and I own just about every brand made	1
Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton. If plush means thick material this is not. It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made--Sears, J.C. Penney.Does not llook durable	0
I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes.	1
These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though	0
I love the Garrick sandal. It was exactly what I expected as seen in the stores. Delivery, and service was excellent	1
I purchased these shoes when I started working on a job that required walking almost the entire shift.  My feet are killing me, after working for almost a month.  There is no cushioning in them, nor much arch support	0
I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up	1
i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account. the item was not available and they said i would be credited. still waiting!	0
