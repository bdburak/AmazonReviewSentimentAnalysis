This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it	0
"Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own but
otherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio.
Buying via Amazon as usual is super"	1
As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio.  Total waste of money	0

This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.	1

The silicone is great quality, fits the nano snugly, and the arm band is nice.  Wonderful product, does what it's supposed to do, for a fabulous price. Recommended	1

Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one	0

This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 	1
I ordered the 2-year service plan on May 1st, this day (July 31st), I still have not recievied it. I have contacted them a number of times, and still nothing.  Do not buy from this company	0

I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. 	1

AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.  THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD	0
These batteries have been awesome.  My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs.  Flash recharge is very quick.  Highly recommended	1

After about 3 weeks of operation, the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy.  Looking for a better option	0

This is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe. The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow. If you are going for looks only...they are good. If you want any kind of foot comfort...skip it	0
seems to be good quality. has a strong rubber scent, and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though	1
I LOVE THE STYLE, FABRIC, FIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE (BUT IT IS A T-SHIRT) I'M 5'2 AND IT DOESN'T COME PAST MY HIPS	0
I don't bother charging my Zune from the computer any more. This is the only way to go	1
The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night	0
I bought it in Feb 2006, never had any problem. Occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units (sender and receiver) fixes the problem. I am so satisfied I am buying another pair	1
the material is nice, but the size is too small.  I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee, the sleeve is too short	0
Very good product. Small, easy to store. Well worth the very reasonable price	1
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	0
"I'm not any expert in the computer world. But this product it is very easy to install. The range is very strong.
I'm very hapy with this product!!!"	1
"I wish there was a rating of ""0"".  This was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided.   The armband cut through and tore the back completely off.   I am returning it"	0
The product description is incorrect, USB 2.0 works fine on the newer Macs that have such ports. It's overpriced; buy a gently-used one	1
"This wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from Brazil.
Maybe is good for another country`s document"	0
I use this bag to carry my HP NC6000 business notebook. I have received many complements on this bag	1
It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it	0
These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried.  And given their low price, what is there not to like?  I would recommend these to just about anyone	1
Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $20 to return/exchange	0
It costs 30% - 40% less than the Canon LA-DC58F Conversion Lens Adapter and it's metal, not plastic... need to say more	1
I wear boxers but boxer brifes look sexer so every one start wear boxer brifes that way you wont get pantsed or get a wegie	0
Excellant product, excellant price, hope to do business again, ty, for fast speedy shipment, a pleasure doing business with you	1
"The item looks cheap. I ordered a medium size but it was 2X bigger than the regular size. ""Ugly"	0
"Excellent machine, great performance 

Saved lot of time and desk space. Great Scanning speed and qualit"	1
I broke through the toe on the second wearing.  Lousy product	0

All I can say is... You will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator"	1
I keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices $9,10 or 11, where are they?  How do I find out	0
We purchased this TV in Dec of 2006.  We are very happy with it.  It was very easy to plug and play...had it ready in no time for holiday... I would definitely recommed it to new buyers	1
"super low price advertised on 'select sizes and colors'.

oh and u have to add to your cart before you know the price"	0
It was easy ordering, easy delivery and satisfying outcome. Love the TV	1
i didn't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don't like it it's feels it's for old ladies	0
Have only used it a couple of times in a month, and feel like I've already justified the low cost. - Should be fine for my intermittent use	1
This bra is definately not for the over B cup set. The openings are too big and you'd be better off wearing nothin	0
Right price and works off of USB!  The sound is terrible on MacBook so this will fill in nicely	1
It has a very loose fit and I feel a little silly, but pulling it out of the package I totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me. It is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly	0
Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection	1
"I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.

"The garment I received was labeled large.  In fact, at best it is a ""small"". The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled"	0
sent quickly and nicely packaged. these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program	1
The tape didn't stick well - plus the packaging was misleading, the box said it contained 2 bras (which you really need when the tape on the first one fails, you can try the second).  I threw it away	0
The stick came in an excellent condition, and works perfectly. I recommend this product.	1
I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point I can no longer wear it.  Bummer after just wearing it once	0
Elegant design, sturdy construction.  Supports my Yamaha SY35 securely.  After reading the forbidding reviews I decided to assemble it without first reading the directions.  It took me 10 min	1
I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade	0
Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie	1
"it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell... 

cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it."	0
I received a pleasent surprise. The keyboard was shipped sooner than I expected, arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I will buy from this vendor again	1
Was not the same boot from the pictures. Got very sad when opend my packet	0
It does work/live with DSL installed on the same line, ever heard of DSL filters? Too small? are you kidding? this phone is great all around	1
The writing was peeling off this badly.  I can't let me child wear this.  I threw it out	0
The case is nice, but I bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard.  It was too small.  The price was great, and the transaction was flawless	1
I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited. I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time	0
 Compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special CF's with extended bases. Other than that, it can't be beat for the price and quality. Adorama Rocks	1
This luggage did not last for even one flight.  It was torn in the corners and the handles were broken.  I did contact the company and was given a full refund though	0
Not a bad product, but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well, no matter where the antenna is positione	1
Am I the only one sick and tired of this t-shirt???? Give it a rest already!! I can't browse without seeing it, the dead horse is beaten to oblivion!!	0

It's very comfortable to use it....."	1
The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months.  The bag is now basically unusable.	0
I purchased this so my PC could share a monitor with my XBOX360.  Does the job at a cheap cost!  So easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it	1
I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money	0
"Code length of this product is very small. I had to buy an extention cord.
The sound quality is not bad"	1
"You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!!
I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ......"	0

I hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the iPod, and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches. Thanks for a  fantastic product	1
The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.	0
Use original Epson Brand ink, the heads in the epson printers it's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge, it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer	1
Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it.	0
I've had HP and Lexmark printers in the past.  This Canon outshines both of the other brands.  It is super easy to install WITHOUT any troubleshooting.  Works like a charm.  The prints looks great	1
The sound works but the light does not	0
"Everything works great. The only marginal issue is that the batteries don't last a full eight hours. It works in the car but cuts in and out.
Guess I have to break down and buy the car kit"	1
Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.	0
My dad and I installed it in just an hour!  It was very.  You can't beat this price.  I found the same mount at Best Buy for over $200!!! 	1
i ordered this buckle, the one shown in the pictures, and i received a different buckle, a red white and blue confederate flag, not the knife/buckle	0
Great soundcard!  I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better.  I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!)  I'm glad I got this card	1
This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture. Loose threads on it. Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift.  I wouldn't recommend this item.  It definitely cost more than it was worth	0
Very solid, nice looking shelf, easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included.  It's exactly as I expected it	1
I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on.  The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible	0
I've had these earphones for about two month and I've discovered the following.  I like the look and they seem to be well made.  The only grip I have is that they are not very loud.  	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
Great product but is only $30 at iriver.com's stor	1
This bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra's I've tried.  It's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin.  I would not recommend it	0
It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too	1
this bra was a terrible waste of money. the wire on one side stabs me constantly. the other side is fine. it's obviously defective.	0
They are great for putting DVD's, CD's in.  They arrive in great condition	1
Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable, rubbery, poor traction giving and painful sole.  I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper	0
A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. The red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem	1
I love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already! Can I send them back	0
"Just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from Western Digitals website you should have no problems.
Very nice"	1
These pants are fine if you have a very short rise, but I can't imagine that they would fit most people. I will be returning my order	0
THis is a great drive for your money if you use Mac, Windows, and Linux. I use all of them and it works great, I do wish that they had an 8 Gig versions out, but this one will do for now	1
"For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic ""torpedo"" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable. "	0
Having a bad view of the southern sky, I needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.It maded all the difference. Great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable	1
Tan color looks very synthetic, cheapens look of shoe.  Also very wide fitting	0
A very good product, but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself. Howard rules!	1
You'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult. Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me	0
Ordered directly from HP. Fast delivery,solid package. No dead pixel. Works perfec	1
didn't like these.  infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o	0
The lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease.  Product is easy to use and understand.  For the money a great purchase.	1
These are paper thin cotton and feel rough.  They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate!  A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan	0
Very nice player. HDMI works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy. Blue light lets you see the disc's and looks very cool. 1080i with upscaling on all my DVDs.	1
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN!	0
There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever	1
I really wanted to like these, but they just won't stay put.  It's not a thong, but it will be after a few hours of wear.  I usually love DKNY products, so I am disappointed	0
This mouse has never let me down. Really works on most of the surfaces	1
The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was.  My son exchanged it	0
GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS	1

These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool..	1
If you return items Amazon will charge you for shipping both ways whether the product was satisfactory or not.  Don't buy from Amazon	0
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right	1
I'M JUST NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THIS THING. DOESN'T QUITE FIT RIGHT OR LOOK RIGHT...AT LEAST I ONLY PAID 5 BUCKS..	0
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :	1
Thin cloth...aweful insulation factor,,,,does not look good on me..	0
Your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks!  I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered	1

Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say	1
I ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends Juilliard.  They looked terrible because they were shiney.  The worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange. 	0
The shirts are what I had asked for.  They are sturdy and well made.  I would buy more if I needed more.  Well worth the money spen	1
Bah, this skirt looks weird and cheap. It is not sewn on the bottom, just cut.	0
It's golden color is very remarkable ..It looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have	1
I bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife, my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match, I'm really pissed off, if you gonna buy this piece of junk, beware with the size	0
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied	1
"This is very cheaply made, from very poor quality fabric.

The styling is not good, and the fit is poor.It does not resemble the photgraph.

Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place	1
I didn't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality. It already came with a loose thread. But it fits good. 	0
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve	1
Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality	0
Awesome shoes. Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless. I'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously, and who likes to look even cooler when doing it.	1
it took a week and two days for my pants to arrive, i bought another item from amazon the same day and it arrived in three days. My experience with this company's shipping wasn't good	0
This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow.	1
While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag, the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack	0
The sheets were just as described and worth the price. Timely on shippng also. Very pleased	1
This shoe looked nice and stylish, but turned out to be very narrow (even though I've ordered it in size wide!!!) and uncomfortable.  Also had some glue marks on it--I had to return it	0
The Crib sheets were soft, the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress	1

Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced	1
I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived. They appear used and have a small stain on them. As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again. Lesson learned	0
Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things, and they are working great!  Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected! Thanks!	1
Sadly, this well designed item doesn't work for me.   It comes detached from its clip while I'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off	0

Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.	1
The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase agai	0
Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent.	1
I had to send this item back because it was to small.  The sizes run small, so beware	0
I was very pleased with the socks.  They were just what we were looking for!  Thanks so much	1
"i never recieved the product.
the order was cancelled by the sende"	0
i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items	1

I bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is.  i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back.  Very rude	0
The slippers are great!  They do seem to be on the large side of a 15.  My husband had to put paper in the toes.  He wears 15 in every thing else	1
This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck. It is light and drapes well. But it is too light for printing.	0
I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit.  My little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! Thanks so much !	1
I purchased this as a gift for a teenager.  She told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper.  It is being returned	0
Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl	1
I can't imagine who could pull off these clown pants. They're unwearable!  What was Hanes thinking?	0
One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn.  I own several, and they're just about all I'll wear!  Very nice fit, and good look under clothes	1
The product was not quite what I expected, but I got a quick return to my satisfaction.  Happy shopping	0
I got this jacket last week, I liked it for the price i paid	1
i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like	0
Single Style, good shoes. I think is a nice choice to every day work	1
this device didnt work properly at all, i lost my money on this purchase.sorry, but that's how i feel	0
They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash	1
I love the color and the flexibility of the material. It doesn't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection	0
I LOVE these shoes...I have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. I also love the price	1
I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing	0
The fit is great. Sexy slim look and feel. Slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim. Got lots of compliments	1
This light worked for one day. I should have known better because in the past, I bought a tap light, and it worked for only a few days, too. Don't waste your money	0
the price for the slippers was average- no big discount, but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas. That was a big plus. And my daughter loved them	1
"I have a small head and it makes it look huge!

Maybe if i had a big head it would look alright  pfff"	0
Very cute tops, for a nice price.  They wash up good.  They do run a little big, just so you are aware	1
Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price. 	0
The beading on the bag is fantastic, and its very cute.  The color is even more exquisite in person.  It's just big enough to hold ID, a little money, and a lipstick, perfect for going out at night	1
Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better	0
my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present	1
It is a comfortable little t-shirt dress for 9 bucks.  Be careful because the sizes run small.  If you get it, buy a size larger than you normally would	0
They are perfect for kids daily lunches.  Would like to order more but don't where to start. Lost all the ordering information	1
The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use.  I won't recommend it to anyone	0

"The shoes are true to size and very comfortable. But only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate. 
Really expected a better quality."	0
The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy. I think it is real good	1
Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use.	0
These are very cute and they fit great.  I wear them all the time	1

We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk.  Rather stiff and uncomfortable	0

My son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp & he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play	0
can't believe how true to size they are. They're quite easy to move in, and they're simple and beautiful. Not at all cheap-looking for the price. I expected less and got more	1

I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter	1
Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs	0

The Lilyette Maximum Support bra is well made and wears well.  It holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features.  It is comfortable	1
I would not buy this sweater.  It is flimsy, and not very quality feeling.  The price was too good to be true	0
I love naughty monkey! I'm so happy with their shoes! They don't hurt my feet	1
After one washing, the letters were all rolled up. I was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie. The quality of the graphic was horrible	0
Good quality jeans at an affordable price. Size is just right, quite comfortable	1

I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price	1
i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing	0
The slippers were perfect, exactly what I wanted.  The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do. Thank You very much	1
Found the item to be poorly designed. Did not fit my checks or recorder. Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear	0
Great slippers, very comfortable. I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure.  And the black ones are perfect because they don't show dirt like the white ones	1

This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable	1
I did not expect the Jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini. These should be renamed Jockey Show-Everything Bikini	0
They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again	1
Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!	0
My mother loves these pants.  I know they are for men, but she loves the way they fit her.  They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better. 	1

I like the flip case. It is exactly what i wanted. However,the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it.	1

incorrect color was shown on the website.  it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase.	0
I love this jacket.   It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather.  It is also long enough to cover my rear.  Very good in the rain, too	1
Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them	0

I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful.  The Lalita is very uncomfortable.  They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub.  I was truly disappointed	0
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended	1

This is great.  I measured before I put it on & after.  I lost over 2 inches.  I highly recommend this	1
My mouth dropped when i received this item.  the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use.  For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets	0
I really like this case, it fits so perfectly that the Zen doesn't rattle around or anything, yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible.  Easy to get on and off, too, and looks great	1

GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.	1
At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0
Reef makes the best sandals, the price is pretty much set, no real savings here, but the selection is great.  They may look like other sandals, but don't be fooled... They're TOP NOTCH	1
The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off. 	0
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)	1

Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.	0

I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding.  It arrived quickly, looked great, and was an awesome price.  It would be hard to beat this great deal	1
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)	0
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper	1
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended	0
These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine, are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking.  It's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate.	1
After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe	0
I own this halter top in black & white.  The colors are vibrant & the fabric quality is very good.  This style runs small, so order 1 size up for a comfy fit. This company's customer service rocks	1

Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.  	1

This item was just what I was looking for.  I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband's ties or a tie bar.  It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving. 	1

Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed	0
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes	1
I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra.  This bra fits horribly.  Do not buy if you are DD/E cup!  This bra is uncomfortable and doesn't hold your goods properly	0
Very quick delivery.  Price was very good compared to other online companies.  Will use again	1
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
This bra is very comfy and also quite sexy for a sports bra!  I am a b cup and am using it for low to moderate impact activities and have found it quite supportive and comfortable	1
"it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces. 
look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good"	0
They looks nice, and fit really well, however, not so soft like some other Clarks/Indigo. 	1
I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!?	0
Fits, Great quality,great sale price- If your lucky you don't get what you pay for	1
These were not as expected, there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels, there was just an open hole. He has problems using these too!	0
"El producto lo recibi en perfectas condiciones, excelente comprarle a ustedes.-

This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again	0
The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side	1
i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped	0
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!	1
i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips!	0
 My husband bought me these for Christmas and I have had more compliments on these!! The flare styling and laces set them off 	1
The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad	0
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you	1
These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans	0
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected	1
You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them. 	0
I actually purchased the Silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend. He loves and it was much cheaper than the one Creative offers on their website.	1
I agree.  Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy	0
I LOVE these shoes!!!!!they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price.i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase	1
This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back	0
Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy	1
I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game	0
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want	1
"Until today, 01/09/2007, I did not yet receive item Hi-Cut Brief 7_8701_1176 XL/Light Beige

both purchased on 11/30/200"	0
I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress. This scarf was perfect. It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap. Very pretty	1
just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them. 	0
I buy these wherever I can find them.  It's a bit of a tribute to my aunt, for her middle name, but wish I could find them more frequently. 	1
Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18.  The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother	0
The product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what I had ordered.  I really like it	1
Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality	0
on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio	1
These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely. Do not buy them.	0
These shoes are so comfortable and cute! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, and I like their old-school Pony look	1
The scarf itched my neck, smelled funny and was not the color of ivory. It was beige. It is not cashmere. It would not itch if it were cashmere	0
I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn't see the item but was told it was very cute	1
I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.  On the picture it looks more blue than purple	0
These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had them.  The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time.  The fit is perfect and comfortable	1
These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	0
I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai	1
Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me	0
"These were purchased for a wedding.  The quality is very good.  We would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black,pink, grey, and white.

Thank you,

These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk	0
These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM	1
she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all	0
"I initially bought these shoes for my mom for a Christmas gift, but she said they were too high for her. Well i fixed that, I kept them for myself.  :)
I love them and they are really hot! 
Thnx
Ja"	1
I would not buy this product again.  It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end	0
"My  only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff
Otherwise Great Gym Pant"	1
The item is not my concern; I still have not even received it	0
This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount.  Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though	1
VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle	0
I love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them.  I am the envy of the girls at work	1
I ORDERED A LARGE AND ASSUMED IT WAS ADULT SIZE...THIS LARGE WAS LIKE A GIRLS SIZE LARGE....VERY SMALL SIZING  I RETURNED THE SWEATER..	0
The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.	1
I am so disappointed.  Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size	0
"Good material and does the job that it promises!! All other brands claim to do the same thing but ""not all glitters are gold"" :"	1
Don't buy these.  I used to love Florsheim (I still wear an old pair of Comfortech's) but I got a bad pair of these	0
great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting	1
I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn't get it on and I don't have a narrow foot	0
the shawl was beauiful and just the right color. an excellent value too.very good product fast shippin	1
"The foam padding does not have enough consistancy. It stays compressed with in a short period of time. 
Not recommended"	0
Arrived fast and in time for V-day! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival	1
"Ordered large, got ""youth large"", too small. Threw out receipt before checking. My bad. wife now wears T-shirt to work out in"	0
I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY	1
Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine	0
"i tried these on and i'll never wear boxers again!
They are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight.
they are tight, but not too tight. I wear these to school
as well! I love them"	1
Sorry, there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months...runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer.  Can be seen straight through	0
It's a very nice polo, very soft and nice to a casual date	1
.............they sent me the wrong size...and didn't leave clear returning guidelines. You are better off getting something cheaper, because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck	0
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :-	1
This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide.  They run small.  They look nicer in the picture than they actually are	0
"It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out.

I wear it cycling and golfing"	1
This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now	0
The wallet was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  He loved the wallet, the leather, the design, style, and sleek look of the Fossil wallet. It was a great purchase and a good value	1
I did not like this product at all. It is very hard to use and  too small	0
this is a form fitting, but not to snug nightshirt. gives freedom of movement, yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material. deffinitly will order more of thes	1
Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.	0
I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.	1
This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms	0
Great grip, cool rugged look, comfortable enough for regular winter use as well. Was about $80 when I got it though. Might not be the best option around for $130	1
The item was not as pictured.  It is funky and of poor quality.  The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this	0
Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order	1
"For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.
Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item.  I will never shop Amazon or any online store"	0
Spectacular item.  Wears well on a fine woman.  My wife is short, and this item fit fine, especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall	1
The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars	0
Thank you for this Great Gift for a baby shower States away that you made helpful and she loves i	1
I have done a review on these socks already, which has not appeared.  They are not a good buy	0
These go on real easy, and come off real easy.  They feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away.  I'm ordering more	1
I like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out. I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small. 34B fits in other brands so I know it's not because I've got bigger	0
The shorts were everything I wanted. The service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time. I bought him all the colours available	1
if you have a 60 gig iPod, this isn't 4 u... it is way too tight, limits access to the click reel, and completly blocks access to the hold butto	0
I own 2 pairs ...They are classy and go with everything,but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it	1
I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used.	0
shirts are what I had expected and the service was grea	1
Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended	0
I am very pleased with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look great as well. 	1
I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time	0
This is cute, funny, and it's not uncomforable! I think it rocks! I love this movie...I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing	0
This is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra I have even owned.  Have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now.  The fit is unbelievable	1
I bought the wrong size, the bra was too big, but the straps dug into my shoulders -- that's what wasn't soft...customer service returns was great though. (Essentials.com via Amazon	0
This sandle is very comfortable and attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle	1
I bought these boots for my husbamd. He only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down. I will never purchase them again....	0
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking	1
I ordered this item on September 10, 2006.  As of January 12, 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice.  One star is one star too many	0
The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service.	1
This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!!	0
See my review for the Desert Digital.  I own both the woodland and the desert BDU's	1
These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though	0
"Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate.
thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo"	1
i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account. the item was not available and they said i would be credited. still waiting!	0
This bra fits, is comfortable, and invisible under T-shirts. I hope they keep making it forever	1
This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order. I ordered a size 9, but wasn't able to wear them. I gave them to my little brother who's a size 7, they fit him perfectly	0
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class	1
I have Goddess bras, and it seems that each style has it's own sizing.  The love at first sight bra fits wonderfully, while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be	0
I love it. It is just what I wanted. Great deal and smooth transaction. Thanks	1
 This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.	0
Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions.  It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot.	1
Item send was not new. Obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use. Also a rip in the design	0
speedy delivery  product  as  stated   would buy from them agai	1
All boot is made with mademan materials. Then they are not as comfortable as I want. With the same amount you can find a better option	0
This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!	1
"Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!!
It's just waste of mone"	0
These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either	1
I would definitely recommend getting a size AND width larger, as these fit very snuggly	0
"These socks are wonderful.  Just the right weight, very comfortable and warm.
Don't fade after washing, etc. etc.   I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more"	1
Like I said, they didn't fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive. :	0
The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price.  Very satisfied	1
Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in	0
I where these shoes all the time. They are really comfortable to run in	1
"Poor quality, belts do not fit correctly, can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy.
Don't trust Skinny Dip Swimwear"	0
I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs. Not only I did grow up wearing their brand, but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs. If somethings not broke why fix it	1
I did realize that these shoes squeaked, but I didn't anticipate how loudly that squeak would be! I doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making- I know I couldn't	0
I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. Thanks	1
Like all the Haynes T-shirts except the 50/50, these bunch at the back of the neck. Try another brand	0
This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company. 	1
The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good.	0
Love Hush Puppies.  They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable	1
Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on. 	0
The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job 	1
This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctl	0
Great overall shirt.  Good quality, wears well.  Wear it proudly	1
A good product and a good fit.  Wish the logo had been a little bigger	0
This sweater fits perfect - exactly what I was looking for and I coudn't go wrong with this fabulous price.  My husband liked it as well	1
no lace collar as advertised. cheap, nylon-like fabric. not worth the price	0
Soo comfortable and soo warm.  The only thing that sucks about them is that they aren't waterproof	1
I am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been USmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday, March 28	0
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too	1
do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal	0
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	1
I am tired of companies making money off of fakes.  The U.S. Government did not buy their field jackets from China.  These M65 O.D. Green Field Jackets are not real--They are a mid-grade reproductions	0
and I am very pleased with them.  They are very comfortable!!  My sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	1
"The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.
I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.
The shoes are still too small."	0
This is my husband's favorite shirt because it's light and comfortable. It is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat	1
These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small!  I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear	0
These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn.  They are worth every penny, in my opinion.  They are designed for a man, plus they seem to not gather moisture, as some fabrics do	1
I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance, and it arrived too late for me to wear it.  It's still in the package in my closet.  Maybe next year..	0
It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way	1
Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT!	0
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy	1
I bought these for a bridal shower gift. They say one size fits all but they where like an XXXSmall. They torn right when they where tried on. VERY POOR QUALITY!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE	0
I really liked the Black Tuxedo Outfit, my son wore it in a pageant and won, so I am very very happy about that. The tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him	1
The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief	0
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase	1
The jacket itself its well made. BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture..	0
If your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you can't go wrong with the cami/panty combo. Its cute but sexy. Very nice	1
"Looks nothing like the image shown. 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee, let alone over it (and she isn't tall 5'5""). Keep looking...."	0
I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well	1
Men here is a tip.  If you want to please your lady, use a sexy thong instead.  We love how a man looks in a thong	0
This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever.  I highly recommend it	1
These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters	0
More than pleased...excited.  The price was better than local stores; should have purchased several pairs.  Easy on the feet, wear well, and on and off at the airport	1
I prefer the bibsters.  The quality on the toss away bibs is not as good - the material is quite thin, the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed	0
My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter.  They are perfect, washing easily, and retaining their size and color	1
I got this for my newborn son and it's so big- it fits my husband.  I wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat!!	0
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear	1
Lasts only 2 weeks! Try them if you don't believe me	0
Got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well	1
What a bad product!  They didn't last two weeks before they began to smear my windshield	0
This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.  	1
Bought 3 pairs for all my cars. What a waste of money: didn't last a week before they started to smear windshield! Garbage	0
Quality product, exactly what I wanted, but it runs large. I wear a half size, bought the size larger & now think I'll buy the smaller size	1
Waste of money, lasted ONLY 2 weeks this summer. Garbage. Pay a little more for Bosch or same for Anco	0
Very warm and comfortable for the price.  For any price, really.  Nice, looks good, feels comfy, keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least	1
TO REPLACE THE BATTERY YOUR HAVE TO OPEN THE BACK, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE REMOVE IT FROM WHERE ITS STUCK, OPEN THE BACK AND RE-STICK IT AGAIN THUS LOOSING THE STRENGTH OF THE ORIGINAL GLU	0
Good bag, I thought it was a little bigger, but it worked out great	1
I seriously hope that the price tag I am seeing is ($7,000+) is a mistake..	0
I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too	1
I installed this cover and took pictures from various distance and angel. I could read all numbers clearly.  They claim that it will work with actual traffic camera. I have no way to test that	0
"Esta tienda es muy rapida en contestar y enviar el producto adquirido.
Es toy muy contento con el producto que adquiri por que es exactamente lo que deseaba."	1
Listen if you truly want an ionizer that dramaticaly changes the air. I strongly advise people to purchase one by Flair.  This home unit retails for $300.  Need results, that's what a real one costs	0
Very comfortable and feel. No one makes it like Under Armour	1
They broke the first time that I used them.  The locking mechanism is cheap and slides out of its intended slot.  Don't waste your money on this item	0
This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  =	1
Bought one of these to jump start my 3.6 litre 911. It doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged. Complete waste of time, maybe it will start a lawn mower.	0
   I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price	1
It is ok for small dogs, large dogs will knock it down	0
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army	1
Loved the price but I never actually received the item.  It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :-	0
This top runs small, so order next size up.  Vibrant colors, nice fabric, comfy, attractive fit.	1
"The product came defective, so I had to throw it away.
I emailed the company three times and nobody ever answered back."	0
The product arrives just as shown. Sturdy, attractive leather. Just the right size for small items. This is an A++ product	1
I could not get enough vacuum to draw the oil from the crankcase... unit would not work.  I am very dissatisfied with the product	0
I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them	1
The pump in theory suppose to suck oil out of the dipstick hole. It did not do it for Honda engine. It did for snowblower. You will need to get dirty to change your own oil	0
My baby loves his new kicks!! They came quick and would recomend them to anyone	1
i followed the instructions to the letter , but it only worked about 50 % of the time. i will be sending it bac	0
Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles	1
Thought I'd just confirm what I've learned too.  I bought it, realized after research it could be picked in seconds with a pen and returned it	0
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.	1
"""Advanced Security"" is all a lie.  These locks can be easily opened without a key.  I have written to the Masterlock company and they replaced the lock free of charge to a one that uses a regular key"	0
Very comfortable, but the straps keep coming loose. 	1
Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place.	0
My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter.	1
 You are better off with a sponge and a bucket . There ain't a quick fix to washing your car without going to the local car wash	0
Excellent product. Item arrived fast and exactly as described. Works like a charm. Haven't yet had TSA open the lock, but it does the job	1
Arrived with dead batteries in it, factor the price and time of getting three AAA batteries on your own into your decision of whether to buy this product or not	0
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour	1

I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else	1
This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit	0

It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire.  It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  STAY CLEAR. 	0
These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price	1

I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:	1
you cant chose the music to play.... not that loud.... overall sucks.. (just get the airhorns...) if i wasnt too lazy to return this item i would have... it sucks..	0
It's just what I wanted. I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel.	1
The seat covers are cute, but only 1 comes in a box and while I was putting them in my car one of them ripped! Obviously the quality is not very good	0
not as pretty as I hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit. DO not regret the purchas	1
"...if I can see what I'm buying?

Please, add a picture"	0
Well, since I will be using this soon, I believe it will be just perfect. Holds all the necessary items safely, so will let you know when I return from my trip	1
This is a single extension.  The product description is completely misleading	0
Material was not overly thick and designs were great! Look good on my daughter	1
Very dissapointing.  The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims	0
I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower.  I've looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more.  These socks stay on my little boy's feet and are made very well	1
I'd give this a zero if allowed. Easily leaks from both twist caps. Any money I saved by changing my oil was spent on degreaser and paper towels cleaning my garage floor	0
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old	1

Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic	1
I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it.	0
I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly	1

I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on	1
Every single time, the reading is way low - around 94.9 or something like that.  It is extremely unreliable.  Don't waste your money	0
Great product with speedy delivery. The shoes arrived before I expected and were exactly what I wanted. Thank you!	1
I USE THIS AT WORK WHERE I HAVE INFANTS UP TO TODDLERS, WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS 3 TIMES BEFORE WE EVER GET AN ACCURATE READING.  THE UNDER THE ARM, OLD TRADITIONAL THERMOMATERS ARE BETTER	0
The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.	1
I loved this at first. But after two months of daily use the thing broke. I cant get it back together. I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside	0

Baby Age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set, refusing changing it to the crib set. I have to return it by Amazon A-Z Guarantee,wasting a lot of time.	0
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.	1
This seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light.  If I were to do this over, I would buy a different infant seat	0
Swimsuit very cute - size as stated (16 = 20/22)  Bra did not have enough support for me so I wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well.  I love it	1
My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds.  It is not a well designed blanket	0
i love these shoes, they are totally cute. the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper. they aren't as soft as i thought they would be, but i great buy none the less. 	1
I should have read the reviews.  I purchased this item, and it quit working after a week of normal use	0
I just love different and odd things. I love to give people gifts that no one else have.Thanks	1
We have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough.  The double has the same issues; it's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind	0
I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST	1
its a great price but its VERY small. Its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small. There's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it.	0
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.	1
I don't know who JJ Cole made this hat for, my daughter had the tiniest head and it still didn't fit.  Waste of money	0
Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price	1
it's a waste of money. you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet. if not, don't buy it	0

"A very cool product, it got me a lot of attention on 3/22/07 at the OU student Union. At first, it was hard to work. but now, I can even spin!!!
I always wear them to my mom's office"	1
The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom	0
These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy	1
I have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together!  I have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter's other contraptions.  I guess I'll have to sic my husband on it	0
These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.	1
I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst! They are very small, thick, and do not hold much, causing them to overflow and leak. I'd recommend the Gerber pads	0
Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .Do reccomend	1
I went through an entire box in two days!  The fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly.  Plus, the diameter of these are much smaller than any others.  Try Gerber or Lansinoh	0
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets	1
These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  I constantly have to cut the strings:-( 	0
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone	1

Overpriced! Not what I expected! You can't really used it because it's too small for big bellied pregnant women! Uncomfortable! The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy. YUCk	0

"I swear -this is the crime!
The worst product in the western hemisphere.
Never,never buy this piece of garbage"	0
.....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that	1
The maternity support didn't stay in place.  It kept bunching up in one spot and didn't help my back at all!  I would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product	0

These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.	0
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!	1
This product was a waste of my money.  It was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use.  My husband tore it off the day after we got it.  I would rather use duck tape then this product :)  :	0
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it	1
I was really unhappy with this lock.  It not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	0
"This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch. 
Not a summer coat too heavy!!! The next model needs to have pit zips!"	1
definately NOT a potty for boys. As with other reviewers, the shield does not stay on. Looking for another simple and basic potty now :o	0
I have several jackets. They are well made, warm and I wouldn't wear any other. Long lasting and look good with anything	1
This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle	0
This is really a great item, very comfortable.  I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose.  Great for the intended purpose though	1
THESE BOWLS ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  THEY DO NOT STAY ON THE TABLE AT ALL! 	0
The slippers are great; comfortable and good quality. Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago. Buying them online was so convenient	1
The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat.  They do come in lovely colors, though	0
I absolutely love this suit, my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down	1
Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants.  So now it sits in my car fading in the sun.  Save your money	0
Very comfortable and sexy. Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace	1

After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enoug	0
I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32. The bathing suit was too tight. I'll get in on size 34 next time	1
waste of money.  does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this	0
A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified	1
I bought this but it's junk. My husband and I have both tried it on ourselves and can't get it to register of 95 degrees. That's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one	0
"This is a fine leather bag, beautiful, comfortable! 
I bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping. Its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship!

THESE ARE THE SOFTEST - MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS!   YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER	1
As the other reviewer stated, the seal appears to be faulty on this, and it stopped working almost straight away.  I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well	0
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon	1
Product is not worth the money. Made the bassinet very unstable	0
awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet	1
"do not like this product
it is very hard to get rail under bed

These socks are just what I was looking for, a thin cotton blend to wear running.  No bunching and they breath very well.  The price and timliness of the order was also great	1
It's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached.  Effectively serves its purpose, but for nearly 16 bucks?!!  Puleeeeeeeease	0
Have always been pleased with this manufactures product. The company I purchased from was fair priced and very efficient	1

Plugged into Ipod and guess what! Audio and video came out the other end! A little spendy but what can ya do	1
We got this as a gift and  have used it 0 times.  It's expensive and poorly designed.  A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper, easier to fold, and nicer looking	0
The socks were nice but cost too much .  Price a little unreasonable	1
I bought this bundle me in Nov and it did not even last 2.5 months.  The zipper broke.  It is not well made.  Stick with the other bundle mes.  The urban bundle me is cheaply made.  Not worth the pric	0
Calvin Klein provides a fashionable, comfortable underwear. Tight but not too tight, it holds you in place, while not constricting you to a tight position. Excellent, but don't buy them too little	1

I've been looking for black sport socks for a long time!  Finally, a black comfortable, cushy sport sock of medium thickness.  I'm completely satisfied	1
Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls	0
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again	1
I can't get it to stick! I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold, but as soon as I put toys in it, it falls	0
I am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . Very Pleased	1

I bought this for my daughter.  She is into pink and camo???   Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it.  What more is there to say	1
The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter.  My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her. 	0
"I love the sweatshirt! It came exactly as pictured and in time for me to 
wear it for the Super Bowl"	1
This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing	0
Tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable. The stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix. GOOD DEAL	1
These don't fit my cabinets because the width between knobs is too large.  I'm not sure how, but if possible, verify the width on your cabinets against what these offer	0
The zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job, the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly, easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	1
Maybe it's just me, but I can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature	0
i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week	1
Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer	0
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to	1
Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!	0
I bought my wife the set and she loves it, everything from Figleaves has beed great	1
How annoying to pay $25 more here than at Walmart. Same price at Babies R Us. Is it really the same exact thing? Very frustrating.	0
I love these running shoes.  They have a great look and they feel great, too. They fit my feet perfectly	1
I found all of the Avent cups really hard to clean!  I couldn't get the stopper out of the top of the cup.  The Playtex cups are WAY easier to use! 	0
I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised	1
The colors are very diferent, they supposed to be blue, yellow and white,and I recived in a pale yellow. The material is not very good. I don't recomend this product.	0

This jacket is well-made, stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks. Great addition to a professional wardrobe	1
Great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction.  It would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table ...really	0
These are nice sweatshirts.  Good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a Champion brand.  It is oversized so order your normal size and don't count on much shrinkage	1
Do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet. The tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	0
This is a great item to have if you are loosing weight.  You can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones	1
It is very difficult to attach it to anything. The straps are to short and under strange angel. My son did not play with it	0
Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly	1

This is the most comfortable sports shoe that I have worn and I own just about every brand made	1
I have gotten better results with Sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped	0
I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes.	1
I agree with the previous review.  The deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out	0
I love the Garrick sandal. It was exactly what I expected as seen in the stores. Delivery, and service was excellent	1
Looks nice. Unfortunately did not power up the camera, so I can't say much else. Going to cost me return shipping at the very least. Sorry I didn't buy the Canon product instead	0

This is my favorite for lap swims.  Reasonable modesty, but not baggy.  You'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage.  If you are not looking for a tan, get this one!	1

Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size.   I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size.	1

The product features are ok, but the screen is very small. Also, the resolution needs to be better. The photos were very grainy. An impressive looking product with not so impressive output	0
Works great.....use it on my Harley and it is a perfect tool for Father's Day	1
You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.	0
This is simply the finest tire gauge that I have owned or come across	1

Take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire	1
The camera operates good, but I thought it was suppose to be new.  It looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom.  It does work, but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	0
great item at a great price... I bought two for a bit more than one at local stores..	1
I was counting on a THREE HOUR working battery. After all, that's what it says it gives you.  So far all I get from it, after more than a month of use, is two hour, max..	0
"My ""trusty"" Ford Escort experienced cold shock when moved from TX to PA in December. It needed to be jump started -- the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use"	1
Great camera for the price. But I guess you get what you pay for, bad warranty...........	0
Just be careful when using it in tinted windows. They filter out the sun and the motor doesn't spin	1
I would agree with the other review.  The indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable.  I will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another	0
I love may cargo organizer.  Rather that have all my stuff slide around in the trunk of my car, I have it all right at my finger tips inside the organizer	1
"The case does not fit and the battery is incorrect for
the DX759"	0
bag all in all is fine. the stiffners were hard to fit and two had to ne trimmed, other than that it is a fine catch all for emergency item	1
I don't see how they can recommend this kit for all DX cameras.  The DX7590 would barely fit in that case	0
Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it.  No problem	1
Just returned the mobiCam- had poor reception, even in adjacent room! smallo screen & not stable - falls easy & seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house!	0
An excellent product. I bought one for my mom, then tried it, and bought one for myself. A great back support	1
VERY GOOD PRODUCT VERY SATIsfied, the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette	0
I have a rottweiler and a pitbull and it keeps them both in the back of my explore	1
Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review	0
My wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car. Not only does it break the glass, it also has a seatbelt cutter.	1
My frame freezes after displaying a few pictures. The remote doesn't work. There is no website for contact or support	0
My husband is a BMW mechanic and he drives cars all day.  I wish I could get him one for every car	1
Unfortunately I received the items damaged.  The exterior postage box was unharmed but the paper boxes were obviously dropped at some point before packaging.	0
The tool everyone needs for the car - you never know when you will need it	1
Offers no eye comfort whatsoever. Magnification is very weak. Stick to original eye cu	0
Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture	1
"Almost useless! Tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration. Went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier.

For those have back pain or sciatica nerve pain, you have to try this. I didn't believe this until one of my colleague let me tried it for a few days. It makes a big difference with my situation.	1
This bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets.  Quite small for the price.   Just paying for the name on the bag	0
I use one in the car and one in the house.  It works for me	1
Purchased this item in Dec 06' Screen burned out Mar 07'. On top of that screen quality was not that great. Do not order order this item	0
"This really help me on my 4500 mile trip in my Toyota van. I am thinking getting one for home too.

You have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that I have purchased it I discover that this battery doesn't fit this camera. It is listed wrong	0
i got the car buddies frog covers for my daughter. it was a birthday present. she absolutly loved them. she is a big frog collecter. her whole dashboard is covered in frogs	1
I gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift,we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy....not a good gift.	0
It is really very nice, and my colleague would like to buy that too. They made my car looks very comfortable	1
The camera came with no memory  chip.  The online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund.  Not a great experience	0
I use this for changing the oil in my Mercedes S320.  It performs flawlessly and with minimal effort.  I look forward to using it again. 	1
"I got to the tip of Alaska, and none of the four batteries worked  no power!

Used on Dodge Grand Caravan Roof Rack on roundtrip from KY to FL in the rain - worked great.  Rain-X is also on Axius carrier	1
Did not get Kodak Max, instead recieved regular Kodak CRV3 battery. I thought I was ordering a better version, seller NEEDS to change misleading picture!	0
The dual grips are kind of handy - it fits securely into place	1
"Poor and slow Focus and flash. Thought Nikon had a good name.......Wrong
If you like this camera it must be you first digital"	0
"Works great,good price,fast shipping.good packaging. All is well.
          Thanks, Larr"	1
"We have NOT received this item yet.
Please let me know the current status"	0
"hi all 
I am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me .
It has the features I wanted it to have,  and is very easy to use"	1
This is not at all suitable for young children.  It's awkward and difficult to use.  We're sending it back.  Totally inappropriate for children	0
This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo	1
This battery is NOT compatible with the the JVC-GRD270US video camera.  I did get a purchase price refund, but I am out shipping costs both ways	0
I haven't had to use it too much, thank goodness, but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind.  I did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great.  Love it	1
"My kids can see better through a toilet paper roll than this ""telescope.""
Meaning, you can't see a freaking thing through it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"	0
Only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump. Otherwise I'm very pleased with this product.	1
It arrived broken with the stand missing.  I have been waiting to replace it at a local Discovery store	0
This is an all around great emergency product for both car and home.  They only thing is that I wish they had the dimensions so that I could have assessed whether it would be too big or small	1
Try to call Panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first. Panasonic service is the worst one in this world.	0
Saved me twice so far... Tow rope got me out of a snow bank... Has almost everything you need, some things are kind of cheap, but in general, the product gets the job done..	1
This is a poor excuse for a lens coming from Canon.  Can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo.  Please do not waste your money like I did	0
This is the best !!!  Best store,  best service, fast service, and great packageing.  I will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	1
The zipper was broken within one day, and the hook was broken within two days	0
Perfect for my needs.  Stores well in my saddlebags.  I saw it five dollars cheaper at Auto Zone a few days after I received it but I'm still happy with the purchase	1
Date on still photo will not print,it's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	0
Small but reliable. It helps me to save gas and tires. Thanks for it	1
We returned this item.  It was a glorified external DVD burner.  It was not worth the money	0
It looks funny in the ad BUT it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure + I liked the bright colors so they don't get out of sight.	1
"Ordered one new from B&H.  In the 1x mode the top light came on, no worries.
Turned on the bottom setting of the switch, 2x, nothing. Neither light came on.
Pitiful.  Sending it back"	0
 I use it for the air compressor.  I just wish the gauge would be easier to read the numbers are too close together and to smal	1
It never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months. Don't buy, you've been warned	0
I love my tink visor. It matches my tink seat covers and floor mats. I wish it held more cd's though, but it holds the typical amount for a visor (about 10 cd's). I'm very happy with this purchase	1
The camera has really amazing features. But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness. I made a mistake of buying one	0
It's great just the perfect size for the visor and I can still pop open the mirror.Easy to install with the velcro and the cd's stay in tight and easy to remove	1
It fits in the S1, but it doesn't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the OEM version.  When it doesn't charge I just re-insert the batter and it works, but its sort of a bummer	0
THIS ITEM TOPPED OF THE ENTIRE MATCHING SET I BOUGHT FOR MY VAN!! WE LOVE ALL THE TREE FROG PIECES WE PURCHASED	1
I am not satisfied by this product. The calrity is not good. Also this is the most battery consuming device I have ever seen	0
It was simple to install on top of my RV. I was able to put a cover over the panel and keep getting the sunlight to charge the batteries. It charges even through glass on the inside of the RV	1
"When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion.

Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging"	0
Acts more as a flashlight than an area illumination.  Which is OK if you need another flashlight and no more illumination in closets	1
I purchased a Canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and UV filtering lense. The case came within a few days and is perfect for what I needed. Smooth fast transaction. Five star	0
Easy to install and reliable. Even dropped it in the water and no problem, still working even immersed. Of course I had to dry it, but it was easy to disassemble	1
Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it	0
"we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard.
One tap it is on and another it is off. LEDs are the way of the future"	1
The camera is decent. The fact that it doesn't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable.  What do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it	0
I love this thing.  Very convenient and can go mostly anywhere.  Super bright directed light	1
Watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i	0
these ramps work well with my lowrider saturn,i can get up on them without scraping the spoiler,extremely light.a major improvement over the old metal ramps i used as a kid	1
"Hi, 

I have lost the CD rom to download the movie from the camera.

Sony does not offer it for free on its website. You have to pay $70 dollars to get it again.

That clearly disappoints me."	0
Solid sturdy, what can I say, it has a simple job and it does it well.	1
I returned this item.  I have not received notice that they did receive it back so I will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited	0
Great product-light weight stores easily doesn't need much room- will fit under low stance vehicles used mine under my subaru and didn't scrape the bottom of my car. Highly recommended product	1

Fit snugly over the seats in my brand new 2007 Toyota Corolla S Model. Very comfortable material. Nice colors with black background. I love it	1
use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~	0
THIS JUST TOPPED OFF OUR ENTIRE SET  NOW I HAVE EVERY ITEM THAT GOES WITH THIS SET.  AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE I WAS ABLE TO FIND ALL THE PIECES	1
This cable did not fit my camera as stated.  Because of the cost factor, I chose not to return it.  The shipping was more than the cable was worth	0
"Very affordavle, very convinient.
Beautiful design that match  my car sit.

Received product as described within several days of order.  Item is excellent quality and does the job	1

It's what I will need if the car battery is drained.  I hope I never have to use it	1
This is a nice looking brown suede camera case.  Based on all the Stylus models listed, I assumed my Olympic Stylus 595 would fit in it but, unfortunately, it does not. 	0
 very helpful and easy for anyone to use I no longer have to call towtrucks to start my car when my battery fails me the money it saves me is put to better us	1
This is a good charger - quick and portable.  But the battery life of the battery SUCKS! 	0
Our first experience with a cargo carrier was over Christmas.  We were really counting on it and things worked great.  It is very spacious, easy to pack and stores nicely	1
Poor focus, blurry, awful optics. Don't waste your time with this one! Can't compare to the little PURE DIGITAL camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features.	0
