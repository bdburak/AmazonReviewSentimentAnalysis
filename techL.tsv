The DVD player constantly gives ""Bad Disc"" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc.

I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration	0

I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products	0
It worked much better than expected. The page clips also were very good, but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item (I put it back on, but fell off a couple more times). I also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well.	1
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters	0
"It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me.

"I've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer. The monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is ONE thing that stands out here above all the other remotes. Wireless control over lighting. I replaced my dimmers and switches with the Monster dimmers and switches and now I can control every light in my house. Monster really doesn't talk much about this feature but being able to hit ""ALL OFF"" at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer. You can even map ligthing scenes to activities. If you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time. Really cool. Good job monster."	1
"No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?

Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product.."	0
"I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.

It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6"" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  

This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. "	1

"After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them.

1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal.
2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak.
3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower.
4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod"	1

"I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, ""It must be your computer."" did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.

When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one	0
"I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.

The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is ""PowerChute Personal Edition"" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the ""Power"" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference.

In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the ""surge only"" outlet row.

When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into ""hibernation mode"", saving the desktop exactly ""as is"" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly.

If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks."	1

I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times.

We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up	0
"What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference.
The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost.
The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools.
The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher"	1

In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic	0

"Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. "	0
"This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably.

The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine.

This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green).

This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it"	1
"Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues

Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.

This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for ""X-Fi popping/crackling"".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial ""hacked"" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the ""the fastest sound processor"" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. 

Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.

UPDATE 06/12/2006
I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)"	0
The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk	1
"About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.

In this day & age of ""just make the item"" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages	0
"I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).

I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.

- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).

"I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.

I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.

To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.

I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.

For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.

Not a quality reader.

Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.

Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. ""Eject"" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.

If you own a Canon digital camera this printer is great.  It is portable and makes great prints.  People think they are from a photolab.  It is also vey easy to use.  I have seen other mini printers from Olympus and Sony and they are not as good.  They cost more too	1

"I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Monster Cable.  I must say that I am quite impressed.  This is the best FM transmitter I have encountered.

I live in Seattle.  There is a fairly saturated FM dial, and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals.  That said, I only have minor problems with interference, the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges.

Functionality is pretty much seamless in my car.  I drive a 2003 Ford Focus.  The 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash CD changer, so accessibility is not an issue.

"Title: Intuos3 Tablet
Publisher: Wacom
Publish Date: Unknown
ISBN/Model #:  PTZ631W
Reviewer: Robert Saucier
Rating: 5 stars

In 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz Pentium II system, I splurged on a Wacom ArtZ II tablet.  Oh, my!  Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven.

After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive.  I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats.

Sadly, I disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away.  Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse.  Miraculously, a Wacom Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped, almost literally, into my lap.  Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted Pilot G2 pens) AND a mouse!  Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities:  Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE.  Heaven just got better!

The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the Wacom Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better tablet to application response.  One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else.  The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me.  I've used all of my ""usual"" programs and have had no problems at all.  The tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus.

The Intuos3 has 8 ""chordable"" buttons, 4 at each side of the tablet, to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned.  The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with ""space"".  The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet, holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand.  Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well.  The default setting is to scroll or depending on the context.  The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros.  The pen, with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus AND ""eraser,"" also has a DuoSwitch.  The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed.

The pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback.  With the ergonomic grip, the pen is extremely comfortable to hold.  The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either ""righties"" or ""lefties,"" is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable.  As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the ""fix photo,""  ""illustrate article,"" or even the ""design website"" settings.

I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product.  I would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen.  It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me.  The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II).  Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time.

For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable.  For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment.  It's great to be in Heaven again ..."	1
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	0
I bought the Sansa M240 two months ago and am quite happy with it. It's light-weight, holds plenty of media (I have yet to fill it up) and the sound is suprisingly good. No complaints	1
The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy	0
"The other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42"" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out.  Any tips"	1
Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform	0
"I bought this item, since I always make a lot of notes from books and other papers, and don't want to type it in manually anymore. This scanner, probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing!
I dont use the addressbook or options with your GSM but they are no doubt very handy.
I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type!
The dictionary also comes in very handy.

It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work!
So buy one and save some time! Excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes, or studies, or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g"	1

"I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.  

The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.

The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.

1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.

2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making ""S"" sounds sound more like ""H"" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.

3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).

I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs. "	0

" I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!

I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.

I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.

The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.

Infocus says ""sometimes this happens"".

They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-""It is out of warranty"", ""sometimes this happens"", ""1400 hours is just what some lamps get"", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.

I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.

They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.

Don't buy Infocus!!!"	0

it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since
my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at 
the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints"	0
Just wanted to echo what others have said, that these batteries seem to really last.  I received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it, almost as powerful as the 2500s here, and the batteries ran out after a few hours.  Replaced those batteries with these, and these just seem to last on and on.  Am very happy with them	1
"I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.

Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem"	0
You really can't go wrong with this one.  Not great response but what do you expect for less than $300?  On the other hand, The possibilities for this surround system are endless.  Want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen?  How about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system, (this is how my daughter has it configured).  It's our second one.  First one died as a result of recent electrical storm, (Yes the circuit was 'protected', but so what).  Couldn't be happier for the investment	1

So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so"	0
"The service from Amazon was great, delivery people were most cooperative, made delivery as promised, placed TV in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out.

"If you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the Sony HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room.

Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though.
If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well.

Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can't be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8"" subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $200. It isn't powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. 

The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn't be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all.

Basically, if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the Sony HT-DDW70"	1
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else	0
"I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).

PLUSES: 
decent sound
good functionality
easy set-up and intuitive operation
simple remote -- but only covers basic functions

CONS:
very short speaker leads
unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox
only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units

At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.

I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality"	1
"I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0

"You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.

1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!

2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.

3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!

4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible

5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the ""biamping"" type of connections.

6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.

"After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a ""skin"" type case for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses.

Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-case approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there.

This jacket is a winner"	1
"The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is ""admin"". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.

The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang).

We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni	1

Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!"	0
I am extrememly happy with this one.  For the price, it delivers well.  The voice recorder works well.  My key need was to record lectures and listening to them.  Worked out very well	1
This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment	0

"Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. 

I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very ""tiny"" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player."	0
"I have two seperate units.  One hardwired to my car, and the other is the JVC unit.  I hooked it directly into the audio (aux) ports of my Radio, rather than use an fm station.  It works great, the sound quality is excellent as well - (and my radio is so old it play's 8-tracks!!!!).  I did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot.  I agree with the previous reviews, that it is something that JVC needs to look into, perhaps it is simply a matter of a ""heat sink-er"" not being in specs, as yet, I have encountered no problems (having had the JVC unit for 1.5 years)  No matter.  As to the commercial free: Sirius (which I have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free radio, though the news stations and a few others do have commercials.  Those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block.  The music stations are 100% free of commercial. 

All in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating DJ's, commerical's, and lack of variety in stations!  ~Cheers!"	1

I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.

Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements	1
"I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.

I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?

"I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).

The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it."	1
Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.

I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure.

"I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. 

To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable"	1
"This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.

Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.

"This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk"	1

" I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true. 
 My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster. 
 One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me.
 I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none."	1
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.

I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem	1
"When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.

I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?

"Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.

When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.

Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.  

The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.

As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.  

Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value."	1
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate.

Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it.

"I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.

I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally."	0
I purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem. I use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far. Highly recommend this product	1
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.	0
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 	1
I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.	0
"My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon.  My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD.  It kept saying ""please check disc"".

The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk.	0

"Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.
My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again"	1
"Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.

But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.

"After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.

I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.

I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.

What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.

I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended	1
But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please	0
"This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32"" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars"	1

the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie"	0

This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. 
I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.
I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.

" I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!

I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.

I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.

The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.

Infocus says ""sometimes this happens"".

They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-""It is out of warranty"", ""sometimes this happens"", ""1400 hours is just what some lamps get"", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.

I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.

They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.

"This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.

If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good."	0

This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set.

I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market.

My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength"	1

"You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!  

To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.  

The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.  

Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product!

Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product:

First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows:
1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.  
2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows:
- all three plug into the ""video out"" column
- all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.  
3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer.

Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows:
- ""NTSC M"" for the video standard setting
- ""640 x 480"" and ""60 FPS (VGA)"" for video format
- ""DVD, VCR, TV"" for video source
- ""Video composite"" for video input

Under the program advanced settings:
- Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)
- CPU support: ""SSE3""
- Stereo system: ""MTS""
- Video decoder: ""video standard: NTSC_M""

Under properties within the program advanced settings:
- Stream format:  Video format: ""NTSC_M""
- Frame rate: ""59.940""
- Color space/compression: ""YUY2""
- Outputs size: ""640x480""

Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.)

In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows:
Under ""File,"" click on ""capture video.""

Use the following settings:
- audio device set at: ""USB2.0 Analog Audio Device""
- Video input source set at: ""Composite""
Under Configure Video Capture Device:
- Video format: Video standard: ""NTSC_M""
		   Frame rate: ""29.970""
		   Color space/compression: ""YUY2""
		   Output size: ""640x480""

Under Camera settings:
- Deinterlace method: ""Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)""
- CPU support: ""SSE3""
- Stereosystem: ""MTS""

Under Video decoder: Video standard: ""MTSC_M""
Signal detected: ""1""
Lines detected: ""525""
Then...

Give the file a name and indicate where to save it

Set it for ""best quality"" for playback.

Then ""Start Capture.""

If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound.

I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried.  Completely unusable.  The software is a trial version.  Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more.  Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture.  Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy	0

I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out.	1
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS	0
I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well	1
"I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting ""card error"" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke"	0

I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 	0

"This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the ""hold"" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano"	0
"(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)

Major modes of operation are:

1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)
2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)
3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)
4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a ""virtual"" cable; you need two to get the job done)

A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.

I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.

1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!
2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is ""admin"". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.
3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this"	1
"The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is ""admin"". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.

The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine"	0
"This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.

That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed"	1

"I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option.  It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel.  I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life.  The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.  I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train.  The sound quality is very good.  I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far.  The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue.  The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway.  They do sound good though.  Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.

A little hint:  One thing I did not like was that because of the location of the on button, the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket.  To combat this, simply turn the Hold on.  The unit won't turn on accidentally when it's on"	1

"Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.

As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.

Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..

Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok.

"When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it.

The card works fine in my phone, and since I have a USB cable that hooks up to the phone, I don't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader. I have not yet experienced any problems with Sandisk memory products.

I am told that the Sandisk sticks are faster than Sony's, but I have no way to confirm this, nor do I know if my phone (mp3 player, camera) is able to take advantage of faster speeds. The longest process is transferring music to the phone, and I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

This stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format, so I can use the 128mb stick that I replaced in my Sony Camcorder (which had a 4mb stick in it. No, it's not a typo. It's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick)"	1

"Okay,

This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly
encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are
really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. 

If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) 

They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)

Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.

"I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got ""CF card error"" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.

After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent ""CF card error"" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.  

One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.

For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range	1

"I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done.

I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said &quot;it IS ON!!&quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing	0

Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for	0
"I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.  

Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. "	1

"The Good:
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. 

The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.

The Bad:
The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The ""Windows Keyset"" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). 

In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little ""cheap"" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.

The Ugly:
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.

I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are ""reviewing my warranty"" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.

Conclusion:
The expression ""Great Idea, Bad Execution"" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good"	0
I bought this because I did not want to mount my Garmin 350 Nuvi to the windshield. This device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars. I drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard. I can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too. Please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag & mounting arm separately	1

"I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)  

Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.  

The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.  And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal.  Great product"	1
The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine	0

I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charge. The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each. I also have several high end chargers that don't want anything to do with the ones that died. On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A+ after 2+ years	0
I got this on sale for $80 and i love it. It holds about 300 songs, gets plenty loud, has amazingly good battery life, and takes all my abuse. I play it at least 2 hours a night, if not all night, its my alarm in the morning, i listen to it in the car, on the bus, before school, during lunch, ok how bout his i use it a ton. I never leave home without it its small, easy and comfortable to hold, and it wont die if you drop it. Wiht my previous player I had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other players but this one hasn't let me down yet. O & one big plus the battery back is attached so it will never dissapear	1
O.k., I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now.  These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives.  I don't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is, but these didn't last being on the shelf for a little over a year.  I will never buy this brand again	0
I bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it's worked beautifully. Clear and easy to use. Once downloaded onto my computer I used the Olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews. This allowed me to listen on headphones, control the progression (and backtracking)of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly. This voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time I had to take trascribing the interviews. Well worth the price. I'd recommend this combo highly, especially to other journalists.	1
To be short, the performance is less than great but OK, but I can live with that since I have dozens of them, I don't care if it runs out faster.

I've been very pleased with this external drive-500GB. My only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it.

I don't use 800 yet so I need to daisy it off of my SmartDisk FireLite that happens to have 2. All in All-Get this drive	1
"I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red ""battery"" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed.
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be.
My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk"	0
Solid product.  Headphone/speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted $40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed!  I bought this great little unit instead for under $30.

This is our first LCD TV.  Our tube TV finally died.  My wife actually picked out this unit and Consumer Reports also recommended this unit.  We purchased it directly from AMAZON on January 23, 2007.  I wanted to wait a couple of months before I write my review to see if anything happens. But to my surprise the TV is still running and there have been no problems.  We have digital HD and the pictures are great.  It took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast.  However, if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat.  But overall its a good buy for us	1
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 	0
"I researched TVs for a long time before I ended up buying this set.  It helped that Costco offered a coupon for $300 off the price ($1000 final price).   I thought I may not like the TV, so I decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return.  However, there is no way I am returning this TV; it's awesome.  The picture is great, and that is just with SD.  The Strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored.  I was worried about buying the 37"" TV and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion.  But there is no need with this TV since Sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion.  DVDs look incredible on this TV as well.   What is even better is the built-in HD tuner.  I was debating upgrading my cable to the HD package, but I decide to spend $13 on ""rabbit ears"" from Target.  Oh my, once I plugged in the indoor antenna and let the TV track for digital stations I was amazed.  The analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter, but when I went up to the HD digital companion station, I couldn't believe my eyes.  An incredible HD picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk...indoors no less!   Why would I upgrade my cable TV to the HD package when they can't offer the local stations in HD?  Especially when they are FREE with a simple antenna!  I was told this was possible, but quite frankly I was skeptical.  Not anymore, I am so glad I got the Sharp that has the built-in tuner.  I seriously considered just buying the HD ready TV monitor and upgrade through my cable provider.  Boy am I glad that I didn't do that.  If you are in the market for a very nice TV that is easy to use and provides a great picture, I would highly recommend this set. "	1
There are brands I trust and ones I don't.  Sony has always been a trusted brand.  But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken.  I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase, but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product.  The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews: When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer.  I am hoping I have better luck.	0
"This is a great product. It was easy to mount and looks great. The only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall, but from what I have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches. I have a 32"" LCD mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so I always try to keep it closer to the wall, but every time I come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. This hasn't caused any problems and I'm sure this is well within its design strength.

I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk	0
"This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32"" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions.

"Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes.

As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing. 

Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough"	0
One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.

I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call.

Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare, and even at 3-5feet from the AP the unit is around 11-36mpbs.

Do not buy this product, find another company who stands behind there products. All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India. People on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke. Latest firmware fixes none of the problems"	0
"Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate.

So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****"	1
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again	0
I have this radio for two weeks now.  I am very satisfied with the reception of AM, FM and Short Wave -- very sensitive.  Has great sound.  The only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations.  Would buy the radio again - worth the money	1
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  Don't buy this item.  I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here	0

I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years.  While some Linksys units have worked for me, more often I have found them undependable.

"     This card, using VIA's superb Envy24 HT chipset, is a huge improvement over my Realtek and VIA Envy24HT-S based cards.  Everything sounds better.  

     My old Audigy 2 platinum (which I think I shall melt) did better in 3D games, but only slightly. Since this card doesn't snap, crackle, and pop like the Creative cards do, I'll venture to say that it actually DOES make games better, since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game.

     PROS:
* Very high audio sampling rates, allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm, rich, warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs.
* No crackling, popping, or hissing!  A real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why Creative Labs cards keep doing this.
* Well-maintained, solid drivers.
* Supports EAX 2.0
* Excellent ASIO support.

     CONS:
* No hardware support for DirectSound; however, if your machine is faster than about 1GHz, you probably won't notice the difference.  Benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware DirectSound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed.
* Only supports up to EAX 2.0, due to Creative Labs refusing to license the technology.  Sound difference is minimal, though"	1

I'm using this Monster cable to connect my iPod to my receiver via an iPod dock and it works flawlessly.  Sound is crisp and clear.  Plus, it's a lot cheaper than getting the actual Monster iPod AV cable.  The length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome.  It's a great way to increase the functionality of your iPod	1
I bought this HD because my Lacie (which had lasted over 5 years) crashed on me finally. So I figured I would try a different company. Out of the box this  product looked great, although it was very large and heavy. I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted. I tried several more times and it wouldn't boot up. VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won't boot up out of the box. I don't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data. Going back to Lacie	0

I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :&lt;..	0
"I ordered a pair of these online, a bit nervous as I wasn't ever able to hear them (I heard a pair of JBL SP6C's, the cheaper version, at Best Buy, and wasn't all that impressed, although it might have been the poor listening environment).  

Anyway, the speakers arrived, we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and I'm quite impressed.  Note that we're using these for ""whole-house"" background music, not home theater, so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the HT case.  But for a 6.5"" speaker, these put out a surprising amount of bass, and clear highs.  Right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one, and they still sound great.  These probably would be just fine for HT rear-speaker use (I wouldn't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center HT use).

Our home theater downstairs already has JBL speakers (studio series for the fronts and center, northridge for the rears) and I've been very happy with them.  

I recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank. "	1
DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA.  SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade (save for the Windows startup music).

"Bought 2 of these to watch over my house while I am at work.  Setup is pretty easy, but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings, many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart.  Camera's work great together and the free use of [...] to access the cameras is nice.  Setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right.

Pros: Price is good for a ip camera with tilt/pan.  viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the camera package.  Works great with similar model panasonic cameras.

Cons: Multiple restarts while setting up or making changes(minor issue), limited online support/how-to's"	1

"The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly.
I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen"	1
"The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks. I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised. once I got the tv up it is ok, and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should  for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady. I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks. I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement. Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating.

"These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media I've EVER encountered! They're made by CMC Magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world. But not only are they CMC Magnetics, they're the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics!

The latest KProbe *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The latest Nero Burning ROM *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The program continues, non-stop, to display ""waiting for media"" when I use these, and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe.

Curiously, the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CD-R media (they're made by CMC Magnetics as well). However, at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware, quite unlike the Verbatims. That's why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics. (The Philips are no prize, either, but they perform minimally well).

The *ONLY* thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling.  But what's the point of labeling discs you can't even RECOGNIZE, let alone burn?

I had the exact same problems with these media in both my Lite-On LH-201AH burner and my NEC ND-2510A burner (the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media).

Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. But, stupidly, they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp. Thus, they lost all credibility!

I was unsure of whether to purchase this product when I saw that my printer (HP Deskjet 712C) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews, I tried it anyway because the price was right.  It may look a little cheesy but it works.  I didn't even need the CD that comes with it in order to use the product.  I just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new Dell laptop and it worked.  I think I may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it.  Very good product	1
YMMV, but my 80GB drive died after 6 months.  I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home, but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of.  I'm glad I back up my data in more than one place	0

"This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. 

The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.

The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost. 

I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.

Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.

I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.

If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out ""paperless"" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed. 

Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality."	0

"This product is a sad joke.  It's expensive of course.  The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board).  But, whatever.  

However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.  What kind of company would sell such a product?

I bought this product mainly for my girlfriend to use on my computer. I find myself using it most of the time, now!  The mouse is great, lost of extra buttons on it (not that I need them, but it makes it a little more convenient in case I do.)  The Keyboard is great...lots of shortcut buttons right on the keyboard, making navigation VERY easy.  A couple of features on the keyboard I really like are the scroll whell on the left, the favorites buttons (all customizable, as are all the shortcut buttons on this keyboard) and the very comfortable hand rest.  I got this refurbished and it works like new!  I HIGHLY suggest this.  The only drawback is that it is a little bigger than I would have liked, but I don't mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend.

"This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.  
 
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday. 
 
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, ""SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers.""

My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that ""cr*p"", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address!
 
All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer"	0

"This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. 

A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for ""ON"" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be.

"I had an old Palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer. But it ate batteries and wasn't rechargeable, so when I got a newer computer without a serial port (and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-USB connector), I decided to upgrade. Thought it'd be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well, (I don't own an iPod or other small mp3 player) but I didn't need many features beyond an organizer (didn't need for e-mail, etc) and didn't want to spend much over $75. 

Pros: 
I like the Palm interface, very intuitive.
Calendar & contacts work well
Plays mp3's
Syncs well with Outlook/computer
Plugs in to recharge; all cords came with it.
Easy to download new software (I recommend Blocks, it's similar to Tetris)

Cons or caveats:
Display: when viewing calendar in ""full month"" mode, I have trouble seeing any entries unless I view the screen at an angle. Not a deal-breaker, but a little odd. They probably improved this with newer (pricier) models, but you get what you pay for. I can read all other screens just fine.
Haven't used it to display photos; I don't think I'd use this to do that--resolution isn't worth the effort.
Expansion card: WARNING: WILL NOT READ ANY CARD OVER 1GB size! (I had purchased a 2GB card with the intent of putting mp3's on it and listening to them on the Zire. Wouldn't read it. Didn't realize this till I read the fine print. Fortunately, I have a camera which takes SD cards so I can use in the camera).
Listening to mp3's: This really isn't gonna replace an iPod for features. They do say that listening to mp3's uses more battery than other functions. I would agree but then I've not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player, so I can't really say. Functionally, mp3's play just fine with RealOne player. Sound quality is pretty good BUT I have noticed a ""hiss"" background noise when using earbud-style headphones; it's a lot less noticeable with ""outside-the-ear"" style headphones. Recommendation: outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line (cord) volume control. If you're in a quiet environment, the lowest volume level on the RealOne player isn't all that soft. With non-volume-adjustment headphones, the lowest volume level (there's a slider bar on screen) was the loudest I wanted to hear. Headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem.

Overall, it's been worth the $$ for me as a replacement for my former m100, and it works ok as an mp3 player, as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis"	1
"There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. 

There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.

Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetooth
works well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.

But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really 
doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.

This arm-band is surprisingly good.  I initially got it for my boyfriend for his iRiver, but I was afraid it wouldn't fit his arms since he's very muscular.  Surprisingly - it stretched enough and wasn't tight!  He loves it.  I thought there might be too much motion on mine when I run or use the eliptical, but no, it's fine	1
"First T5 lasted 6 months, then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty. This one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty. The third T5 lasted about 5 months. It's now out of warranty and won't start or reset. No - I'm not rough on my PDAs. None of them got even as much as a scratch. Each one looked like new when it ""broke"". The first 2 times, Palm told me the ROM had failed. I guess it's the same problem again, but I'm not spending $169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5. Good bye Palm.

Out of the box I think it's a good PDA, so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy"	0

"I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.

However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are ""uncomfortable as sin"". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. 

If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere.."	0
This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	1

"A couple years ago I got a projector for the ""big screen effect"", and decided to finally get my mini Advents out of storage for the surround sound. My OLD Pioneer receiver worked ok, but I decided it was time to upgrade. I have 30 year old Speaker Lab (build 'em yourself) speakers up front with the Advents in back.
The only complaint I have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table (yes, I'm old). So I kept the Pioneer for dedicated service to the record player.
I have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school. For him it's a breeze. I don't even look at the directions. I just say ""here"".
Having said that; I think this thing is great! If you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system, you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system (WOW) for your records and cassettes. Ahh.... technology.
I love this thing! I can understand that some folks want something better, but for 95% of us, this will be the last one you will ever need.

"I just got mine from Amazon (after a lengthly delay).  It is an awesome memory card.  It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras.  I tested it on the camera and it worked great.  The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP.  No issues there.   The card worked flawlessly.  I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy!

Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers.   btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.  They credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay.  Overall great service too."	1
I bought this card and the Belkin Pre-N wireless router in Nov. 2006 at a BestBuy store during Thanksgiving sale. The router worked but the card did not. I called Belkin many times. Everytime they asked me to re-install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked. I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again. Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement. I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs. I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive	0
I use this 1GB card in my Sony Playstation Portable, and it is awesome!  The tranfer rate using the USB 2.0 cable to the PSP is very good, and I love having all that storage space for movies, music, and images.  I got the Ultra II because I had read that Sandisk outperformed Sony in speed tests, and I have to agree.  The tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32MB Sony card that came with the PSP.  For an extra $5-$10 I got the Ultra II that has a warranty and better performance.  I think it is well worth it	1

The first one I ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the USB devices I was plugging into it.  Although I had considered just getting a refund, Amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles.  The replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now.

This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy.  Problem is, it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting!  We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem.  So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask.  Not a great way to do it (and just asking to be seeded by bacteria), but if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm all for it, even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..	0

"O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box. 

Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little"	0

"There are some things I like about this, others I don't. Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers.

Likes:
1. Small, easy to use
2. Good sound quality
3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers.
4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in WMP, but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier.
5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company.

Dislikes:
1. The shuffle mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential playlist, and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats.
2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista.
3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player.
4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy.
5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important.
6. You can't view your photos while you are listening to music. Sometimes this sucks, but if you have a camera phone, or are in an actual conversation with someone, you probably won't be listening to your music anyway."	1

"I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.

  First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.  

  I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.

  I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.

  I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.

  1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.

  2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh!
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.

My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!

My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.

Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.

One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.

And I was right....I should have passed on this.  It was a pain to configure, and then none of the settings would stick.

"The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking.

I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality.

Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI. 

One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs.

There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players.

Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then"	1

These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else	1

I have seen the sprays, I have seen the wipes, I have seen the low grade sandpaper product, I have tried using BRASSO metal polish (a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from Venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works) and low-grade industrial solvent. HANDS DOWN, short of the industrial strength polishing machines (that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $1500 to over $5000), SKIP DR (and all its incarnations GAME DR / DVD DR / PHOTO DR) WORKS. Period.


Why did I only rate the product '4 stars'?

Simple: this review is about the mechanical version of the product. And I am lazy: mechanised means EFFORT. 


Will I buy the mechanised version?

Definitely! The product is in my shopping basket will be ordered (when I finish writing this review to set the record straight!"	1
"I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?

For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a ""visit"" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32"", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.

So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).

I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you."	0
They say it's quiet, and it holds tons of data.  They were correct.  Fast access speed, easy installation, an overall fine product.  Have not used the feature that let's you back-up your entire drive, but we use it in our LAN for shared files, and it's comforting to know that we've got these files stored redundantly.  This box does just what it claims to do, the warranty of merchantability (from my old law class!).	1

"The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way.

Other than that flaw, whioh I hope they fix with a software update, I highly recommend this product, it all other ways it is great"	1
"I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.  

Save yourself some frustration and get something better.  iriver maybe?  Just stay away from Creative Lab products. "	0
Buying from Amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping.  Stepped up for more power per channel.  Stayed in the Sony family. (Previous Sony surround, output to center speaker quit)  Dislike the speaker hook ups in back, difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections.  Overall happy with purchase	1
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it.  It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months.  The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to.  Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC.  Customer service? Don't count on it.  So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product. 	0
Very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use.  Before purchasing, I did believe that these were noise canceling.  However, that is not the case.  The foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that I am very satisfied with the result.  Replacement foam inserts must be purchased online	1
"Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT!

"According to other reviews, this radio compares favorably with others in its price class.

As a ham radio operator I can say I am very happy with the E5.  It is the best portable Broadcast band radio I have ever had.

It is the best portable Shortwave radio I have ever had.

I was particularly interested in SSB capability.  It works well.


I called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement.  I use 2100 mah Nimh batteries which I charge externally.  I have two sets.  The radio works well with these.

I found that the internal antenna by itself, indoors, is not enough.  I used the included wire antenna with moderately good results.  But more convient is using the telescoping antenna.  This antenna works, according to the manual, for FM and SW only, but I found that extending it fully, is effective in all cases.  Ressults using this method were similar to the wire.

Holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception.

Hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver.  There are limits to what is possible in a package this size.  I have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna.

For what it is, this is a great tool.  It is a convient size and easy to program and use.  It more than meets my expectations.

I bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.  These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs	1
This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less (see Logitech website). I just received my Amazon Order  and it was serial number R635. It will be sent back tomorrow. Hopefully, Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own, rather than relying on its customer base	0
"The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.

I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.

No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod."	1
"These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant. The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as ""surround sound"" (yeah right...) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers."	0
I lost my Monster Cable brand M to M cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price...plugged everything in and it works super-good sound quality and saved some bucks.  Hard to find these cables, so I highly recommend it	1
"Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal.

I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter."	0
I saw the small size of this case and was in love.  It has plenty of space for dvds and cords (though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold).  It is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky.  It's Great.  You wont regret it. 	1
Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected	0
"Great Price! Cant compare it to the more expensive ""monster cables"" but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components"	1
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well	0
For its price and definately for its length, its an awesome alternative to it's $100 monster counterpart	1

This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!	0
when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds	1
This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse.  I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor.  This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it	0
I really needed a printer with a scanner so I could store my important files digitally.  This printer works great.. I would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster.

I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  The unit has a very cheap feel, especially for the price.  I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.  Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months?  In short, this product is crap.  I might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less	0
Good product, great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad.	1
"Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working. 

Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.

I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution"	0
"This is my second projector - I used an NEC for the last four years, but that died on me recently.  And, boy, am I glad it died - I am amazed by the quality of the AX100U - the pictures and colors almost  jump off the screen at you.  Also, the oft mentioned LDC projector 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it.  I believe Panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it.  The contrast is also truely outstanding for an LCD projector - at par with DLP systesm, but without the headaches of the rainbow effect.

Couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users.  When I first started using the projector with my DVD player I was getting some wavy curls (not too visible, but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen.  However, after about 4-5 hours of use, they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls, just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well.

Secondly, unlike my old NEC I was getting a flickering shimmer when using my HD box from my cable company.  The shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture.  There is an easy fix for this.  Go to options, overscan, and you can actually crop the edge of the image and  not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture. 

Be aware that this is big, bulky projector compared to some others out there.  Definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures.  This was designed as a dedicated home theater projector, not a portable presentation device.  

I highly recommend this projector - you've got to see the picture to believe it - I didn't think it was possible at this price range."	1
Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months.  The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights.  Poor product Netgear	0
"I was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies.  Hearing is believing.  It gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that I simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub I had purchased.  For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy.  It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market.  I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls.  I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could.  I was able to do so with the addition of this sub.  I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering.

Yet I hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub.  Its Peak Dynamic Power is 250 watts.  But the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier.  Therefore, it is a 150-watt sub"	1
"I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.

Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was ""within specifications"" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.

For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.

Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.

The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.

If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.

I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.

To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where ""Home"" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.

The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.

On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.

In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.

I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road. 

On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. 

On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files"	0
"Pros: Very inexpensive, can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 player
Cons: Can't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash drive

Overall I'm very happy with this device. I live in a big city and had no trouble finding an FM station with little to no interference. I love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time. The sound quality is good, but not perfect. Similar to playing a cassette instead of a CD. For the low price, I can't complain, though"	1
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with HD (5 LNB) and the signal was low. Signal was less than 60% for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD. So I bought these to amplify my satellite signal.  They actually attenuated the signal. The signal strength wasn't improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well. It didn't matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver.	0
I purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote.  Before buying it I checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo.  This was the only one that definitely could. It has worked well...a couple features are not available but I expect that with any replacement control.  I've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine.  Now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered	1
"The headphones sound great--no arguement there.  However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke.  The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck.  Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.

Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times"	0
I bought this card to be used with an IPAQ HW6945 it has enough capacity for GPS maps, programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from Sandisk that is supported by the IPAQ. The reading / writing speed is ok too. Very good product for only 18 bucks	1
"Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set ""numbered"" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a ""null"" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead.

This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode.

After buying this product, I opened the case after few days, as I was out of country, to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices. However every time I put it in the camera or other devices, it gives error and doesn't work.

"I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad. 
     It is simply the best mouse pad I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on  the wrist rest. The pad actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed! "	1
"After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my ""M"" tape was providing. I opted for this ""TZ"" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to ""narrow"". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the ""narrow"" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another ""great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so.

"We bought this phone two years ago.  While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable.  The problems we've had are listed below:

*very short battery life for the handsets
*the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use
*the handsets go ""out of range"" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big)
*the handsets randomly become ""unregistered"" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)

The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years"	0

I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them.	0

"I gave a detailed review of the base system, but the handset merits comments separately.  I have purchased handsets for every room in the house, and because I don't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere, I use them.  They're easily customizable through the PC interface, although they can be customized without it as well.  Each handset gets its out name, so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple.  (No more trying to remember which room has the ""fifth"" handset.)  I've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset; I've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality, but I've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios.  If you're shopping for one of these, then you've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it, so you know the quality to expect.

I exchange audio letters with friends, and this stereo recorder was purchased after my Sony 100 DVS died and no replacement parts were available. The sound quality is perfectly fine, though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine. It comes with a stereo microphone, but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is, there is a long clip-on cord. This makes it tough to do ""off-the-cuff"" recording.

We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position.

"So this controller looked pretty sweet to me so I bought it over a rumble pad. I liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat, as I tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. I bought this controller specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style controller that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 controller.

The only things I think are bad about it are the following:
1. It is not modeled on the large XBox controller, but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long.
2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard.
3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die.

Overall, a great controller, I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here"	1

"Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer.

 I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here.
 You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS.
 
I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.
And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to.
 one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.
20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.

Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!

In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.
Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on.
 
It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" or, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb.
 
With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the ""BASS"" button: if the button is in the ""music"" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the ""movie"" position (I think ""music"" is a flatter frequency response).
 As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:
yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.
It's a absolute pleasure to listen to.


Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.
If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.
Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review"	1

I can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire. This size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers. I am using this wire with a Samsung HT-Q80 HTIB. It's working wonderfully and I'm getting nice crisp sound. Unlike the other reviewer, my spool came fully intact. I would suggest this for anybody looking for good, cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire	1
According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked.

The March 2007 released Vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games.  Check Nvidia's message board for more info.)

Once Nvidia straightens out their Vista drivers issues, this card will be golden.  As it is, the latest Beta drivers did improve performance... but it introduced some stability issues.

Also, EVGA's 90-day Step-Up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-April 2007.

LASTLY... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3D games and when resizing windows.  I returned one (with green circuitboard) and got a new one form Amazon (black circuitboard) and it did the same thing.  Amazon reimbursed me the return shipping!  The digital whine isn't too bad, but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low.  I play with headphones, so I don't really care"	1
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy	0
This is a great little machine and has so many uses.  I bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to Amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled... what's with that?  Keep looking and you'll find this at a hot price again eventually	1
This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	0
Never having had any other headphones I don't really know how to compare these, but the speakers definetely work fine and I can identify different directions' sounds... but there is a small crackling in the background that won't go away and I can't find out why	1

As headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design.  After the 10th time the Microphone failed entirely and refuses to work.  I've isolated the problem to the microphone itself.  As headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere.  	1

"In general, Lexar's USB drive does its job just as well as other USB drives; there isn't much of a difference except for the following:

1) portability 
good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain
bad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months)

2) it is extremely durable. This drive survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. When I took it out of the washer, I thought all the data and the drive was gone for good. To my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. This is amazing!

I have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine.

Finally, I have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine.

3) looks:
good: it is very easy to see since it is bright red
bad: it is fatter than other USB drives and it is bright red. The drive is pretty ugly.

It maybe good to note however, that the drive's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. The bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above"	1
"Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.

"It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC. 
I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it.

Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux.  I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux.  My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go.  Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues.  Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box. 	0

I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!!

"I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer.  Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited.  My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.

I would not have bought it had I known this.  I have not used the GPS since I bought it.  It will probably be tossed out.

The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package.  So you don't see it prior to opening the package.  Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned.

Lastly, this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen.  The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors.  The cut plastic is also dangerous"	0

I have this radio and it's a POS. Remote isn't very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright (will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person) and the user interface is terrible.

"I bought this alarm clock today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10.  I wish I had seen the reviews first.  I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options.  Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on.  The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn't stay in place.
   The clock light is pointless.  It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry.  Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions  even with the light off.
   As for the alarm, it's pretty quiet.  If you're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment, this is not the clock for you.  You'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear.
  A final note on this product: The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the battery cover slightly open.  If I close the cover all the way, the clock shuts off.  If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else.  You get less than you pay for with this model."	0
"I have used this machine for a few months now, but have not made use of all possible features. However, this is what I can say:

* basic copying, fax, scanning -- Excellent
* scanning with character recognition -- Excellent but would prefer to have options ala OmniPage
* duplex printing(printing on both sides) -- Very Good, except the menu digging is ackward
* build quality and overall performace -- Excellent, prints fast, few jams, feels very sturdy
* ease of use -- very good and straight forward
* features -- Excellent, loaded with capabilities

This machine is beautiful and no other machine I have used comes close, save for high end office machines costing $thousands. I can't get over how happy I am with this one, I've been waiting for a quality MFC since before they came out, and finally I am satisfied. Highly recommended"	1

I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs).  It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit.  A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore.  When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution	0
"I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering.  I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12"" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since.

I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds.

I'm big on trying anything before I buy it.  I was able to listen to these and the E80s (the dual 6"" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued.  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question.  

The only issue was what model to get...
I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s.  The dual 6"" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side.  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed.  I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8"" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6"" for a bit less money.

Beautiful home theater and music speaker...
crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass.  They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be.  and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub.

Movies sound great:
Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc...
Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre):
Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock.
Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311.

If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it.
Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII.  you won't regret it.

I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.

"Like the name suggests, the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles.  I have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money.  The audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion.  I connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my Harman Kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear.  

The one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first.  However, when quality is essential go with the Audiophile 2496. "	1
"As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right.

"I have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in NYC (my home town) and traveling on business across the US.

A place for everything and everything in its place.
First this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th 'open' compartment; A padded laptop compartment large enough for a Mac 17"" with enough room left over of books or magazines. The second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel, that keeps your paperwork flat, orderly and compressed against your body(If you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is). The final main compartment contains an integrated open-top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear. Again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body. Each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose. The forth 'open' compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff: your book, newspaper, umbrella, rain jacket, lunch, magazine, camera, iPod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go. A great feature! Finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5  additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets AND: a separate gear bag, as well as a CD-ROM sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap.

The styling is professional enough of serious meetings. You can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle. This is key in elevators and subways.

All and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back. 

Final notes: 
- Zippers are high quality with big rubber grips
- The black & grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear.
- Fits snug under airline seats
- Good padding on shoulders and back panel.
- Did I mention all the pockets?

Any down side?
Having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats. 
When full this bag is BIG. But if you don't mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go. Other wise just limit your stuff."	1
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing. Showed it to a repair shop, says the fuser is a toast. Replacement cost part and labor $300.

"The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case.

My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video.  The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod.  A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen.  It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod.  A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket.  I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too	0
The cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the Airport Express.  This comes with a 2 meter RCA-ministereo, a 2 meter Optical-ministereo, and a 6ft power cable.  I found that both the RCA and Optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver.  I wish that the power cable was a little longer and I would've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set.  The installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some	1

"My engineering classes don't allow for the TI-83,86,89.  So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class.  The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class.  The ""2-Line Natural Textbook Display"" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have.  The ""scrolling"" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that I thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times, but that is because I'm used to square calculators.

This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again.

"This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day. 

Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.) 

The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash"	0
"I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion.

Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance.

The yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later. 

The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete. 

Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again.

To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber"	1
"I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's).

I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained.  Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.

This product works great for my ibook G4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case, although it seems like I'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen.

My 2 year old saw this in BJs and kept asking for it, so Santa brought it for him for Christmas. I think it's a good first guitar. He loves to strum it, but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument, not a toy. So far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine, but I don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. It is recommended for children much older than he is, so I can't expect anything different. I do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. For a better price than I see at Amazon, you can get a small Hohner guitar at a music store, which might be better quality, I'm not sure. Regardless, I am very happy with this guitar and I would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music. I would not buy it for a child just as a toy, unless you don't mind it being destroyed. I am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when I get it	1

Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 	0
The connectpro USB KVM Switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles.  I've been forced to use cheaper KVM switches at work and Windows XP never seems to play nice with them.  I use this one at home with two Linux machines and a desktop and laptop running Windows XP.  The switch worked the first time I connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since	1
This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.	0
Works just as expected.  Switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop (all running WinXP).  Each machine takes &lt; 1 min to recognize, same as when plugging in any new USB device.  Very durable cables.  Was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse, but works great with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop, including the multimedia function keys.  Version of the switch that I received is black, not white as pictured	1
I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had.  This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned.

"The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click ""end"" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer"	0
"I have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their Black and White desktop printer.  So far NOT ONE problem.  The toner is long-lasting and affordable.  Great quality- small desktop footprint.  Does a great job with envelopes, labels and even light cardstock.

This Eton radio is the U.S. domestic version of the Chinese Tecsun PL-550 all-band pocket sized radio. The Chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive. The Eton is, well, in English with slight curves. I have used and tested other Tecsun produced radios, including the PL-200 (Eton 10) and the Grundig eTraveller VII. This radio, like the other Tecsun models, has excellent frequency discrimination, as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it), or scan through the AM, FM and many shortwave bands, find the stations you like and store their frequencies. Closely allied, for example, FM stations within 200 kHz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial FM receivers) of each other, can be picked up with clarity, positioning the manuverable whip antenna. Very, very few radios, excepting expensive car radios, can boast such performance in the Unites States.  Now on the market are other comparable radios, all made by Tecsun in China using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers.  This model has other features as well:  two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations, scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts, some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping.  For the price, this radio is simply an excellent value, but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned:  shortwave reception from this radio, and every other shortwave radio for that matter, of stations other than the powerful broadcasters, benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna.  Tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the radio.  Alas, as with almost all radios this size, there is no single side band (SSB) reception, an enhancement that, defying digital technology, actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential, but has, for the present at least, been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information. The Dalai Lama for all his 5,000 watts SSB from Tibet can not be heard on this radio. China Radio shortwave, at 150,000 watts conventiona AM shortwave, with Canadian relay stations, does just fine. Australian radio, at the same power, Radio Havana, Radio Serbia, Croatia, Russia, Netherlands, Sweden, India, Israel, etc., at lesser power, and some with and most without relay stations, are also heard clearly on the Eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening EST"	1

"I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a ""Top of the line"" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only ""hit a triple""(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run"	1

"I only have a couple of problems with this remote. You have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd, vcr, audio, sat, etc. to change the setting. That sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and I am. (sue me. ha ha) The other is this. I bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working. I can't teach it the functions that I need through the ""learn"" command since the orginal remote quit. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote. I have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote wouldn't allow me to set the VCR clock and local channels after a power outage.

Actually, I loved the Philips Acoustic Edge, an earlier and internal sound card, but it did not like my older dual-processor system.  Because of that I was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which Windows treats as dual processors.  I bought the Aurelium instead.  I love this thing!  I am a bit of an audiophile, and this sound card is just perfect.  With my Klipsch computer speakers, it makes a perfect combination	1
"The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable.

The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems.

I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:

The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.  

All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.  

So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying ""I can't believe you Americans"" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.  

I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again. 

By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.  

Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.

I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.

"I just recently bought a sub-woofer and I spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect. The interconnects I looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap. I knew I wanted it to be THX certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement. This interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price. I must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice. 

Some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound. Wrong. This is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects. I do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs, but I do not buy into some of the hype surrounding Monster cable and their more expensive cables. 

Why only 4 and not 5 stars. I did not like the way the cable was packaged. The cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it. I would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable. 

Getting past that, its a good interconnect that produces great sound."	1

"This is actually the second RCDW500C I have purchased.  The first is still working, but it has so many miles on it that I wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced.  Sony electronics, in my experience, are some of the toughest in the business.  The old unit may last a lot longer.  I am on my third Sony TV in the last thirty five years; the second is still working for the person I finally gave it to.

I am very comfortable with the technology of the RCDW500C.  Once learned, this unit is a dream to operate.  It is user friendly, displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use.  If you have questioins, the manual is well written, and will usually enable the user to solve any problems.  Sony is a very reputable company.  In my humble opinion, Sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time.  Their products have always been a good investment for me."	1

The armband is well-constructed from a neoprene-type material (which doesn't slip when you're sweaty) with heavy-duty velcro all the way around, and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it.

I agree with the other review, Sony brand VHS tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years.  As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations	0

"I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC.  At first, one of sides was really weak in volume.  In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick.  Now both are equal, and sound good.  
There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft.  A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great.  After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.  They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before.  Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.

"We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7"" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.

-In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.

-It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!

I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key"	0
" I have just started with an Apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony. 
 
 I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same. 

 Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon"	1
"What were they thinking? Or Are they thinking at all? Sonic Stage is a piece of crap. It freezes, hangs and very very user friendly???? Since you need their software to load the music, I would stay away from this player as far away as possible. 

Pros: Nice sound quality. 
Cons: Everything else. 

My recommendation is go for Creative USB players. It's very good quality and better battary life. With Creative players, you just drag and drop files and you done with it.

It can transfer Flash drive & SD card to a car mp3 player. That's very nice. I love it..	1
"The software to this MP3 player made it too much work. Anything that freezes up my computer has to go. 

Here's my experience.

I purchased this player on February 23rd and returned it to the store on March 8th. I was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. I installed the software with no problem, but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. I just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. I did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. It had a very nice sound, easy to use and wonderful to carry around. I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge.

Fast Foward Week 2

I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to ""re-authorize"" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files.

In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the software I would have kept the player.

I've been in the newspaper business for many years, and I've always used recorders at governmental meetings, interviews, etc. -- much easier and faster than taking notes, and it allows me to focus more on my subject. Until now, I've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event. This little Sony is the perfect size, picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear. Additionally, it has a long battery life, and I never run out of room while I'm taping. I couldn't ask for more	1

unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated, this product stands in nearly every aspect. The sleek, supreme design by F.A. Porsche makes this product appearance timeless, and its preformance is outstanding, more effective in this model than its smaller, slower (80Gb, 120 Gb) counterparts. The autostart is a little slow for me (its the USB model, not firewire, remeber), but is a totally acceptable feature for the price, design & performance cost-benefit equilibrium. Excellent purchase	1
"Ok, so this is probably not the best protection for your iPod, but what do you want for 6 bucks? I'm cheap. If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps...

Pros:
- It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely.
- The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it.

Cons:
- The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers.
- The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck.
- It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries.
- This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top.

If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it"	0

The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best.

"The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The ""Piano Black"" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.

"This is perfect (so far) and exactly what I needed.  I have been looking for a new keyboard to work with my desktop, which sits right next to mu Polycom Conference Phone.

I spend a lot of time on the phone, so I want to be able to type without everyone on the call knowing it.  Perfect.  Setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a LogiTech prouct.  I had read these reviews and was prepared for a grueling install, but instead it happened so quickly I was right back to work fully functional.

Rarely do I write a review but this product is so bad I had to.  Expecting Sony electronics to perform well, what a disappointment, this one is a bummer.  Save your money.  There has got to a better under cabinet radio out there.  While the concept is good and the design sleek; don't be fooled by the packaging.  Nothing works well.  FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive.  To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted.  Forget listening to the rest of it.  This product is really ZERO stars.  I've tossed the whole works in the garbage	0
"I made the mistake to buy the Kensington laser pointer before this one. The Kensington is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. I to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the Kensington, together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. My kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the Hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it.

The wheel system of the Hiro presenter is very practical. Compared with my Kensington I found no difference in the quality of the laser: both do their job perfectly. The mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it. My unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both Mac an PC. Overall I am extremely satisfied. 

On the minus side, the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours. the ""fn"" label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage. A bit disappointing, but, after all, nothing really important. The unit also lacks programmable buttons, but I do not know any presenter with this feature. 

Bottomline. This presenter works well, it is not expensive, and the mouse control is a true must"	1

I bought this mouse about three months ago, and I love it.  It works on every surface, and the scroller works well too.  The only complaint I have is that the cord is rather short (about 2.5 feet long), and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop, which means that I only have about a foot to work with.  Although, I think that complaint can be shared equally with the Dell people for putting the USB port on the left (good deal for the left-handed population, I guess).  Some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled, but I haven't had any problems with that	1

"You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them.

The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.	0
"After installing the card, I booted up my Windows XP and it locked up.  After rebooting again, however, the card worked fine and has continued to work fine.

I've only had the card for two days, and so far I am very happy with it. Here's my setup: Windows XP Home Edition, Direct TV set-top box, and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card.  Since the set-top box is in the other room, I'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel.  A little tedious, but it's fine for recording a few shows.  I haven't tried the remote that came with the card (I assume it doesn't work through walls).

The WinTV 2000 software is not very user friendly, but I haven't found any bugs in it yet.

At the beginning, I really thought this is a very nice product. It does solve the CD organize and automatic storage problem for many people. However, this equipment is poorly engineered. I bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons. There is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units. If you ever think about move this equipment to another room, it is almost bound to fail. Customer service usually take 2 days to respond. The phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer. Imagining someone charges your $400 to organize 300+ CDs for a year and then quit. I am completely pissed off.	0

I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you.

"This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing.

I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console.

This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs.

The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections.

The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.  

There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself.

Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own.

Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output"	0

With all the reviews about how easy the Nano scratches, I left the protective film on until I found the right case the next day at CC (they had just received them that day), sorry Amazon but the Nano did come from you.  Anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the Nano itself.  It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.  I have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it, but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible, it works great.  It fits snugly in this case, yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all.  The belt clip is sturdy and secure.  The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The case can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. This case is as cool as the Nano itself and I would very highly recommend it. I hope Belkin makes the same case for the new IPOD	1
The price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item, but after only about 1,000 pictures, all I got was corrupted data.

"In short, why a 1 Star Rating you wonder?

Took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up I doubt will ever work for anyone.  Though it does work once finally set up.
__________________________________________________________

So I decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop, new wireless router, and a wireless print server (PS), so I can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house.

I did a lot of research and decided to get a Belkin router (F5D7231-4) and this PS from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. This is definitely not the case!

First be warned this product IS NOT WPA compatible!  Thus, even though the router is WPA able, you cannot use WPA with the PS and thus have to use WEP for the network once this product is used.  Hopefully in the future this product will support WPA, but it would only hopefully do so thru a Firmware Upgrade.  Do not think this PS is WPA compatible.

Next, be warned the box says ""3 Minute Easy Install"" - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the PS working now wirelessly.  I am not a computer techie, but I am smart, a great problem solver, and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages.  

I tried to set-up the PS on a static IP address, as recommended by my techie friends, but this just did not happen.  Thus, next time I restart the router it may assign the PS a different IP address and then I'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so I plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue.

The crux of how I got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the MAC addresses of the PS and computers in the network.  This is the golden key I searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router's and PS's web interfaces.  Only this way was I able to unhook the LANd-line from the PS to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly.

Belkin tech support had medium wait time, friendly techs (not always speaking English without thick accents though), and they were unable to solve my golden key for me.  They even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened.

So, yes, the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that I had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than I ever wanted or expected to, and I had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work."	0

"This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space. 
I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the GPS unit in my hands.  Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal.  I was convinced it was defective.  It's not.  Once I put  it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes.
This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time.  I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this GPS (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America.  
My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.  It was flawless!  It's impossible to get lost with this thing.  Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route.  The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams.  The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel.  It's kind of a ""best traffic scenario"" prediction.
This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.)
If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a GPS system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!"	1
I've been looking for this style of phone for a while, looks great, works great but it's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use.

I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home.  If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women. Also it does not have any plugs for headsets.  I am returning mine to Amazon	0

I do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon.com, but this time as I was listening to my car audio today, I was compelled to leave one for others. This product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments I bought for mp3 player/audio system. Its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality. It does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds, resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity. Mine worked ok for the first several hours I assume. I think it damaged the speaker, and it now sounds like it's going to rip apart. Someone else left review explaing this trouble, which I ignored, which was a mistake. Again, don't buy.	0
"If your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy, like me, I would highly suggest this product. Sounds are crystal clear, and fiber optics is the next step up in technology.

The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again	0

Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble.

"Great item.  Picture great, sound great, connection choices great.
One problem:  Being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio, the presence (shut off) of this TV produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio.  To eliminate this sound you must unplug this TV from the power source! Or, optionally, move it at least three feet away, which in our case is not practical.
Very curious!"	1

You will need a good antenna and I wish they provided one like Miglia.  But guess what, you can buy the Miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from Radio Shack or Target.  The Miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel.

The product shipped immediately, a new Dell AC Adapter from Cable4Less.

I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.  Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer.  Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand.  I think it is a much better design	0

"I have a 40"" Samsung LCD and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so.  This arm feels solid and does the job; the tv hasn't fallen yet.  One thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv.  My arm came with a 200 x 100, but I needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately.

"I agree with the prior review of these JBL E10s, however I'd go to the E20s for a small room main stereo set--better bass worth the slight price increase.  Bought for rear channel (RC) use, I find the E10s quite ""airy"", with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main E30s I just bought from A'.com (see my 5 Star review), giving extremely open and detailed ""surround"" RC performance.  

NOTE: The specs listed on A'.com for the E10s state ""Bi-wireable: Yes"" BUT...unless JBL has just changed the terminals to do this that's wrong--mine have just a single terminal set, and DON'T BOTHER with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories (unless you plan ceiling installs) as they come with two ""slide down"" screw slots attached to the back for wall installation.  

Surfing for the BEST PRICE, I bought mine refurbished from [...] for a LOW $53.00 bid plus $18.00 S+H directly from JBL and you may find the E30s/E20s from JBL as refurbs there as well.

As RC speakers--ESPECIALLY at the price I got them--I recommend them highly, well deserving the 5 Star rating given"	1

"Ok.... I bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain... hey 5GB for less than $100 what a deal.  Once you get the hang of loading and working with the Windows Media Player its not a big deal to load.  Unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs (which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs) you get really good at it.  Had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the HD and no longer worked at all.  I thought maybe the reason was that I had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better... right?

So I stupidly bought a brand new one.. again less than $100.  This one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and I just recently got the ""not recognizing the HD"" message.

I have an iPaq PDA and I own a TomTom GPS -- both of which work well.  This combo iPaq/TomTom is 'in the rough' and needs to undergo some re-tooling. I'm surprised that other reviewers mention what I deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star. For example, the Travel Companion stalls and needs soft-resets.  For a right handed person, the stylus is awkward.  Support is not good. Moving through programs can be painfully SLOW. The GPS tracking lags. I depend on my GPS and PDA for business travel.

"I got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my MBP (silver theme). Someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should, or in the wrong way but mine works fine.

CONS:
- light indicator shows exactly which USB ports are in use. 
- Small in size
- Has USB port on top which comes in handy.
- Enough USB power- so far I didn't have to plug in the power charger yet. 
- Comes with a USB plugged light. 
- Comes with a extended USB cable (for you to connect the hub to your computer)
- the USB plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice.


PRONS:
- it camed with some minor scratches on the hub's surface although I just took it out from its sealed package carefully. Those surface scratches aren't too noticeable. (Didn't want to return it and waste time & money). 
- as many have already mentioned, the USB cable is connected to the hub permanently. 


Other thoughts:
- The USB cable connected the the hub is pretty thin. It'd be a good feature (look less noticeable) f you treat the cable nicely, but if you are harsh on the cable, it feels like it may break. Will be GREAT if this hub has firewire ports, but I'm very happy with this item"	1

"I've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems.  I don't know anything about an upgrade but so far I haven't had any major problems with it.  When I left it in the car and then came home it wouldn't turn on.  I noticed it was very warm but as soon as I did a soft reset the device turned on.  The soft reset doesn't make you lose all your data.  I just had to reset the date.  I've had to do this a couple of times so far.  

 I did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room.  I recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because I bought mine from amazon and then I found it cheaper at best buy.

I am really happy with this product. I love the way it looks.  It's easy to figure out and I'm not really savvy with electronic gadgets.  I did sign up for hotmail so I could use the msn features.  It was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync.  The music sounds great with a great pair of headphones. I use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments.  Also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done.  Great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things. There is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words.  Really neat!

I use the recording device to record my class lecture and it's a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and I sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front.  But the important thing is that I could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it.  As a nursing student I was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great.

I just can't believe all the features that come with this pocket pc.  I have no regrets making this purchase.  I look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do.  So far it's been fun"	1

"I ordered the Cisco Aironet 1231 the other day, and after it arrived, set it up, and...couldn't get a wireless signal. I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router.

Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing"	0

I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work?

Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product"	0

"I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static.

Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.

This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.

"It's a good phone, works well. I like the Caller ID & Function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone, makes them easier to see & use. It has good sound & a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves.
The only problem I had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone & one must use the cord that the phone comes with, rather than one already in use. I purchased an adapter so that I could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack. Not a big deal in my book but one I didn't learn about until I got the phone.
Overall I am pleased with it"	1
While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still.

Mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when I jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape.  He still insisted he couldn't remember anything, but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke.  Very effective, these ""old-fashioned"" recorders. "	1

This player is junk.  It would not play music for more than two hours before going dead.  When I called Toshiba, the person that I talked to claimed he wasn't aware battery life was even a problem.

Now (after two weeks) it won't even hold a charge.  I'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone	0

"The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

"Opened the enclosure, plugged in my hard drive, connected it to my PC, and it worked. Simple as that.

I spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that I had to remove a single screw from the back panel when I really had to remove two screws, but that was the only (very minor) problem.

There is no fan in the case, which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. I am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink, but I havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself.

"We bought this to use with our WS-300M to record a class. We thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording. In the end, we set the recorder to MONO (HQ) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other! Good quality but distracting.

We wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom.  The reason I give two stars is because of Beach Camera's return policy.

"I purchased this GPS back in April of 2006 and have been very happy with it since.  It is not perfect, but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker GPS, it's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises.

In the car:  It is accurate and maps routes quickly 90% of the time.  The other 10% of the time it either looses signal, has outdated maps (my update is ordered and on it's way as I type), or just slow processing for some reason.  Of this 10% of the time I'd say only 2% of the time has this been an actual problem for me.  The rest of the time I was able to simply guess what I needed to do next or it didn't matter at all.  I have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations, but the vast majority of the time this hasn't been an issue.

On foot:  One of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof.  Both qualities needed to be used for hiking.  The only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads, otherwise you will get some really confusing directions!  Also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses, but it can be done (put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route!).

On Boat:  Haven't tested this as I don't have a boat, and haven't purchased the water based maps.

Overall I'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update.  I wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing, and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points.  It's still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate GPS systems to me"	1

I own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds. I have to say that the only way to improve upon this product, other than offering more color combinations, would be to make it bulletproof, which it damn near is already. A wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory. Although $15 might come across as steep for such a small product, the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds.

This portable TV sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design.  They don't tell you that there is NO ANTENNEA nor that the TV will not work without an antennea!  The portable DVD player is great. THE TV IS HORRIBLE.  When we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken.

"The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases.

"Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good.........

After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.

"I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts.  All in all pretty pleased with the purchase.  It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini.  There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models.  Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model.  Cons:

- Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright.  You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote.
- No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week.  For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends.
- Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle.
- Sound is great for an alarm clock.  Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.

 The first ipod clock radio I bought was an Emerson iTone that was very disappointing. After returning it, I did a bunch of research, and decided to order the i177 (white). I am very happy with the unit. The sound is great. While it is not a Bose, it sounds way better than your average alarm clock. The controls are very intuitive and simple to use. I have a 4th generation ipod, and it fit perfectly. Another great feature is the display dimmer. You can turn the backlight completely off, a feature not found in many other products. A common complaint I read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room! Not a problem with this unit. the remote control is pretty neat too. I like the fact that I can control my ipod remotely. There are 2 separate alarms, which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time. The only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations. This would be nice, but I bought this unit to wake to my ipod so I can't complain. Overall this thing is great.	1

"I got this case for my WS-320M, which I've been wearing around my neck like a MP3 player.

The material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt.  It looks good = professional looking.

I've enclosed what I hope are representative pictures of this case.  All the buttons of the recorder are accessible.  Even when the flap is closed, the microphone/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons.  If the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone, you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well.  There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the ""HOLD"" button on the side of the recorder.  Not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the ""HOLD"" button.  However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released, if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the ""HOLD"" button.

The belt loop is an adjustable velcro.  I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. Most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times.

The case is closed shut with another velcro strap,

All in all, it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport.  Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in MIC, headphone, recording/playing) is set up.  The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case.  The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder.

My bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive.  Placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such.

I think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.

On one positive note, I believe this is the first time that I was the first reviewer for anything from Amazon.  Woo Hoo"	0
"I bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk, and for that purpose it's an admirable phone.

Plus: The contrast- adjustable LCD displays current date and time without you having to set it, the buttons for call list browsing, option setting, etc. are on the back of the receiver so you don't have to take the phone off the hook to use them. The sound quality is great of course, this being a corded phone, and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand. The keypad lights up, although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark! The ring tone is nice at its medium setting.

Minus: I find the base a bit bulky, the LCD has no background light, and when the handset is set to ""hi"" volume, you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base (I keep the setting at ""lo"" though, which is plenty loud). My main gripe is that the phone doesn't have a voicemail indicator, which would be extremely sweet with my phone company (Vonage). Also, the caller id stuff works with batteries ONLY - at least, they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone.

Still, four stars because the phone does all it says it does"	1

"This monitor is an awesome buy.  I had no problems with my monitor, dead pixel-wise.

The only complaints I have to add are those that others have already voiced.  The stand does not securely fasten to the monitor, it just sort of sits there... a good push and down she may go.  The menu buttons on the right side aren't confusing to use, my other monitors have used a similar setup: Menu activates menu and also activates a menu item, up/down change values, menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit.  If I had put two of these monitors side by side, I can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue, minor but perhaps irksome.

"This printer is a piece of junk. The print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges, the mechanism is likrly to be damaged. Like other HP printers operating under XP, it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g. paper jam, paper out). Cancelling a print job results in a ""deleting document message"" which remains until printer is disconnected (you can turn it off under these circumstances) and computer is rebooted. Often XP hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering. I have long had this problem with an older HP model, but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now, but alas.... The crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge. The tricolor cartridge, costing about $18 at Wal-Mart, lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up.

"Looking at the photo of this item, I noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is NOT the screw on contraption needed for my eXplorist 400, so I was hesitant to purchase it until I did further research and found out WHY the plug is different.

You still need the USB cable that came with the eXplorist and have to bring it in the car too!

The big AC plug detaches from the USB cable, and AHA!  Now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into!   Then you screw that cable onto your GPS unit as when you charge it via AC.

In other words...  This charger does NOT plug into your GPS, it plugs into your GPS charger cable which attaches to your GPS.

But I don't want to take that cable in the car with me, because if it gets damaged or lost, then I can never charge the unit at all, not even at home with AC.    So I was forced to find and purchase another USB cable assembly seperately, to keep in the car with this car lighter charger.

Magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it.

The car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord, but what good is it?  You still have to have the long USB cable attached to it anyway!

"They don't collapse, so they aren't the most easily portable as you sure aren't putting them in your pocket.  You also aren't listening to music in bed with them, as mentioned in other reviews, the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears.

I tend to collect lower end headphones, and why not.  So, I do have a unique perspective on them (or so I say, mostly to flatter myself).

These, compared to other vertical designs, are good.  The sound is better than most.  Not quite as good as the Sony h.EAR line, but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks.  These p9's are simple, one piece, and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear.

The volume adjustment makes them nice for Tv and computer use.  Also, if you ever listen while using a splitter, make sure the other person is wearing the cans (or whatever more power consumptiony headphones) so you can cut your volume.  My wife wears cans when watching TV, so when I just MUST watch some witty Sonic commercial, I just plug myself in.

They aren't perfect.  I'd like to also try the Sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the Sony folding ones.  They did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my Rio Carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing).  

For reference, my everyday buds are Sony ED21LPs, which I highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out, and can be stored in a very small area.  Heck, I even use the stupid pouch that comes with them.

I have two home theater setups.  One is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from Polk Audio.  The other is a dedicated theater utilizing Definitive Technologies with B&K Reference 7.1 Processing.  Clearly the Bose VCS-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup.  However, I have run it with my Polk Audio's and it was workable.  The timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my Polk CSi3 but it was not awful.

My bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker.  Can you buy a better one in this price range.  I think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system.  You should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it's not just about one speaker.  If this speaker fits your space and (more importantly) matches your other speakers, then it may be the right speaker for you"	0
I purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up.  This mic was inexpensive and works fine so far.  We haven't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time	1
I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake. 	0
"These DVDs never fail...
I've tried other brands and had miserable results.
Stick with Memorex and you won't be sorry"	1
I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth	0

This was my first, and only, purchase of a Linksys product. I unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer, then hooked it up to another printer, only to have it die just out of warranty.

"In spite of some of the poor reviews for this product, it met all of my expectations 100%. Thanks to the reviews, I understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries, which was helpful to know in advance. But of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place.

I was looking for a small TV to fit in the corner of my bathroom, and this unit is perfect for that. As a bonus, I can not only watch the news while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, but I can listen to MP3 rips when I'm in the shower. I've owned the unit for several weeks now, use it every day, and have never had a problem playing any disk, either copy-protected movies or CDs. My only concern so far has been that I didn't receive a warrantee card with the unit.

I especially like the portability. It's so easy to pick up and take anywhere, such as watching a movie in bed, and even outside (if it's not too bright out) for watching sports on the patio. The speakers are adequate, considering their size, and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if I want better quality.

In summary, I have to repeat that my expectations were set before I bought the unit and I am very pleased with what I got for the price"	1
"I've had this phone for approx. 9 months now, maybe longer...and I truly don't know how I've stood using this dual phone system for so long.  However, tonight I've taken a giant step ""upward"" towards better quality and design with the Panasonic KX-TG 5432M dual system.  

This dual handset is the worst I've ever experienced in a cordless system.  From the moment I set it up, the static has been atrocious.  Step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear.  I can't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person.  Even within six feet of the base I receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting, not only to me, but to the other person on the other end...for they hear it too. I will never purchase another uniden product, if this is the non-quality of product they put out.  I had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system...and I wish I'd never gotten rid of it.

As the title says...If you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone, this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear. The melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep, but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head. Uniden should be ashamed of this product.

"We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program.

Do NOT buy this if you own the c340--it doesn't fit and Amazon shouldn't market this as if it will. It's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund.

After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake.

"Can't say enough good things about this Brother all-in-one, given its price and features.  (I paid $100 more than the new Amazon price elsewhere a week ago.)

I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same.  Super fast prints from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous HP laser.

Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy.  What I did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior HP experience.

Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and print engine.  No big deal IMHO.

Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far:  (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not.

Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others.

"Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The ""change sensitivity"" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).

I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).

"I did my research before purchasing this wireless card from Amazon to use in conjunction with my Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  According to every net review I'd read, this combination of Belkin Pre-N desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class, and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router, 'range' is what I needed above all.

After some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself, I now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not I had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.)

The odd thing about this 'Pre-N' combination from Belkin is that apparently the later Belkin N equipment is grossly inferior, and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model.  

These cards and the Pre-N router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores, so if you have to operate wireless at great distances, I doubt you'll beat these Belkin models for at least the immediate future"	1

I recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son.  The piano arrived in fine shape.  The piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly.  The sound is just like I remember a toy piano should sound.  Notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument, but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale, including sharps and flats.   Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this piano.  Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy, including the electronic toys, we have purchased for him.

These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.	0
"In my opinion, Sony's strength lies in its TVs.  This line of LCD sets are expensive, but you'll definitely get what you pay for.  The picture quality is incredible!  The beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art.  While the internal speakers are decent, I would have been just as happy not to have them.  But thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel, you don't even know the speakers are there.

Some reviewers have mentioned ""LCD clouding"", and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate Google search.  But Sony stands by its products, and if you receive a set that is not up to standards, they will rectify the situation.  Also, many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture.  It is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the TV, and what signal will give you the optimal image.  Not all HD signals are the same, and will provide you with varying degrees of quality.  Be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device.  But, I have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous Panasonic tube set.

The interchangable bezels is a nice idea, but only for those with deep(er) pockets.  The silver set alone is beautiful, and if I had only one complaint, it would be that it's harder to get matching Sony peripherals in silver than you might think.  All in all, it's the best LCD you can buy"	1
seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception.  i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal.  price-wise, it was great.  however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well.  the directions are terrible.  they are extremely difficult to follow.  i never could get it to sync with outlook.  i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work.  i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child's play in comparison.  in this case, you get what you pay for.  don't purchase this, you'll be sorry.   Take care, it's a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly, the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much.  punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum.  do you carry the manual with you.  put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language.  truly disappointed with this worthless plastic. 	0
"As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful.

Ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your PS2 to your compatible tv/receiver. These cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. Therefore, you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the PS2 offers for both audio and video. However, your sound will be uncompressed, fully digital audio. This is definitely a plus, rather than a negative. Any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input"	1

I have been happy with these phones.  I find no problem with the sound - no static at all.  The only small thing I have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little.  I do not understand the terrible reviews - this phone is very usable	1
"I have owned the DMR-ES40V for over 6 months. It is a combo DVD/VCR unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. 

The MANUAL:  It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere.

The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet). 

DVD PLAYBACK: The general playback is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my JVC progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present. 

DVD RECORDING: Recording onto a DVD-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned VCR tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home. 

THE VCR USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying.

LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty JVC unit. 
I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere."	0
I don't understand the 1 star reviews, unless there is some product variability.  Price was $60 at Target.  Talk time is OK, although the longest I have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Range is fine.  Phone works all over the house, and audio quality if fine	1
"The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny ""button within a button"" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is"	0

I watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also.

"These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.

However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else.

But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go"	1

there is no hands free speakerphone;
if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units).
There is more:
the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment;
the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it;

"Great GPS unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that. Clear easy to read display and instructions. Menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it. No downloads, activations or learning required. 

Satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast. Accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps. Even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled. 

After looking at the Garmin and Magellan units I thought this was the best unit for the price. It has the largest screen and the most features for this price range. A previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of Bluetooth capabilities to which I completely disagree. The fact the Bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive. Also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand. All manufacturers seem to sell them as options (Garmin included)."	1
"This product has the potential to be tremendous, but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched. That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience, now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches.

Also, there is a big 'rhigo-skin' logo on the front, which makes the case even that more distracting.

I'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail. 

What a letdown.

P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case, it will double the thickness of your setup"	0
This is another terrific assortment of Sharpie permanent pens, for a very good price. Try them. I'm never without Sharpies, and this deal is good	1
"This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.

However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.

Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use"	0

"I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The ""mouse"" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search"	0
This is the first DVD recorder I purchased. I used the quick set up guide and I was off to the races. The quality of my recordings are crisp and clear.

This VERY expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the Forerunner 201.  You won't need this unless you somehow lost it.  Damn, it is expensive!  This is a cable for goodness sake	0
"We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find.

Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing.

If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the Sony name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full backup using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. Backup copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes.

The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job).

Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from Sony. Also bought pack of 25 Ritek 8x DVD+RW discs from TheTechGeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of Velocity 8x DVD-R discs. So, for well under $200 and a little effort, you too can view, hear, copy and/or backup your valuable photos, videos, tunes and other data in no time"	1
"I purchased this because I have to do a lot of math online and was hoping I could use this for that purpose.  Also I was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes.  

So far, I'm not impressed.  The pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use.  It is actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you have to press VERY hard to get your entire note set to be recorded.  Talk about writer's cramp!

I'm also disappointed that you can't write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively.  My fault for not understanding the functionality better but I thought this could double as a writing tablet.  

I can't speak to the size of the paper since I haven't tried any other size.  

In general, a big disappointment and 90 dollars that I would have been better off just setting on fire!  Another item destined for Craigslist.

p.s. -- to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text.

The printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper. Quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why I bought it in the first place. I am yet to try printing photos. Because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting. It might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni	1
I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body	0
I bought this enclosure about 1 year ago.  I put a 200GB hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated iTunes library. It was a super easy setup.  Many complain in the other reviews that it's a tight fit inside, but I didn't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in.  After connecting the hard drive and closing it  up, I simply connected it via FireWire to my Mac G4 and it worked like a charm! Next month I will have it for 1 year and I would be 100% happy with it if not for one thing... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on! ARGHH!!  All of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time.  Every-so-often, the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes, but it ALWAYS returns with a vengence!  Otherwise, the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year.  I'm definitly going to get rid of it though once I find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable, but not NEARLY as noisy!!!  It's a shame actually, since I'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my Aperture library and data backup, respectively	1

I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase. Although the case is plastic (my other one was aluminum and plastic) I won't be moving mine around so that won't be an issue	1

"This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.

And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true.

I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible.

I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks.

The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do.

I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing.

One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon"	1

Ok, switching over to a wired keyboard!!  The above mess was me trying to type on the Microsoft 6000 V2 Keyboard!!  I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!!

I type for hours on end per day and have been typing ""properly"" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!)

No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it!

Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.)

I almost didn't purchase this CD player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting, but I decided to go for it! I am glad I did, I am very happy with this Sony Walkman! I use it for walking, listening to meditating CDs, audio books, everything and have not had one single problem with it. I am so glad I did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision! As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman! Those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2-3 weeks must not take care of your things. I love it, the price was great, so don't let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase!	1
"Malfunctions:
1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music.
2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward.
3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.

Design issues:
It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title).
It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it.
It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice.
The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones.

Good things:
I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it).
It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed.
The large storage capacity proved fully necessary.
You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).

My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks"	0
The product works fine. It seems kind of strange that I had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that I needed.

"After my trusty Archos player's display broke, I figured I upgrade and get me a 60GB iAudio X5. As a journalist doing interviews, I was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3. A friend of mine loves his player, so I didn't even flinch when I saw the price.

Ever since then I regret my decision.

Apparently my player has a software problem. It speeds up all my mp3 files. I tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing. That is when I was actually able to upload mp3s, because oftentimes I received error messages and the player refused to do as told.

So what then: Upgrade the firmware. Sure. If you can make it work and I couldn't. The description online is poorly written. But it's essentially like this: Start with a fully loaded battery. Unplug the A/C cabel and unpload the Firmware. Now replug the A/C cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware. Well all it does is conclude that the battery isn't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else.

I.e. I couldn't get the firmware to update and I tried for the last hour.

"I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing. 

Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one. 

All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in"	0
"Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and MP3.  Woohoo.   What a selection.

Then, we have the iAudio.  It has perhaps a half inch thickness, at most, over the iPod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an XL), though it includes so much more bang for your buck, even if some of that bang is kind of useless.  But come on; an FM radio isn't iPod standard?  Almost every other portable HD player has that by now.  

About the only thing iPod has over iAudio is movie quality, which is, admittedly, better.  But I'm fairly basic; I'm buying it for my music, not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen.  If I want to do that, I'll buy a portable DVD player. For pictures, unless they're ridiculously high quality, this suits just fine.  But it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound quality.

Which.  Is.  Marvelous.   It consistantly beats iPod, it has BBE equalizer, and it not plays MP3 and AAC, but WMA, WAV, OOC, and FLAC.   *FLAC.*   And if you download Rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own, kids), you can create themes, boost your battery life, and augment your listening pleasure even further.

The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack.   What is a subpack?   It's a fairly good idea done badly.  It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player.  In it are the power jack, line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem, unfortunately) and line-in jack, and USB port.   The general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else, but it wasn't executed too well.  Buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and USB port problems nicely, and is recommended most highly.

"My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it.

I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure.

Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.

"The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though:
- The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa.
- The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none. 
- The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions.
- The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models.
- The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.

"I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to ""keep shopping.""  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought ""how bad can it be?""  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.  

First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with ""Other"" GPS units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it?  Or they haven't had experience with GPS in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing? 

For positive reviewers, if this is their first ""newer"" GPS and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational GPS Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the ViaMichelin has a ""horrible"" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the ViaMichelin is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly.  Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system.  So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it.  But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it ""loses"" it and you have to program the history all over.  You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how ""lost"" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros:

Pros:  Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life.  Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit.

Cons:  Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry.  Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible.  I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it.  Third, unlike ANY GPS I've had, this one literally tells you to ""start driving"" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc.  Think about that!  It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way!  Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say ""NO"" as most GPS will at least tell you to ""turn right"" from where you are parked or ""turn left"" but this one will say ""start driving"" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road.  It can't do it from a parking lot!  It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming.  It makes you ""start driving"" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling.  Bad software design for sure.  When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border.  Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist.  I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my  Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits.  Want to find POI's on the run?  Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years.  I'm serious.  I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts.  To be sure, Garmin, TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town.  Not so Via.  In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years.  Punch in  local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them.  Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location.  But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing.  So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store.  Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is.  It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the Garmin or TomToms.  This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's.  No GPS finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course.  But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a GPS themselves before.

I can't say enough about how ""difficult"" the interface is....and when you go ""back"" or ""forward"" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps.  When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be?  I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason.  WRONG!  The experienced GPS users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek Garmin or Tom Tom interfaces.  Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital.  This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital.  Which is horrible.  I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital.  

Truly, I am sad to not recommend the ViaMichelin.  I really recommend you ""pass"" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker.  If you are tech challenged, buy the Garmin or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface.  

But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit.  On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use.  

Finally, there is the ""fun"" factor.  The TomTom One is fun.  The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use!  Even the newer Garmin's are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old Garmins.)  But the ViaMichelin X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country.  Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where Garmin and TomTom shine.  The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older Garmin's use an older satellite GPS chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same GPS satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips.  But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via Michelin, cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio.  The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals.  But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use GPS in my opinion.  If you are looking for software ease, go Garmin first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last.  If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable.  But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with Garmin first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. ViaMichelin, but you need to go to ""finishing school"" like the other GPS students.  You are just too unfinished and rough"	0

"Bought these to use while doing my daily walks & mowing.  They work 100% better than the little ""lipstick"" antenna you get with the MyFi plus you don't have to use the earphones.  The only time I lose signal is if I'm really boxed in an area that doesn't face south.  It actually works in some areas inside my house.  The sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me.  Besides, there ain't much in the way of other options.

"The PCI bus does not have the bandwidth to get you Gigabit speed.  You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a PCI gigabit card, even with jumbo frames.

Your motherboard has two PCI busses, and sometimes has three.  Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses.  You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the PCI bandwidth it can get, but that will not be close to gigabit speed, either.  Best case on 33 MHz PCI is 300 megabit.

Even if you can find which PCI bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz PCI busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card, anyway.  If you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 MHz PCI, PCI-X (not PCI Express), 64-bit PCI, or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that.

Worse yet that built-in Gigabit interface might still be on a 33 MHz PCI bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed.  It probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework"	0
"Things that I like: 
(1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.  
(2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.  
(3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.  
(4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.  
(5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.  
(6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.  
(7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being ""out of range.""  
(8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort.

What I don't like:
(1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far.
(2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width.

This product costs too much for being such poor quality, I can literally just pull the cord apart bare-handed without using barely any force at all. And after it's torn apart there is no hope of repairing it, no matter how much time, effort, and thought you put into it, it's impossible. I'm pretty sure that it's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another. The only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality, and their comfort. The sound quality sounds a little better than the normal iPOD earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore. But if you plan on using these while you're leading a busy, active life, I GUARANTEE that they wont last a week. I heard that these earphones are the best...I found out that they are indeed some of the worst...and sadly I found that out the hard way..	0
I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required	1
I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge.

"I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality.

"I've held off reviewing this item until I actually got some alerts - and I got plenty of them over the weekend, so here it is....

There seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set-up - so many, that after having no problems setting it up myself, I'd worried I'd done something wrong.  Over the weekend, a number of thunderstorms & tornados rolled thorough my area - using the S.A.M.E alert system for my county - I received a notification for each warning.  

I purchased this radio specifically for the S.A.M.E alert system, living in central Mississippi, we get tornado warnings all spring - I didn't want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me.  

My one beef with the unit is the radio reception - even the included external antenna, it's spotty - ESPECIALLY the weather radio reception.  I'm not sure how far I am from the nearest weather radio transmitter, but living in the suburbs of Madison, I can't be too far.

"I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net.

I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.  This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time"	0

"I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!

Yes, the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick, but I've had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems with it.  Also, I rarely need to reconfigure it, so there's not an issue of ""wandering"" from the centre point.

They evidently didn't hire the ""good"" designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults.

#1: The shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in ""the right position"".

#2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). On this ""gaming"" mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade.

The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning.

I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street.

I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing. Calling this a ""gaming"" mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of.

This univeral DVD player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek.  The finish of the DVD player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department.  This player can play PAL DVDs, it upconverts it to NTSC & 1080i.  It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most DVD players out there.  The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best.  The audio controls in the setup are awesome.  People have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine.  It's very quick to load and play.  You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features.  The HDMI cable that is included with the player is of good quality.  Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market.  Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal DVD player.  Buy one and you'll know	1
I purchased this printer for it's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum, but it's really been a let down. The printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out. So  now I have to send 3 copies of everything I want to the printer, wasting paper and ink. I've tried different kinds of paper, and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at Brother, but it continues to do this. I've looked around the Internet, and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models. It's really an inconvenience, and now I have to purchase a new printer because it's such a pain. If you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use, this is the printer for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs	0

"Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.  

You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.

While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to ""turn it off"", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!

I have a 42"" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26"" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!  

I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP"	0
"This is a direct comparision between the Linksys WUSBF54G and TrendNet 509UB.

Both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector.

Both perform as expected on Windows XP. Installation was quirky for both. After driver installation, inserting into USB slot it wasn't recognized at all. Fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before XP recognized the device.

Client software does not detect a device under Windows Vista Ultimate RC2. I assume this will be true for Windows Vista RTM too. Inserting the device into a Windows Vista RC2 system often completely froze Windows Vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before Vista recognized the device.

Appears that the TrendNet and Linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same OEM or reference design. As expected, evaluation results are similar.

1. Both devices seem to have same sensitivity, similar to notebook's internal wireless card.
2. TrendNet device doesn't have Windows XP signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. Also installing on new USB ports requires extra clicks.
3. TrendNet device supports 801.11a whereas Linksys does not.
4. TrendNet device sometimes crashes Vista Ultimate RC2.
5. Neither device's software client works under Vista Ultimate RC2. This isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under Vista Ultimate RC2 networking as a USB wireless key. You just lose the client software feature.
6. The Linksys has a somewhat useful backlit LCD, TrendNet does not.
7. Both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well.
8. In hotspot mode, both devices show SSID, channel number, encryption mode, etc.

Conclusion: For XP, I recommend the TrendNet so save the extra dollars. For Vista, I recommend the Linksys device as it never crashed Vista Ultimate RC2 whereas TrendNet device was gave occasional freezes"	1
"I would never buy this TV again or a Samsung product for that matter. I obviously purchased a lemon, have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck. Samsung initially told me I would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when I called back I was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period. How's that for sound logic.

I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms	1
"Specs look good. HDMI 1.3a, 1080p, firmware upgrade over Ethernet, etc. The unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built.

However, Toshiba chose to ship this HD-DVD player with only a composite A/V cable (yellow, red, white RCA jacks) in the box. The best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i, and not even as good as an S-Video connection for that!

It is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and HDMI 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or HDMI) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an HDTV. I don't know how much cost savings Toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5.

Now let's get to the real review:

Pros:
- One of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular DVDs to 1080p. The upscaling is very high quality. The unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered DVDs.
- If the weight of the unit is any indication, build quality is high.
- It has an Ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality)

Cons:
- Very slow boot time. Takes longer to boot than my Windows XP PC.
- Especially durimg 1080P HD-DVD playback, the unit gets very hot. Make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. There is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player.
- This player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic DVDs, so you have to use your TVs scaling function. Kind of  a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers"	0

"This is a great TV.  Bought after looking around for months.  Receive HDTV signals, about a dozen without cable box.  The number will continue to rise, but all of the main shows and programs are in HD.  Especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in HD.  True you will only get about 720P resolution from the broadcast over the air currently, but when the Blue-ray HD movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price, this will become the standard.  And this TV has 2 HDMI ports so you are ready to go.  I have had another CRT sharp which I have liked, and this product is no different.  Picture is amazing.  Some analog channels dont look that great, but I am at the point where where I would rather watch whatever is on an HD channel.  
Note:  I am in what is considered an upgraded cable section.  The TV has the tuner to receive HD without the box as I have said, but I can't speak to sections that are not ""upgraded"", so you may want to look into that.  Nice to receive without paying for extra equipment. "	1

"If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.

My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good GPS and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine.

Background: my GPS experience is limited to a 7-year old Garmin III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the waypoints and routes to the GPS. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it.

Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination.

Now for the rundown.

First - what it doesn't do well.
a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed.  It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route.  Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old ""logging"" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later.
b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove ""my way."") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route.  Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn.

Now, what it does well:
a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at.
b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC.  Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants?  I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map.  And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer GPS. It passed this with flying colors.
c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon.
d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great.

I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual.  From the navigation map, if you touch the screen, it has a ""bypass route"" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on.  Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer.  The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out.

In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) GPS. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review.

Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me"	1
Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again.

"One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.

As an aside I love Amazon and NewEgg. Great retailers both of them"	1
"Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an ""isupercharger"" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along."	0
"Had mine for over half a year now, and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day I bought it.  I fill it and empty it every month, rarely ever defragging it, back up my PC files and play movies right off it on my laptop.  Throw it in my backpack, plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping), still with rarely a sign of slowdown, and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack).

For some reason requires two usb ports on my new PC (high speed USB2.0 ports) when it shouldn't.  It runs on one port at school just fine and I have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50% success.

I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I ever thought the one I have would run itself out.  The fact that it doesn't need an external AC adapter to run on my USB1.1 laptop ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included AC adapter)is a blessing.  I've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom AC doesnt work on both sadly).  Might be luck of the draw, HD related items seem to be sometimes, and I've yet to have to try out their customer service.  But overall worth every cent spent(especially since I was looking at a 4GB external for $40 before I saw this). Nearly $1 a gig is a great deal."	1

The product was shipped to me in Moscow. After the first charge, I took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours. Upon returning home and recharging the device, I discover that it will not turn on anymore. I suspect the battery is charging as the LED indicates this as it is connected to AC power. However, disconnecting it from any power source, it appears that the AC outlet and USB ports no longer function. The device gives no auditory signal or LED message, so I don't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it. Either way, I'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 Watt solar panel anyway. I strongly suggest getting the battery from Tekkeon. Sorry about the bad review, but I had my hopes for this device as well.	0

"I LOVED this printer!!  The print quality is truly phenomenal!  I had a few issues with paper sizes, too many pieces being fed through, the rear feed slot, same as other reviewers, but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful.  And yes, I am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer, because it is DEAD at the ripe old age of 13 months!  Exactly ONE MONTH after the 1-yr warranty, my printer is ""unfixable"".  And HP won't do anything for me... after speaking to 8 people on the phone (only one of which I understood fully) and 3 supervisors, they just said that I'm SOL... So, yes, very nice printer, if it lasts"	0
"Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far).

It is definitely not worth it for something I get for $8 extra a month attached to my cable service.  Yes... i do love the Tivo interface and searching, but I will not pay that much for it.  It feels like business suicide for Tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price.  Knock $700 dollars off that retail price and I might change my mind	0
After all the hype on-line about the T-amp, I had to check it out for myself.  All the reports are true!  This is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price.  If you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  I recommend purchasing the AC power supply as well.  You can find others cheaper, but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the T-amp remains valid	1
"A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.

It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.

Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes"	0

"After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32"" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.

One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your PS2 with these cables or it may not work.  My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my PS2"	1
"Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary??????? 
Secondly my receiver is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, surround left is silent as it should be.  Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be.  Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. If I select the different output options, basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing. 
I am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as I do think the receiver is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well.
I major concern is something is wrong with there HDMI circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. I will update when I get the replacement installed."	0

"I bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system.  I based my decision on information as stated on the Pioneer web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered.

This receiver does have a number of good features, but has one serious flaw.  It will not display on screen status messages for daily operations, like volume and sound mode, unless you have a Pioneer display, and run another special cable from the receiver to the TV (As a side note, Pioneer needs to understand we want to run LESS cables to our display).  That means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-Pioneer TV, which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver, and very infrequently after that.  (The set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs, and audio calibtraion.)

Sounds like a small deal, but in many home theaters, including mine, the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.)  This not uncommon, many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors, and it means I have no idea what the volume is, what sound mode I am using, or anything beyond the set-up menu unless I go into the closet. BAD, BAD, BAD!  This seems to be a marketing ploy by Pioneer to get you to buy Pioneer TV's and projectors, and it is beyond stupid.  If this was not the case I would rate this receiver much higher, but it is a SERIOUS flaw.  It makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult.

This limitation also means, if you have mulitple displays, I have a plasma TV and projector in my theater, you need to run thier special cable to both displays, and both have to be Pioneer.  Again, I have to say BAD, BAD, BAD!

The other features are as stated on the Pioneer website, but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display, and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems, unless they have a Pioneer display with SR+.  (Oh yeah, your Pioneer display has to be also be equipped with SR+, thier way of linking the two units.  If your Pioneer display is not equipped with SR+, you are again out of luck.  Did I mention this is BAD?!)

25 Feb 2007 - addition to reveiw:

I called Onecall and they will take unit back, but at 15% restocking fee, plus paying for shipping both ways.  While Onecall really did nothing wrong (Pioneer is lying about the OSD!), it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud.  Buyer beware from Onecall, thier customer service on this one was not good"	0

"Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going.

Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution"	0
Recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one.  There isn't really anything special about this receiver, but it a solid one.  The two year warranty tells me they stand by their product, in case of a problem (hopefully I won't need to use the warranty).  It gives good, clean power and sound.  Don't let the 75W/channel fool you.  This is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power.  Time will tell, however, how well this receiver performs.

They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description.

I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista.  As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me.  The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling.

"This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit. 

One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics. 

Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer."	1

At some point, the TV suddenly stopped turning on.  2-3 hours on that issue and it's still not right.  TV does not go on until I hit the ""Help"" button on the remote.

To add insult to injury, I can't access the website.  Enter my email as an ID and am told it's already in the database.  I ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized.

"I've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming PC and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool.  I had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until I bought this.  After shuffling my PCI cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 Ultra I fired the machine up (and closed the case! ;-) and did some gaming, all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card.  This fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside, the cooling is even better.  As an added bonus, this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game.  

I thought for sure that I would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and I was surprised to find that I had to listen for it in order to hear it.  About the only complaint I have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back (which I knew when I bought it) so it is not temperature sensitive.  Still deserves 5 stars though"	1

This Bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my Apple notebook.  Be sure to insert the Bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin.  I thought mine was in far enough at first, but it really wasn't.  One caveat:  I was hoping that the Bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room, but it's not.

The Sennheiser PMX70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others I'd used recently. I had high hopes on first listen. However, these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes. I later took them on a 40 minute run. The design is such that in any position I adjusted them, the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear. Once I started perspiring, my sweat poured right into the little speakers. I had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces. The right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run. Who designed these? Consider these headphones only if you 1) never plan to exercise while using them and 2) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less	0

Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.  A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!)  Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box.  Don't buy this product!  If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there	0
"Length of ownership: 8 weeks

This puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device.

Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones.

Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception"	1
"I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.  

I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.  

This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless"	0
"I purchased the Hawking HWU8DD on the recommendation of several other RVers. WiFi signals at RV parks tend to be unreliable. Until now, the built-in antenna on my laptop could ""see"" the signal at my park but could not access it.

Everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it doesn't come with the USB cord to hook the printer to the computer, and that IS a LITTLE important.

"This unit satisfies in its GPS functionality, but is problematic elsewhere.  When I decided to purchase a GPS, I decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone (Motorola RAZR V3).  The bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes, even though the 6000T would still show the unit and phone as connected.  Customer service was no help.... it seems their script only includes the instructions ""download the latest software"" (I already had) and ""reset the unit"" (didn't help).  

Second problem:  the unit started turning itself off randomly (actually, it went into ""Sleep Mode"") while driving down the road.  The customer service response?  You are correct.... ""download the latest software"" (I already had) and ""reset the unit"" (didn't help).  

I finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair (at my expense, of course).  I received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired.  Their solution for the unit randomly going into Sleep Mode?  They turned off the power management so the unit would not go into Sleep Mode under any circumstance.  Well, I suppose that IS a solution, but a pretty crappy one since, if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle, the GPS battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car.

This product with the assoicated software (included) is everything you hope it is but really don't believe it will be.

"I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.  

My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.   

Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.

Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.  

So in summary the current Lexar encryption software:
- Can't be used on a Windows domain machine
- Can't be used on an Intel Mac
- Breaks the DVD on a PPC Mac

It's not for me!

However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay."	0

"I gave my mother-in-law my old Color SporTrack so she could start Geocaching.  I was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen.  This unit is it. 

Although it is large, it has features I like: AA batteries (19 hours?, we'll see), easy menu navigation, USB connection to a PC and a rugged case.

I am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces, etc.  I have sent in a list of problems I have found with the menu navigation. All of them can be worked around, but it doesn't work the way I think they intended.  It will be interesting to see if Magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of FW (I am using 1.05).

After doing a lot of research about Megllan SW (mostly negative), I decided to go ahead and purchase the Mapsend DirectRoute v.3 DVD. I found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it. One nit, the files it creates are very small.  You need to edit a text file in the Magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files. But once you get the maps downloaded to your unit (very straight forward), the menus change to indicate turning direction.  Thus, it is getting closer to a crossover unit.  Interestingly, Magellan will offer a new unit called the ""Crossover"" (available January 2007). The specs are pretty sparse on the Magellan web page"	1
"In my opinion: 
I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better. 

In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06. 

I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either. 

I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer. 

I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report. 

It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need! 

You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were.

"I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.

PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important. 

CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software."	0

My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing.

"The Lexar JumpDrive Lightning 2GB flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160X (24MB/sec) sustained Read and 120X (18MB/sec) sustained Write speed capability.  This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write speed capabilities.

The ""reality"" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be.

I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes:
* 433MB	 784 medium files, avg. 550KB	12X	4 min. 3 sec. 
* 483MB   81 large files, avg. 6MB      54X	59 seconds 
* 1GB	   1 very large file           115X	58 seconds

So, even though the Write speed capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly ""real-world"" usage.  

But, don't let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning:  The higher the ""speed capability"" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. 

To prove this point, I took one of my ""great deal"" CF cards (that had no speed ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: 
* 433MB	784 medium files   3X	15 min. 10 sec. 
* 483MB	 81 large files    7X	 7 min. 48 sec.

So, compared to the Lightning, the ""great deal!"" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files.  So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over...

Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE!  What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing.  I know, I have several in my drawer.

So, my bottom-line advice is:  Look for the highest-rated device you can find.  Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow!  So ""future-proof"" your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future.

"I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest ""advantage"" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).

I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.

"My wife and I have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via WiFi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP (VOIP) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of VOIP calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug network, using the electrical wiring as another Ethernet. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi router/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an Ethernet cable from the Netgear box to the router, and moving the Ethernet cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes. It was that simple.

When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number.

"I have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others, so I can say:  Just get yourself a better wireless router.

Based on the reviews here, several online fora, and my own personal experience, I can confirm to you that you have about a 30% chance of actually getting this to work, and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another.  But why bother?

At this point, there are higher-power routers, high-gain directional antennae, and there are even products sporting 802.11n, which inherently has a better range that -a, -b, or -g.

If you've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs, research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power--I would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network.

I understand that my suggestion may be more expensive, but I am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth.

This device is much bulkier than it needs to be. But an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod. The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod. It is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	0
I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further	1
"Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.

If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one."	0
Good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device.  My major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and I would not use it.  It is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way I replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen.

"I bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn't be happier.  The phones have the clarity of a corded phone.  The built in intercom system is perfect.  The phones allow you to ""name"" the handsets as we did (Kitchen, Basement, Bedroom, etc) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers.  They have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in, as well as jacks for headset (though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary.

One problem with these phones is the batteries.  In the year that we have had them, the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely.  Often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours, and we would go through all four phones.  Leave a phone off the charger and in a day it's useless.  The only solution was to replace the batteries (which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers).  I recommend the Energizer ER-P240, which is a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery and won't develop the Ni-Cad memory effect.

I love that the base station has a place for 4 AAA batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage"	1

"The ""LP-to-Digital Recording system"" is nothing more than a record player. Just a vanilla, run-of-the-mill record player. You still need a sound card in order to record your LPs. Most builtin (on the motherboard) sound cards have very poor audio input, so this product is not suited to its advertized function.

I am reminded of the ""solar clothes dryer"" product of a couple of years back - the box contained a rope and some clothespins.

The software is awkward and hard to use, not at all intuitive. It also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy. Any buyer would be better off getting Audacity (freely available on the net), which is easy to use and has the same features.

"I have had this item for about 6 weeks.  Haven't used to a lot, but so far I like it.  This power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one, which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things.

It has one electrical outlet, and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet, so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in.  

The plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet, but I don't know if that's the plug or the outlet on my car.  

The only thing I don't like about this item is the ""no tangle"" cord.  Its one of those coiled up cords, like a telephone cord (look at the picture of the item).  The cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat, but if I were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet.  Its coiled so tight that I couldn't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched.  It just annoys me that they call it a 36"" cord.  For practical use not more than probably 18"", but I don't have the item right in front of me to measure it.

How often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century. Nobody is moving and you can tell it's going to be a while. It would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you're stuck, but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation?

"Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund.

I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. 

The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. 

I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. 

I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards)."	0

"This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in ""cross-decking"" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience.

This one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on, that turns out to make life so much easier.  It has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work, and go through security to get into work, all without having to open my bag.  The remote has a velcro strap that I use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack.  I am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out.  My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.  As the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected, because when things do come undone, you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click.	1
I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.

"I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.

My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052.

I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly.

While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer.

All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.

[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better. 	0
This unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery, however, replacing that was quick and easy although irritating. After installation and use for a while, I noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls.

"I've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light. So I was happy to find this one. However, with my first ""Eagle"" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough."	0

Works as it should. It's enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well. Not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say, transferring huge files to an external hard drive, while burning a DVD, and fiddling with the iPod.

It's great for watching tv, but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in ""standby"" mode until it's time to record, you may be disappointed.

When coming out of standby, sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not. When it's not recognized, I have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized.

Because of this, I have missed several recordings.

Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B&H Photo and Video.

Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website  it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- .	0

I received this product from an Amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what Best Buy was selling it for. It was new and in an unopened box. Upon opening the box I was able to tell right away that it was built very good.  The hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere.  I had spent over $300 for a Runco antenna for my Runco projector for local HD (DirecTV does not have local HD in my area) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80% reception with it.  This antenna with a similar design the the Runco model is built better and I get between 94-98% reception depending on the channel (directional antenna so reception varies slightly).  I was also amazed with the fact that I not only get local channels for Youngstown Ohio, but I also get locals with over 60% reception from Cleveland (direction antenna is facing) but also Pittsburgh (which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing).  Great product and no issues with it so far.  The included booster works better than the one built into my DirecTV receiver, so I advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector (if it has a built in HD tuner) or TV for best results	1
I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included.  However when it arrived, there was no battery.  Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries.  I asked how the battery could only be worth $5.  He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	0
"I've had mine for 10 months now and it's been very reliable; not one problem with it. It's quick to print out the first page, the display is a monochrome LCD with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces (say, if you keep it under a counter), no paper jams, no nonsense. 

Also, if you're an Apple owner the drivers are already included with OS X; truly plug n print. What's a real treat is to combine it with an Apple Airport Express and use Apple's Bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer. Bonjour is available for both OS X and Windows computers, and is a breeze to install.

"I love the idea of this product, and I loved working with it. I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen.  But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy.  My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems.  More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.

Functionally, the iFM is great. I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV's. However, the construction is extremely cheap. I bought two of them and both fell apart.

"After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that.
As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by.
As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums.
As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue.
When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time. "	1

When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth	0

"I'm not a system analyst, so I need really clear instructions for any new device. I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office. 
Troubles I encountered: 
1.) Set up was impossible. I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection. I wasn't willing to do this. 
2.) I could view from the Internet within my home network, but not from my office. 
3.) Had to convince one of my company's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera's system. Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure-- which worked until I had to reset my router. 2 weeks of use in one year.
4.) I have never been able to have the camera send ""snap shots"" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program. No can do.
5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked!
6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid &lt; $80 for an indoor camera.  

Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work. For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home, but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation.  "	0

There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.

"This is an AWESOME little device. 

Let me start with the pros: 

1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button & voila.) 

2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 

3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have. 

4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse & Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly. 

5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that. 

Cons: 

1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls. 

2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers. 

3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers. 

4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more. 

For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing. 

If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great. 

Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up!

"I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets.

"The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself	0
"This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector). 

It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband. 

I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly. 

All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value."	1

"I bought these for my Zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact headphone for work and working out at the gym.

If you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium Zune buds at 40 bucks, and the Bose Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. 

I read countless reviews of this headphone and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the Bose earbuds!)
If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the Bose Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design!

The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems.

Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place.

I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading.  The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an ""over the head"" design. At $40, I can afford to get both"	1

"When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. 

Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. 

The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go. 

This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often. 

Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces.

"do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.  

I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the ""acoustimass"" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very ""tinny"" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.  

In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine"	0

"I purchased this USB light/fan combo mainly for the fan.  I'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else.  I use this fan when I'm studying in the library, on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk.  It provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over.  I can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running, of course, you can see right through the blades.  The fan runs quietly too.  I've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn't running a quickly as normal.  I just pop off the rotor head, adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and I give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case), pop the rotor head back on and it's good as new again.  

While I like this product a lot, I doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but I still think it's well worth it.  My only regret is that I didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed.  

The light works well too.  It does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but I think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document."	1

I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.

Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value!

Let me start off by saying like some others out there, Theses seemed like a dream come true.  Got my First PAIR( yes i said first) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard.  They sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected.  I was saving in the meantime for the AC-1 soundcard that goes w/ the head phones.  One day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead.  DOuble check with oter PC's and verify bad headset. OK no problem amazon was great with the exchange. got my 2nd pair in a week. I decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up.  got the card for my B-day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound. Plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a IRQ conflict i believe. O' Well just bad luck i guess.  Sent it back, again amazon very good about it.  Soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have EAX or X-fi which alot of games use.  Today i got an email saying that Amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well. so there you have it. Razer seems to have issues with it's production, thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing. Amazon was great and I'm Happy they didn't just ship me another POS	0

"So, I bought this a couple months ago.  At first, I was in love.  Great sound quality, and the surround sound aspect works well in FPS games.  Also VERY comfortable, much more so than any other 5.1 headphones I have owned.  The initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly, though.  

First of all, the microphone *sucks*.  I've seen better microphones on 20$ radio shack headphones.  These are GAMING headphones, and expensive ones at that.  You would think the microphone would be at least passable.  It isn't.  

Secondly, the build quality is pretty bad.  Within a few weeks, the control brick started giving me problems.  The sound would go off on one side or the other.  A bit annoying.  This only happens sporadically, and can be ""fixed"" by squeezing the sound controller.  Not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement, but annoying nonetheless.  

I've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws -  screws that aren't properly inserted, and they have a tendency that fall out. Now I have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone, and I can't find the tiny screw.  So I'll have to either try and repair it myself, which means trying to find somewhere I can buy tiny rare screws, or have to send it in for repair.  I might as well send it in for repair, because maybe they could also fix the volume controller...

Really kind of disappointing for supposedly ""premium"" gaming headphones.  The microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or TS.  And the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price.  I bought some 5.1 headphones for 40$ a few years back...  they only lasted a year, but they had none of the issues that the Razer has.  Kind of sad that a cheap Chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap. "	0
"After reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my IPOD. I had read a lot about how it interefered with the USB cable or the hold switch.  But I couldn't argue with the price.

I must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket IPOD products I have puchased.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, Protect My Ipod. I have no trouble opperating any of the IPOD's  buttons and I simply remove the case when I charge the unit.  I have not found that it impairs the functionality of the IPOD at all while keeping it securely around my neck.  It is perfect for Jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites.  I find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion.

Ultimately it perfectly protects my IPOD when I am out and about which is what it was designed to do.

The reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and I whished they had mounted the IPOD right side up like they did on the nano model.

Over all I am well please"	1
"Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card. 
Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.  
If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800 & 1900 series cards."	0
"For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say ""Creative"" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)"	1
This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating	0
The six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product.  I purchased this to use as an interface between a CD Walkman player and the AC power cord.  The heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly.  However, if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated, it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time.  I found the product to work effectively.  The only negative I can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting, the AH3WH can be a bit of a plug hog.  However, other than that limitation, the product was reliable.  Recommended to save on those batteries which do add up	1
Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles.  If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you.  The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard.  So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back.  My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	0
"I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat.  The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal.  I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good.

It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse.  However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have.

Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black.  However, this is again tunable.

The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up.  It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous ""next-generation"" video looks downright primitive by today's standards.

The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide.  My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal.  You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could.

This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal.  My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station.

Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming).  Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material).

As a PC monitor this is also quite nice.  I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via HDMI (with a DVI to HDMI adaptor) as well.  The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle.  However, on HDMI it should support all the standard HD resolutions.

This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio.  If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one"	1
I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle.  They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music.  That didn't last long.

I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less	0

When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.  This DVD Recorder failed miserably.  No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug).  Nice editing features if you have the time.  Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back).  I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it	0

"I bought this DVD recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format.  Plus, it's a Sony, and I've never had any problems with Sony before.  The recorder works intermittently.  It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time).  I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and ""they could not duplicate the issue"" so they sent it back.  The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows.  I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!!  Now the door is jammed and I can't take the DVD out.  Don't buy this product.  I'm buying Samsung from now on"	0
"I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10"" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10"" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.

I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. Paired with my 57"" Sony HDTV, trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. Now is a great time to pick up one of these, since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web.

Unbeatable sub for the money!"	1
Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.

The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers	1

"Claiming that this fan's ""3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling"", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air.

"I'm a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds.  The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best.  

This particular machine has wireless G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without wireless, and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, wireless is inappropriate.  (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the wireless combo IS cost-effective.  Brother essentially competes here only with itself.)  

That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router.  There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you.  It's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all.  I'm a long-time Brother customer, and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone.  There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I've owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out.  This machine is clearly out of beta.  

Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well.  You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting.  This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page.  

Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the ""ink"" aspect.  Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren't particularly low.  The non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners.  I don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a ""gas tank"" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer.   The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it.  This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here"	1
"This stuff is great.  My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains.  It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time.  The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off.  The printing will ""wear off"" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack.  However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary.

BTW, if I did not have fingernails, I could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip.  There ought to be suggestions from Brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label"	0

"I would encourage ANYONE in the market for a shredder to first identify WHERE the machine is to be placed! If you want something ""cute"" and compact, then, keep looking. This SB-97Cs is a work horse, in every sense of the word. Consequently, it may not appeal to one's feminine traits. Although the size can be a bit formidable for home use, it's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others. I was surprised at just how quiet it was! The controls are easy to master, and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child. Having had a lessor (un-named) shredder, I knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money. Being one who regularly shreds credit card ""bait"" checks, and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years, this SB-97Cs shredder was a must have. I doubt that I'll outgrow this machine. I've had this shredder for only a couple of months now, and I expect to have it for many years to come. It IS NECESSARY to oil the cutters after each full basket, though.

My intention was to share my DVI monitor with my USB keyboard and mouse between my PC and Mac.  Simple enough, this unit fit the bill according to the specs.

I had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about.  Alright, 20-minutes Googling for support lead me to the conclusion that I needed to perform firmware upgrade.  WARNING: DON'T DO IT!

"I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are:
- Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them.
- Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture.
- Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out.
- Software is a pain to use.
- Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.

That being said, I still use it. There are some good features:
- Long battery life, recharges super quick
- Very cool-looking player

"Purchased this TV December 10 after much research. Unfortunately for me the TV was defective on arrival!
When it is working it is a very nice TV, but the customer support from both Olevia and Target leave a lot to be desired.
Target will not replace the item... the corporate policy I am told is the item must be returned via shipping... you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up... and once target receives the TV back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued... they say within 30 days... my credit card company AE says it will take 6 - 12 weeks... All this time with no TV, paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears... I don't know about you but that is pretty steep!
Now Olevia... though it is under warranty I again must pack up the TV in the original box, ship it back to Olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me... the TV weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again I am without TV for a month or more while the transaction takes place. If I want a TV at the time the defective one is shipped I must give Olevia a $1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction. 
EITHER WAY THE CONSUMER GETS SCREWED!!

A lot of TV for little money.  Great picture, and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end LCD's.  Initial setup can be tricky because Olevia chose to include a CD version of the operators manual, though you can print a paper version from the CD or Olevia website.  Better than average sound, but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width.  After tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many LCD's.  If you're using it in a bedroom you'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel.  Rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible, and wall-hanging was a breeze.  Looked at many LCD televisions and there are better choices for sure, but it's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price. Highly satisfied! 	1
"SONY advertised this as a 18x burner for DVD+R media. I used the recommended brand (Verbatim) and Taiko-Yuden which are very high end media. I was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder. The movies are in .mpeg format, I was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter.  Unfortunately, I got only 12x write speed with the provided software, in a mac as well as in a PC. (Just slower than advertised, no clusters).
It is a noisy drive too.
I spoke with SONY costumer service and I could not get any satisfactory  answers. I had to wait a long time to be helped. They said that the drive was probably damaged. I returned it and I do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive."	0
"I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...

I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to ""cheat"" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the ""Artist"" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability.

So now, I can select ""artist"" ""Dinner Music"" and then ""All Discs"" and ""Shuffle"", and the unit will play a track from one ""Dinner Music"" CD then shuffle to another track on another ""Dinner Music"" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way.

I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen.

The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck!"	1
"I bought this to work with my eMac/700.  It met all of the system requirements given.  What wasn't said was that it wasn't supported by the Mac's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the Toast 6 lite.  In other words I couldn't read or write disks from any other application on the Mac.  In fact it would immediately eject the disk when I quit Toast.

Luckily, Amazon took it back.  They even paid the postage.  Unfortunately I'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office.  Additionally,  having found a new ""hi tech"" way to fib,  I'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from Amazon.  I blame Sony for this.  I know Amazon can't check out every manufacturer's claims"	0

"Usually I discount negative reviews.  I think people may have sour grapes against a company, or not understand how to install or work something.  I somewhat tech savvy - I installed our wireless network that took a little doing.  I work as a technical recruiter, so technology doesn't intimidate me.  I like technology.  

So I had been nudging my husband for a print server so that I could print without going to the printer and plugging in.  He came home with this Belkin product and went about installing it.  Usually I like to research before I purchase a product, but he wanted to handle this.  

So, he installed it, and I went back and checked his work, and he had followed the instructions exactly.  I know he had some trouble, and had called tech support at my suggestion - I would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support.  The only problem is, that the printserver doesn't work.  

So, I tried installing the software on my pc, and trying to problem solve from there.  I called the tech support hotline back, and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time.  I waited for 2 hours, then went out to run some errands.  There was still no message from a technician when I returned.

This morning my husband needed to get some work done from home.  He created a document, and knowing that the print server did not work, he wired up to the printer to print that way.  But now, the printer won't respond to the signal, so he can't print that way either.  So we deleted the Belkin software and rebooted the computer.  He still can't print.  

So, I went back to my PC, and tried to delete the software through the control panel.  It won't delete.  I am getting an error message.  I can't print either.

So now I am on hold with Belkin customer assistance.  Maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is, I swear I hear a little Indian accent.  That doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to India, and even if it is, that doesn't mean customer support is bad.  But my experience with this is that while I can get a real live person on the phone, he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back.  When I tried to get my problem escalated, I overwhelmed him and he put me on hold.  I am still on hold.  I have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight. 

I called back from my cell phone, and someone who sounded so much like the first operator I spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician, and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. When I strongly protested, asked for his name, asked for a number I could call directly, he offered to transfer me immediately, and now, I have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone.

I am starting to sense a trend here. My husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document, has gone off to work to print it there. I am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo, waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call.  

I usually discount negative reviews, but this is really my experience with this product, and if you are considering purchasing it, I would encourage you to think that through a little further."	0
"I received this printer a few days ago and I am very impressed. 4 X 6 photos look awesome as if I had Walmart print them and the speed is very fast. I hook it up to my Airport Extreme Base Station (I use a Powerbook) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all. Scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old HP All in one printer that just kicked the bucket.

The software is easy to use and understand. I never read the directions and I was scanning in pictures with in minutes. I also like the LCD display on the printer. Its nice to just ""pop"" in a memory card, and view the photos you want to print. It saves time when you don't have to download them to the computer then print them.

Overall I am vey pleased and I did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good. I was torn between Canon (I actually bought a Canon Pixma and returned it) and HP and I am glad I stuck with HP, always a trusted brand. And the price was about $40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around.

Pros:
Excellent picture qualty
Fast printing
Easy setup
A lot of features
Easy to use and understand functions

Cons:
Scanner a litte noisy (quieter than my old HP)
When printing the printer shakes my table (old HP did the same)

"I have just up-graded to a 40"" HD samsung 1080p TV so I had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 ""great receiver"" with this 674 model mainly for the HDMI switching capabilities, set-up was a little tricky but after an hour I was ready to try the audyssey set up mic. which was very straight forward & accurate Boy was I blown away.

I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it. The drive has a controller board error.  I contacted Western Digital for a replacement, but they tell me that it is out of warranty.  Apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it.  If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital. With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties, I will never buy Western Digital again	0
"I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.

I choose this cooler after reviewing several of the ""mat"" variety, but chose this one because of its design.  As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook.  This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air.

After setting this cooler up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase.  Qualitatively, the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.  Quantitatively, the notebook experienced a 5C temperature drop at my HD and at my CPU.  Now my hard drive is running at 40C-45C instead of 45-50C!
I would definitely recommend this product"	1
If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3. Turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more, not even close.

Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers	1
"I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.  

Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say,  I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord.  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for"	0

"I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.  

Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation.

The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose.

As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy.

I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk."	0

The first time that I sent it it, my expense, Magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours; and it was not fixed. It still said that I was in Russia and would lock up. The second time that I sent it to them, they sent me a shipping label via email. They had it in their paws for about 2 weeks. It came back said that I was in Peru and then lock up. I have an old Lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal, it always locked on to my location (albeit a little slow), and it worked.

I've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month. First they said that they sent it to me via email, but they said that because I have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my Outlook is rejecting the label. But, I use web based email. Then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail. It's been two and a half weeks and I have not yet received that label. They told me that they sent it out 3 days before Christmas and that I didn't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to Christmas and New Year's. But it's now January. Who knows, maybe I'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008.

I bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and I so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance.  Great idea, bad solution.  The main problem I had was that the camera lens is fixed, and does NOT focus.  I waited 1 hour on the line with D-LINK tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera.  Unfortunately, the ones I got did not focus at all, and the video quality was absolutely terrible (washed out color and bad contrast).

FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well.

"Wow, I'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. Despite the bad reviews, I bought it anyway.  I still believe in a Motorola.  Guess what?  Not bad.  I bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my Siemens.  The Siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago.  This Moto phone has the features most people will ever need.  The shared phonebook is very valuable.  A loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless.  Incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent.  I don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality.  Ok, the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home.  After about 75 meters with 3 walls in between, I can start to hear the voice I'm speaking to, crackles.  I just did this for test but I can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house.  I am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. With regard to the phonebook, I wish I can enter more characters each address!  The maximum characters I can enter is only 11.  I think I can enter about 20 on my Siemens.  Another minor quirk is when someone called, I could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party.  Not with this phone.  I still have to press the ""flash"" bottom everytime before I can start talking.  Build quality is excellent.  It is a little on the heavy side which I like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic.  Even if I squeeze the handset hard, I didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping.  I tried the Pana, V-Tech, Uniden, GE, and ATT in a local store and the Motorola is tops. You will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here.  I personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around.  If you do not see it that way, it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product."	1

"I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.

Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes.

I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response.

I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them. I think they will be OK, now, but I would not have purchased them if I knew they were so poorly manufactured. And, I do not have any good thoughts about Allsop's customer service"	0

"Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks.

Pros:
-----
1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies
2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality
3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design
4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's
5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD's

Cons:
-----
1. Expensive
2. No HDMI output
3. Non-intuative remote control
4. No headphone jack


Overall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung.

I use this on my 23"" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products.

To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room.

The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port"	1

Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not. 	0

"I paid $35 for a barely adequate product case. It does not securely mount or protect the Creative Zen. It is overpriced and underperforms. As others have mentioned, you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player. The set up feature is a joke -- you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band. taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product. The Design engineer should be fired.

For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this	0
"I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one. 

I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer.

As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words ""My Album"" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions.

Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...)

So, I've blown through the provided ""trial"" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing.

I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...)

Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec.

The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.  

The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty."	1

"Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, ""grabbing"" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the ""drift"" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.

If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.

Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller."	1

I must admit I read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive, however... .  I found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items I've tried so far. I initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time (before reading the instructions) . This made things more difficult so I started over, set it for everything to be automatic, including the time, left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its' thing - which it did magnificently. EVERYTHING worked beautifully and it did a great job. I LOVE the one-touch recording. I found it's best to read directions one at a time as I want to try something new and have had no problems. So far I haven't tried everything it will do but find it's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use. It's a joy to hit the TVGuide button, highlight the shows I want to watch and hit the record button. So far I have no complaints	1

Great new product!  Easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player.  I can even use it to record my favorite tv shows.  I highly recommend this product	1
When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced	0
For this price these are a steal! Purchased mine for $15 (with shipping) and let me tell you, it was worth it! The headphones come with a 1/4 converter too!

These are an amazing deal for the price, I'm honestly surprised these arn't marked for $50. Don't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones	1

but the touch wheel is harder to use. 

I bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it. Since that point time I had a harder time turning it off/pausing, adjusting the volume, using the back and forth touch points, and setting a stop point in a audiobook. This is the result of the mini being recessed into the case.

I took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again. The case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for.

Also, make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since I nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip. 

I'll only use when absolutely necessary now."	0
"I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play.

The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable)

The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head.

Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.  

Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way.

Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night.

Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :)
That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player.

Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger.
Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears.

I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit.

I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses.

So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) )

"I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.

On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time.

The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to ""upgrade"" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out"	0
"Still embarking on spooling off all the Hi-8 tapes I have, but I've been VERY satisfied with the Plextor unit so far.  First thing I did was to spool one Hi-8 tape and then make a DVD, using the functionality of the bundled WinDVD Creator software.  Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the DVD I created, on my bedroom DVD player.  Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances.  It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good.  I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc.  Meanwhile, I keep spooling.

I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.

Well worth the price	1
"I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player.

There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it.

My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support.

They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9.

The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector.

"This review is more about the Hi-MD concept in general than one particular player.
The sound quality was excellent.  The rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace.

Complaints:
-The only thing that isn't proprietary is the headphone jack and the AA battery.  Beyond that, Sony's dual role as a content provider (complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players.  No Macintosh support is just the beginning.  Proprietary compression algorithms. Weird and twisted upload/download rules.  Wrong choices made at every point of the PRD process.


-100x recording speed?  Make that 4x on a good day.  100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of Elliot Spitzer, if he only cared.

-The players are flimsy.  Just walking with mine caused it to skip.  And one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely.  Sony will charge you to honor the warranty (parts only--no labor).  By contrast Apple replaced my daughter's iPod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups.

-Trying to find Hi-MDs offers the thrill of the hunt, if you're into that kind of thing.  But their rarity suggests that Sony is at best half-hearted about supporting this device.

I used to be a loyal Sony customer, but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill.  Sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing.  In fact, I'm planning an HD TV purchase next year and have Sony far down on the list of possibilities.  You can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days.

"The reviewer below identifying himself as ""An Electronics Fan"" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose?

The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.

I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them.

About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less.

So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range. 

My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of ""mod"" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality.

So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price"	1

I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.

I liked this charger so much that I ended up ordering a second unit. Premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty! I called Lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what, they sent me another charger without hussle! The call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way, they definetly stand by and back up their warranty. No problems with the second unit and If I ever need another one I would still buy a lenmar. The two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar PPRO-H batteries, one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular NiMH batteries, it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80% level in less than 15 minutes, and the other PPRO-H batteries in about 7-8 minutes. I didn't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the PPRO-H batteries, but the PPRO-H kind are more durable. This charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 V and the first to use NeoTherm� charging technology! it's solid and heavy duty charger, not like the cheap kind that are everywhere.

The cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4X6 photos.  In fact, the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having ""way less"" than standard cartridges, ""less than 50% full"".  On a related note, I asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my  new printer were full, and he said they should have been full standard cartridges.

So this value pack isn't such a great value now, is it? "	0

"I will never buy a brand new product release from Linksys again. Their Q.C. stinks. I am on the third WRT54GX4 router and it is the first that was not defective. I got it set up and tried my new WPC54GX4 network card(SRX400) and got a weak signal, but I had my second laptop with a WPC54GX card(SRX200) on the desk getting 100% signal strength. I switched cards in the two computers, and the old SRX200 card was better in either computer(both XP Pro). After hours with semi-English speaking techs, they came to the same conclusion I came to in five minutes...a bad antenna in the new WPC54GX4. So once again Amazon will replace a defective Linksys product for me. I had been a Linksys fan in the past, but not any more. Here's a link to a picture of the first router I got and its defect.

"This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push ""open"". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose ""dvd"" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!

"I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.  

The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor.

I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great	1
I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken.

"I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are ""user-friendly"".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.

First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap ""watered down"" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.

I bought a yellow ""psyc"" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.

I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them. "	0

"This Sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don't have your laptop, or a dictionary handy.  The interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device.  Moreover, the access times for Dictionary and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the ""phrase search"" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable.  There are also ""crossword puzzle"" and ""anagram solver"" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine.  Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.

The only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen, but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries.  Hopefully Sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the PW-E550.  

I believe this is BY FAR the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than $100, and no, I do not work for Sharp Electronics"	1

"Our Oskar Multimedia Storage Cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the ""J"" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact.

We had ordered our Oskar Storage Cabinet through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the ""J"" shelf. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through.

So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new ""J"" shelf to my home - at no additional charge. The shelf arrived within the promised ten-days.

This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard, so as not to split the center shelf. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood Storage Cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed. I would love to have three or four more of these units."	1
I was tempted by the low price of this item. The only reviewer before me gave it a 5-star rating. Although aware of the unreliability of a single review, I decided to gave it a shot, and paid $10 for shipping--no other way since it's sold through a third party. $28 later, I was holding the biggest $#!* I've seen in a while! The construction feels very cheap, and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old. And the worst of all, only one of the two microphones worked. Even the one that works is horrible--the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic. It uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics, and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?  I'll probably have to eat the $33, since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns. Well, I learned a lesson...things are cheap for a reason	0
I used this recorder alot, I have alot of classes,and the playback is good, it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record.  The sound quality is good, 36h record time which can be broken up to folders.  The only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume, i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low,and that goes vice versa as well,. Nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	1
"Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is ""fully charged"" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back. 

Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option."	0

"The Pros: 

-You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive.

-It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well.

-Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on)

The Cons:

-Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen. 

-If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen.
 
-It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied.

-After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it. "	0
This is a great product for those who probably don't write too much.

This has been the best investment I've made for quite some time.  After experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit Hawaii last year and having my computer die, I invested into this unit.  I read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken.  I thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so I'm going to try it and see.  Sure enough this unit came with no problems.  I plugged it in and let it charge over night.  I then added my computer and my monitor to it.  I've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and I'm so thankful that it has saved my computer.  If anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers.  I fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge	1
This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.

"This item is BR1500, which also called RS model vs. the BX1500 called XS models.  External battery BR24BP can be used for both BR1500 and BX1500.  The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing ""rolling black"" in the summer.

There are basically 2 differences between the Back-UPS RS(BR1500) and the Back-UPS XS (BX1500) models besides their names.


1. The Back-UPS RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-UPS XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection.

2. The Back-UPS RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-UPS XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-UPS XS model it will only go to battery.


*AVR Boost: The UPS is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low.

**AVR Trim: The UPS is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. 

BX1500 does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range.

Please note this is called ""backup UPS"", not the ""smart UPS"" line.  Backup UPS does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power.  ""Smart-UPS"" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt.

For most computers, the ""backup-UPS"" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When ""backup-UPS"" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact.  But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave.  I would not recommend use this UPS for A/V equipment"	1

"I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....  

2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.

"I did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. The things that sold me on it were :

        3. I love the fact that it's ""folder view"" , all my music on my PC is   organized by Artist then Album anyway, so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.Which leads to.................
        4. Just copy mp3's & avi's on there like a removable USB drive.
        5. A/V out to TV is cool.
        6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra.

So far it's played every avi i've thrown at it. 
I've got 15GB of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car !
I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !)
Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade.
I'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.

"I've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters. One of them was on an older Dell laptop,installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a Linksys WRT54G router with WAP encryption.
The problems really started showing when I tried to install the second and third adapters, both on desktop computers running Windows XP SP2. The software installation was a breeze, but when I plugged in the adapter - nothing happened. Connect to network...which network? Scan..who? What?
It looks like this adapter has a very, very short range and doesn't work very well a wall or two in between the routers. It would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one. But then it would find it again, and on and off.
Never really worked as expected on the desktops, so I've given up. I've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times. Downloaded the updated software from Belkin's site, and still have connection issues with the desktops. The laptop works fine as long as I don't take it one room away from the router.
Avoid at all costs please. I've used other wireless devices with the same router that I'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all.
Spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent. Spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing.

This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	1
"I bought an Airplay2 from am Apple store for around $60.

"Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) 

This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. 

These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. 

The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound.

This has a nice size screen. It only has 3 buttons.Play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. I was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. I just found this out by trial. There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. The volume control is on the side, as well as the power button. It could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me	1
"I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features.
Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable.

"The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price	1

"What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way.

When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house.

I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers.

"Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!

I ended up getting two of these A/V cables to hook up my Sony DVD player to my TV via a Terk VS-4 switch.  The picture is phenomenal!!  I plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my VCR & my cable box.  These A/V cable are worth EVERY penny that you spend on them!!  You can't go wrong with Monster Cable!"	1
"First of all, I am a dyed-in-the-wool techie.  I design products like this in my job.  I know what every single one of those ""what the heck is that?"" settings in router set up screens are.  So I do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router ""MORONS"".  

Yes, I got it to work.  It will work right out of the box IF used with most pre-N wireless cards and, definitely, if they are Linksys pre-N cards.  That covers about 1% of those who would buy this router.  After three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default, I succeeded in getting it to ""hand-shake"" with b and g mode cards most of the time.  It would still randomly lose the IP requiring rebooting everything.  Not something my customer would accept nor would I sell.  

Some of the techie specs are a long way from what Linksys claims. Linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both.  They failed.  A non-techie spec important to everyone is range.  It has 20% the range of an old b mode Linksys router I had sitting right next to it.  Adding encryption dropped range in half again!  The wired router portion of it works out of the box, no adjustments required.  But you're buying this for the wireless function.  

Yes, I could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with.  But Linksys didn't used to be that way.  I used to buy only Linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware.  This is the third Linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or DOA.   Then why did I buy this one?  It was on sale and I wanted to give Linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good.  They've now lost it for good.  I exchanged the router for a Netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards.  Plus it was a lot less money.  

Has Cisco ruined Linksys?  Got me.  Did all the good engineers cash out?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for Wall Street?  You bet!  I'll stick with Netgear and Belkin from now on.   "	0
This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great	1
I ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to Amazon.  And I advised them why.  The THX 800 cable is not blue.  The THX 600 cable is blue.

"The material and ergonomics of this phone is average.  The selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line.  Below are the factors that I considered before purchasing and my experience:

Range:  The range of the phone is very good.  I can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop.

Call Quality:  Average.  I have a Plantronics CS50 wireless headset that is on the 900 Mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit.  The call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear.  When I have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset, or vice-versa, callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call.  The Uniden is much more muffled and less clear.  It is however comparable to most cordless phone.  Not exceptional, but not bad.

Durability:  Average.  I have dropped my handsets on rare occasions, they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well.  One of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor, which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn't scratch the hardwood floor.

Special Note:  I suffered a power outage during a major windstorm.  The base unit will not boot up.  This appears to have happened to other reviewers.  This problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house.  On this issue, I have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars"	0

"This is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their Mac a lot of mileage.  I'm in law school, so I'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks, keys, and other junk.  My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war.  The Speck case protects the MacBook's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way.  Normally, if you put a Mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD.  The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard.  Plus, if you put a red case on a white Mac, people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red Macs.

Cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off.  Also, dust starts to collect under the bottom case (static?), so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean.  Fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning. "	1
Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.

"I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The ""bulb"" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine"	1
This transmitter requires me to remove the case from my iPod 5G.  Even with the case removed the device doesn't fit snugly and works it way loose as I am driving.

Wow! I didn't trust the other review.  I needed a mini amp, so I decided to bought this one, because of the price and of the dual purpose.  Right out of the box, it actually smell bacon!! Amazing, it was true!  And not only that.  If someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp, and don't want to stop, this is the mini amp for you.  Can't believe the speaker in it.  And, about the disto, well, is OK for practice. Won't regret about it.	1
Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.

"I purchased this item on 6/3/06 from Amazon, and a 250GB ATA/IDE Hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor. It all went together fine and I could mount the volume easily enough.

The first thing I noticed is that it's wi-fi wouldn't work with WEP with my Powerbook. It'd work without encryption on the Airport Extreme, but not with WEP or with WPA. I noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days. I noted it wouldn't hold time at all consistently. It wouldn't register a network time server's data and was always in the wrong time zone, so I had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time, but it would still drift about ten minutes per day, and then jump an hour or two randomly, making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy.

I found it slow to mount, and it would sometimes unmount over working WEP wi-fi or hardwired Gigabit connections, which was disheartening. I then decided to call Tech Support, which is when things went from bad to worse...

Calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff. The tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around, which too up to another thirty minutes. Folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails. 

After *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released firmware update, it would work with WPA_PSK or open, but still no WEP. They couldn't fix the time drift issue. I repeatedly asked for a replacement, but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through, whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time, or another firmware update... they just wouldn't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until I was ready to scream. By this time, I was out of Amazon's return policy timeframe.

They refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts. I even sent a letter, telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or I'd post my experience here on Amazon. Of course, I got a replacement unit with no other reply.

Now I've got to get rid of the thing oneBay or whatever, take the loss and move on. I would never buy another D-Link product. I would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax.

I bought an Iomega NAS unit, which works very well, has multiple drives and RAID and, though it costs more, provides decent value and it WORKS.

D-Link has a lot to learn about customer service and should NOT release beta, untested products to the consumer market. Shame on them"	0
I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box	1
"It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named ""ilegally"" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt ""OK""?.  ""OK"" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  ""OK"" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box.

When you look at the price, it may seem pricey but when you get the product, there is some serious engineering involved.  The web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason I bought an Ergotron.  The attention to detail is incredible.  Mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job. Other than that the installation was flawless.  This is a very solid and well machined.  Kudos to Ergotron.

Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon	0

This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one	0
When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red.

I've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color  cartridges. Four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two  weeks.

After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort	1
Despite careful aiming, this has exactly, and I mean exactly, the same signal strength as my cheapie $6 Airlink 7db omni, and is weaker than my homemade Pirouline cantenna. Probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap, but save your money if you're expecting 15db performance	0

Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price	1
Have used many types of dvd-r. This the only one I have found that didn't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable. Tried different locations on the spindle and the same results. Would have been a good buy if they worked. Gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star	0
"I was ready to take this player back to the store!  I checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to ""how to"" videos.  This was the best thing I could have found.

Who would hide folders anyway?  Nonetheless I now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer.  Like others have said the photo option is not that great so don't buy it for that.  I mostly want it for working out so pics don't make much of a difference to me.  DH has a 30G ipod so if I wanna see graphics I can just borrow that lol!

I have had other APC battery backup's in the past, and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit.

"As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.  

Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is ""hinged"" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy. 

The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with"	0
"     I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40"" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later.

     Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.
     I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.
     In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy"	1
"I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness. 

Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department. 

If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet"	0

"I have been using this mouse at work since it came out. After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail.  I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls.  The best feature of this mouse is the battery life.

I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in.

I don't know where the guy below got that this card doesn't work with Windows Media Center Edition because I just installed the latest XP drivers for the card on Media Center Edition 2005 and it works perfectly.

"My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations.  In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches.  I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower.  I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen.

The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days.  At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop).  I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again.

I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW."	0
"First off... I like this unit.  It's EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them.  All you need to do is place a blank AUDIO CD into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause.  It starts recording instantly.  Between each song, hit a button and it break the recording into tracks.  Pretty cool!

It's got great potential, but there are still a few shortcomings.  For example, I was surprised to see that it doesn't let you record off of the radio.  Just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn't digital. It's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations.  You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago.

I wouldn't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets.  This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too.  Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button.  They should just label it the ""Radio"" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial.

Another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all.  So you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers.

I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can't use half stars, I'll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it's shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives.

Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options.

1. A standalone CD-Recorder.  I have one of these too.  The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck.  In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other.  Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It's easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers).  In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable.  I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit.

2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot.

3. A portable digital recorder like the iKey Plus.  I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it.  You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola!  It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive.  If you do go that route, make sure you get the ""Plus"" model.  The older model is outdated and doesn't work as well.

4. Use a PC.  Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it's out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a recording, nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I'm trying to use it for that matter.

Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite audio software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3."	1
Followed the instructions to the letter.  PCs would not work once connected and even worse stopped XP starting up - had to go back to restore point.  Belkin email support is next to useless.  I would strongely recommend buying a KVM product from another supplier	0
Right price and works off of USB!  The sound is terrible on MacBook so this will fill in nicely	1
Besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned, Belkin support is horrible. The automated system consistenly disconnects the call, requiring going through their operator. My 4-port KVM stopped functioning after six months. There's no information on the web to help either. It's as if there IS no way to fix a KVM that doesn't work. Flash upgrading is a joke. I followed the procedure directly from Belkin's website. So I had to RMA replace it. Trust me, Belkin doesn't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall. Go with IOGEAR - they include all the cables with the KVM switch for the price of Belkin's without cables	0
"I bought this cute little speaker from Walmart (14$) and it is so compact and very useful. It also matches with my other speakers of Sony Dream system.

"The best thing about the Magellean 3000T is the large screen.  
Sometimes this gadget works like a charm--other times it just seems to pay no attention.  Actually, the touch screen function decides not to work.

First, I called Magellan's help line (the phone number was hard to find); apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon.  If you hear a click, it's okay.

"So I received my Go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box.

I agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download. In this day and age, there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers.

Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.

"I had looked at numerous stands for my Yamaha keyboard and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand (at professional prices).  With that in mind, the Yamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand is a good choice at $29.99.  I had seen other stands that were not as sturdy (single X stands)and cost about the same price.

Tips for assembly: 
- Don't read the instructions, just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on Amazon and assemble the stand the way it's shown.
- The bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand.  Use the (included )Allen Wrench to remove them.

PROS:
- Low price.
- Solid, sturdy stand.
- Works for just about any keyboard.
- The stand's height is fully adjustable, and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything.

CONS:
- There is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand.  No screws, bolts or straps are included, even though most (including my Yamaha) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand.  The keyboard simply sits on top of the stand.  I was VERY disappointed about this.
- The included Allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts.  The bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool.  The Allen Wrench only stripped the bolt, it did not loosen it.  Luckily my husband had a better Allen Wrench of nearly identical size, and that one worked.  Without it, we would not have been able to loosen the bolt"	1

"I bought the Archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family. The device didn't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation.
My opinion quickly changed when I ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it. While I was able to download and synchronize (via Windows Media Player) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn't recognized as a USB device anymore and also froze the ""external hardware"" management function on my PC.  Right now I cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive, and so far customer service at Archos has not been able to help me, blaming the problem on driver issues on my PC (seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops), a  really frustrating experience.

"I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment.  I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM).  In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision.  On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector.  This is with Vista x64.  I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund.

If you don't want to wait for their sale, this is an excellent bargain. The print surface has done very well with the inks from my Epson Photo R-220	1

We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft. At first it worked like a charm, but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason.

I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :	1
"Beware of KINGSTON rebates!

Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.

I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).

The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1 � business cards when flattened.  No problem.

About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying ""your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer.""

Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.

After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.

If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.

For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.

Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.

Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.

I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams"	0
The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon	1
My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one	0
"I looked at all the different cases for my new iPod with video, and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case.  So I bought it.  it exceeds my expectations.  It's fantastic.

My ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof.  This helps when down the road I might want to sell it.

The screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable.  I like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch.  

The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it.

I bought the case on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it.  2 days! Amazing.

"I gave my son a Garmin 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any ""big"" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!

It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)

Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?

2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, ""NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)"". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages"	1

"Received the product, it was not fully functional.  The buttons worked but the mouse would not track.  I loaded the software, trouble-shot everything, even put up with maddeningly insane questions from Kensington tech support (""Did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in?"")  However, Amazon.com was very quick and gracious in the return.  

Remarking on the design: seemed to fit well in my hand, though it was a bit bulky; usb cord was very long -- a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach; might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly.

"I have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps.  Unlike the reviewers before me I have a normal size hand.  Over the years I have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist.

I saw this ""ergonomic"" Natural mouse advertised on Microsoft's website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available.

The mouse caused instant pain in my wrist.  I tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking I just had to get used to the mouse.  My wrist pain just got worse.  After a week the pain in my wrist was so bad I wasn't sure it would ever go away.  Not only did I have pain while using it but for days after stopping.  Although I have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb.

I've had this phone less than a week, but I have been pleased with it's performance so far. The set up was somewhat tricky, as many, if not all Skype addresses use a period in the address. None of the literature showed how to find the period. By accident I noticed it was available on the 1 button. After discovering that, the installation went flawlessly. If one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad, one would have no problems. If one is learning on this phone with the literature provided, one needs help.

"They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth. 

Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out."	0
These are the only reliable disks I have found.  I began a collection of Friends on my dvd-rws.  I have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks.  I rewatch all my favorite episodes, of which I have over 100 and have no problems.  These are the best	1
"The cord design of these is terrible.  You'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from  your right ear to your attachment point.  This is especially agravating for RIGHT HANDED individual (pshh hardly any of those).  Why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player (or whatever) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short.  I always use the extra extended cable, which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use.

The sound is good for the price (doesn't compare to my normal set of headphones), but sporadically I feel like they are hurting my ears (not in a physical sense).  I have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or (more than likely as I've never had this before with other headphones) improper sound design of the speakers.

We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises ""Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels.""

A wonderful quality of experience is the near ""instant on"" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. Its time delay was also a disadvantage. I think most people will be very happy with the HP.

"The only thing I will say about the BDP-S1 is that it is top quality.
Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software.

Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow (Blu-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that Blu-ray will win.

You see, I have both Blu-ray and HD DVD.
I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 Blu-ray movies. 

In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software.

But here is where the similarities end.

1) Blu-ray is more durable. 
The BD movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them.
On the other hand, the HDDVD movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the HDDVD movies are scratched, but NONE of the Blu-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my HDDVD movies, that really upsets me!!!!!

2) Blu-ray costs less to BUY.
What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman HDDVD is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed HDDVD is $28.
Now the HDDVD DUAL format has both a standard DVD and HDDVD movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an HDDVD to watch a 480p picture? 

Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba HDDVD player. 
Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 Blu-Ray disc player. HDDVD will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats.

3) Blu-ray has more capacity.
For less money, you can get a 50GB Blu-ray movie versus a 30GB HDDVD movie.

And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB?
HDDVD can go up to 51GB.

"This little scanner is not worth the price. It's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use. There is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency, large gaps in between the frequency ranges it's programmed to receive, and very limited memory capabilities. The small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device, looking from any angle and the backlit LCD display is unreadable. 

Reception of this scanner is poor on all of it's (very limited) bands, though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna. The scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources. The squelch is practically useless on this thing, it's either on or off, it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full, as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it's set just above the static level on any empty frequency. The sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding, but at least there is a jack for an external speaker.

On the bright side, the chassis is well built and strong, the buttons have a decent feel, not to light nor too stiff. The knobs turn with ease, but will not change their settings due to road vibration, they stay put where you set them at.

I needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal. Instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item.	0
"I agree with the comments posted here.  Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied.

The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out Bose entirely.  I wanted a top-loading door like the old Bose models but also the ability to play MP3 like the new ones, and this gave me both.  The sound and punch is remarkable.  At flat setting, it is a bit bassy, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom.  Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic.  10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night!

TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping.  A sweet deal for a sweet machine."	1
this thing doesn't work, nothing but black and white image and off center.  my video card is ntsc like it said but won't work on the 3 computers i have.  don't buy this, buy a video converter box	0
"I didn't want to fork over 500 for a BOSE or Boston Acoustics, or even 350 for a Cambridge Soundworks, and then I found this little gem, for about 175 + shipping.  I've had it for a few days, and so far I am impressed.

The SX  functions are very intuitive, easy to set the time and both alarms.  I thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the CD player compartment, no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm!  The alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated, which is great.  The buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them, and the CD, AM/FM tuner, and AUX buttons will glow when they are active.  The volume control and tuner knobs are recessed, but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges I suppose.  The snooze/sleep button is a good size.  The sleep function can be toggled for 90, 60, or 30 minutes.

The range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the SX.  The speakers measure about 2.5 inches, and with the volume turned up, you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit.  I like that it has adjustable bass and treble, which can vary from -5 to +5.  I have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great.  It doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system, but definitely rivals my Sony bookshelf system.

The MP3 player on the SX could be better, but is adequate.  During playback, the LCD will scroll to display the filename, title, artist, and track.  It can be programmed for up to 64 tracks, but I haven't had the time or patience for this.  Instead, I just numbered the MP3 tracks in the order I wanted before burning them to the CD-rom.  The repeat function works well, and you can choose either to repeat one track, repeat all tracks, or repeat just one folder.  However, the shuffle function is rather limited, as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an MP3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music), and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once.

One of the things I looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack, and it also has a jack for headphones.  I have my laptop on my nightstand right now, and it playing MP3s on winamp sound great plugged into the SX.

There are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit LCD.  The default level cannot be changed or dimmed, and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow.  Takes a little while to get used to, but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight I guess.  It is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small, and the brightness of the LCD can kind of drown out the analog display, but then again I wear glasses so I suppose I have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes.  When the radio or CD player is in operation, the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control.

One other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup, and you will notice this is the case with many Japanese units, including the Sony clock radios.  I guess the power grid in Japan is really stable, so they don't have use for this, but still, it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery.  On the other hand, I was informed by TEAC tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for ""up to 3 hours"".  I haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold, but I can say that I did unplug the clock for about a minute, and when I plugged it back in, sure enough the time and alarms were still correct.

Overall I am really impressed by this unit.  The only thing that could be better is if the MP3 player shuffle had a few more options, but I guess this is ok as many I have seen MP3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all!  Also, I wish the LCD backlight could be adjusted a little more.  It is a bit pricey at just under 200, but I have heard many clock radios, and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the TEAC SX"	1
I ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when I received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order. The increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from $9.35 to $14.93. All the cartrides arrived within a day of each other. I would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones.	0
"I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear.

That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy"	1
Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks.  First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product	0

"I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do!  But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware.  I know, I know:  do it in recovery mode!  Whatever that is!  (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!)

And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and ""Good bye"" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open).  I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use.  Maybe the Mac Nation is right.

And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan!

"I use my LX4 2.1 system as my desktop PC speakers. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the LX4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8"" stereo to two 1/4"" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. I wasn't used to speakers with crossovers, where only the each type of speaker (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup.
If you are looking for speakers that play really loud, or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie, these are not for you. But if you want incredibly accurate PC speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. You will not be disappointed if you buy the LX4 for your bedroom or for computer use"	1
At first I loved the compact iAudio player, but after the first week, the earphone input (hole in the player), didn't hold the input jack securely, resulting in no sound.  I could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second, but could not get it to work continuously.  Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and box, or I would return it	0
"Amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones. The different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear. 

when I first got them I put the smallest buds on first and thought I had just bought the worst headphones. So I tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold.

And just let you know I ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just don't fit righ"	1

"I reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as I haven't authored or copied very many DVDs with it yet.  However, what I have accomplished with it is commendable.  I can copy an entire commercial DVD (Movie + all the extras) under 50 minutes.  I have composed a Slide show DVD with my own MP3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it.

So far, no coasters.  I am now in the process of producing DVDs of my old 8mm home movies.  The converter is giving me more problems than anything.  Still recommend the PX-755UF for anyone interested in an external burner.  Installation was a snap (plug-n-play)"	1
The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks	0
These fit over everything very well, and they stayed put without stretching out, which is why my original pads fell off.  I guess it's one of those products that you can't do much better than $10 for, but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something..	1
"Not only was this difficult to set up (even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from Belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases) but once I finally managed to get it to work (by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip) it had practically no range whatsoever; in fact, my MacBook Pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75% signal, and once the threshold of the room was crossed, the signal disappeared altogether. A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink ""home networking"" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly. Anyway, I hope that there are enough UPS trucks in America to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require."	0
I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV	1
"Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the ""user manual"" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy"	0
"Got this drive a few weeks ago for an Apple Power Mac G4 Cube.

"I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this ""upgrade"" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers. 

To be fair Tom (tech support) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time. However, until then I have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever. If my wife was not already used to the unit I would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer. 

In summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don't expect good customer service if you need Magellan's help."	0
"We now have three of the K850 printers in use, one with a built in print server, second paper tray, and duplexer.  So far, the printers have proved to be reliable, fast, and comparatively inexpensive to operate.  Power on, pre-print, and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer.

Capable of using the same HP 10 black and HP 11 individual color ink cartridges, as well as replacement print heads as the HP Business Ink Jet 1100d and HP Business Ink Jet 1200d, the K850 shares the same low, per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers.  Full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds, with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph.  White horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph, possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads, shipped with the new printer, are defective.

The printer handles paper sizes up to 13"" x 19"", so it easily handles B size (tabloid, 11"" x 17"") paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters.  The printer software installs without problem, although a reboot will likely be required.  For network capable K850 printers, the software install automatically finds K850 printers on the network, and adds a ""HP Standard TCP/IP Port"" to the computer configuration for communication with the printer.  For non-network capable K850 printers, both USB and parallel port connections are supported.

Positives:
* Uses ink that is compatible with other printer models, helping to keep operating costs down.
* Fast printing for full page color, and even faster black printing with spot color.
* Large format color printing, which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints.
* Nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced, printing stops automatically, user replaces ink cartridge, and printing continues.
* Separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement, larger capacity ink cartridges, and lower operating cost.

Negatives:
* Minimal install of HP software from the CD requires at least 100MB.
* Low capacity HP 13 print cartridges ship with the printer.
* Power-on, pre-print, and post-print noise, just like the Business Ink Jet 1100d and 1200d.  However, there is very little noise produced while printing.
* Cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges, similar to that used on the 1200d.
* Large footprint"	1

I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!   	0

I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity	0
"I bought this mount for a philips 42"" plasma TV.  The TV weighs probably about 100LBs.

  I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts.  

  The mount was put on our living room wall by a ""handy man"" because i didn't have a stud finder.  He was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic.  The mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured.

  The 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the TV sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house.  The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal.  None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern.  I took the cables and made a 1"" ""trunk"" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories.

  The TV sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt.

  I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong.  It also looks nice and stays well hidden.  Its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the TV easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables).

"I bought this product to hang a 42"" LCD.
I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32"" wide.  The ""virtual axis"" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32"" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16"" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42"" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50""+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy."	1
I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews.

"This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best?
1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen. 
2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video.
3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc.
4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune.
5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps.
6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive.
7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own.
8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys. 
9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations.

"I bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive I was using crashed and took my backup with it.  

The Maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes.  The initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too.  So far, so good.  The problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files! 

The scheduled backup doesn't work at all.  The light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup ANY new or updated files.  

The synch is useless too.  It's like the backup function.  It will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to.  It's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it. 

To get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files I have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as I have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new.

I would NOT buy this product again.  It's not an automatic backup drive, it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable AT ALL.   

If you need a backup drive look elsewhere. Sorry to say, this one is a complete waste of money."	0
This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away.  I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them.  This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully.  When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price.  If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product.  I have nine cams installed at three locations.  Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once.  The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more.  I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear.  Dlink sent my replacement direct.  The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now.  One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features	1
I just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in Vista Ultimate. It claims to have a QAM tuner, but I'll be damned if it can find any digital/HD channels on my cable. My QAM TV gets many. Very disappointed, documentation is at best lacking. Look elsewhere.	0
"I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again.

I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this:

This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi.

All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer"	1
"Functions absolutely flawlessly under Vista 64bit (unlike most other cards such as my older WinTV PVR-150).  If not for the next paragraph, I'd give it five stars for just this.  Heck, it does better under Vista x64 than my old card did under WinXP 32.  (Disclaimer: I tested the analog video only, not the digital.) 

But I discovered that it was running extrememly HOT, even when just sitting their idle.  So hot that you literally can't even touch it.  Ouch!  I ended up removing it from the case as I didn't trust it. Perhaps it's a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it's not in use.

"If you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over.  If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard AM/FM you might like this tuner. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals.  The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice!  The HDT-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other tuners won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. 

Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD.  Their stations sound good and most of the FM's are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/FM stations.  I hope the get even more adventurous. 

My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or FM.  I don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner, it's the HD system and just like FM did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about FM drift) .  I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this"	1

"I bought this router hoping that some of the quality in Cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child Linksys.  Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.

That being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.


Pros:

This router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.
The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.
Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective ""black hole"" on my IP for most uninvited packets.

Cons:

Not all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.
Turning on the poorly documented ""firewall"" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds ""port closed"" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds ""port closed"" to some and ""port open"" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with ""firewall"" inactive).  I'm not sure how the ""firewall"" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.
The router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.
Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.

For what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.  I probably will not buy another Linksys, but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return.

"I must admit, the first review posted here on the D320 made
me a little nervous.  My experience is quite different, and
after several months of ownership I am quite pleased.

I'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review, as
that's the only point of reference (so far):

1) Yes, pick up a USB cable,

2) Printer driver installation on Win98 essentially required no
   user intervention.  With WinXP however, I do seem to recall
   having to muck with it more, but I'm hazy on the details now,

3) I have printed scores of multi-page documents, many over 15
   pages without any problems whatsoever.  I've had no spills
   or jams of any kind,

4) I have not seen any ""paper-curl"" problems whatsoever,  

5) I leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at
   all times as I have no problem with it.  For doing many
   two-sided copies, it is indeed easier to place the copies
   back into the paper cassette.  But that's my experience with
   any copier I've used.

6) Making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as I
   expected.  I've simply experienced no problems.

7) I've experienced no copier caused misalignments.  If my 
   copies have been crooked, it was because I set them on the
   glass improperly.

I am very happy with this unit.  It copies as I expect it to, 
and prints just the same: quickly and without event.  It's been
able to properly print from all Windoze applications I've thrown
at it, and ones many users may not even be using, such as
Ghostscript, Acrobat, SecureCRT, PAF, and all image viewing
software I've tried.  And I've got several machines networked
together (Win98 and WinXP) that can all print to the D320 fine
using printer sharing.

BTW, the D320 comes with a full, 3500 page toner cartridge too,
not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers"	1
"As you may have read elsewhere, this router has a problem with the GRE protocol used by Microsoft for their PPtP server (see Alan Bryant's May 27, 2004 review).

This will stop you using it with the built-in PPtP VPN client/server which is provided with Windows 2000/XP.

Here is the text of a complaint I have submitted to Linksys...


""I am attempting to operate a Microsoft PPtP server behind a BEFVP41 (firmware 1.41.1). I have PPtP Pass Through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed IP address of the server but the router refuses to pass the GRE protocol used by Microsoft (Protocol 47).

In answer ID 737, you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with GRE. It does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. GRE does not use TCP/UDP port 47, it is 'Protocol 47', something entirely different.

It seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem.

I and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the BEFVP41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the GRE protocol correctly.

Can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? This is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product.

I also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in IP protocols than myself.""


I await a reply from Linksys as I write this review.


Having said all that, if you have no interest in running the Microsoft PPtP server, the BEFVP41 may do everything else you require. 

It functions okay as a basic NAT router and it's stealth capabilities are good (Steve Gibson's 'Shields Up' reports 'True Stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host).

The in-built IPSec tunneling works well. I am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of BEFSX41's very reliably.

The web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually.


To summarise:

A reasonable basic NAT router.

Very good stealth.

IPSec tunneling works okay (at least to other Linksys products).

Microsoft's PPtP server will NOT work with the current firmware version.  "	0
"I struggled between this and the shure e2c. I decided on the e2c, after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3. This one has the least clarity, but wonderful bass. If I don't listen to as much classical music, I'd definitely pick vmoda vibe. It makes even terrible pop songs sound cool.

I had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason, and I had an extremely hard time putting it in, even with the help of my bf. The vmoda did not come with any foam, only the silicon ear pieces. I settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c"	1

At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.

I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money	1
I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.	0

"Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going.  I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse).  I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive.  I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up.  I went and found my niece...""Uncle XXXX, why does the screen look all funny""  The units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange.  I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem.  We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers...""dude, these %&#!"".

Forget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks.  (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC).  The Rino 530's simply don't work well.  A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic.  $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem.  Frankly, the GPS is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes.  You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later.  The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked.

I spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected.  Every seven minutes?  Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that.  Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, ""Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can.  If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises.""  He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the LCD and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution.  Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases.  I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair.  

I've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most.  This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache."	0

"I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use.  But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two.  In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the ""3:00"" position on the dial.  And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation.  It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time!  Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless.  I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead.  Even if it costs more.  Why spend money on something that doesn't work"	0

"This is my second set of Garmin radios.  I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's.

First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features.  The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate.  My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes.  I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models.  We do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top.

The new compass is also helpful.  With the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right.  After calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass.  I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down.  You can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point.

As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side.  I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do.  If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad.  I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications.

Lock up problem.  I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them.  I did the Garmin update and have not had the problem since.

Overall these new 530's are GREAT.  I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week.  Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group.  Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter.  We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours.

If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!!

"I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.

It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea. 

For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.

I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit."	0
"I had researched for a long time before I finally made my purchase. The final reasons for this purchase was the Consumer Reports Best Buy recommendation for the larger 42"" version of this Olevia set. I had debated about purchasing a TV with 1080 but decided against doing so when I read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. I needed the 37"" set due to the entertainment center we already owned, which cost 2.5 times the price of the TV, so it wasn't leaving the house. The TV opening would have allowed a 40"" but I am glad I stayed with the 37"" because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40"" because of the need to turn the set at angles. I compared the two TVs at the Olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. I also saw the Olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. The best price was found through Amazon.com. I placed my order on a Friday evening and the set was delivered by UPS in perfect condition on Wednesday. The set-up of the TV was simple. The only problem I experienced was with the remote. Here's the good news: I sent an email to tech support and quickly I had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that I set-up the TV. Even though I use the surround sound through our stereo, I actually was satisfied with the sound through the TV speakers. A small problem is that the Time Warner Cable Box remote control does not operate the TV, so we do have to use multiple remotes, but that's only a minor inconvenience. Our family has been very pleased with the TV. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone purchasing this size TV."	1

It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting ""fix"" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.

If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.

I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.  

If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere"	0
It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too	1
"I purchased this item per other recommendations and that of Stereophile magazine, thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting iTunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home.

First, reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the Transmitter.
Second, I tried the tweak (turning up the volume pot)suggested in other ratings.  This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer. 
Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.  

In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to ""fix"" it yourself-- don't buy this product"	0
"I purchased the transmitter because I don't have an aux input in my car. The product works well.  I live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio.

One review mentioned the Sansa player won't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on. I use the silicon case to protect my player.  I took off the belt clip that comes with the case.  The player and case fits well enough in the transmitter. "	1

"This CD/DVD holder is sturdy and stylish.  I needed something to look nice, but hold my stuff, and those wallet-type options weren't really cutting it for me.  

I had also purchased something similiar (not Case Logic) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was.

I now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up.  I plan on getting more as needed.  When they get full, it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder (the other one I purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in).

The only con I can think of is the price.  For me, it's worth it, but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints"	1
Don't buy these batteries, because they don't last long like Energizer or Duracell. These Eveready batteries ain't never ready	0
"I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40"" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub.

Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet.

Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!"	1
These batteries didn't last at all. They worked OK in my remote control for my radio, but on everything else, the quality was either below-average or just horrid. My digital camera didn't even turn on with these. Only recommended with low powered devices; actually I'd recommend a Rayovac or an Energizer rather than these. I know they're only heavy duty batteries, but the quality is still below-average	0
I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play.  Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording.  I'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding.  Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG.  The Sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.  Fantastic product guys and for the money it's a steal	1
The overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic.  The sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion. The pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn't have a very good range (very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results).  not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit.  i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of, otherwise i would not have purchased the item	0
"I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, ""much better"" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.

While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored ""Carousel"" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.  

I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.  

With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like ""Star Wars III"" and ""Sin City"" showed incredible detail, and older films like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory.

I highly recommend the HD72."	1
"   For the first few weeks it worked fine, however, it started skipping and stopping DVDs after two months. I called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty, no case number was given at the time. The unit was shipped via UPS and received on 92nd days from the purchase date, and they charged $50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired. I called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because I don't have case number issued within warranty period. In addition, please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well. Next place for my DVD player? Trashcan *sigh*
   Go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit.

"Unless that I made an order for Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution System, I received another wireless system from TERK Co, but the point is that this system is working properly, and right now I'm able to have Greek TV via internet to my desktop, and via the TERK wireless system downstairs to my living-room TV appliance. During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good resolution.

I have purchased over two dozen of these units. This is the best unit for the price. There are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit. This allows you to be certain that your feed is being input. Also the card slots are a plus. Two things to be aware of. If you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in. Also if  you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required. Not a one disc does all unit	1

"Pro ---

* Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row. 
For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard.
To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row.

* The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate. 

Con ---

* The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below).

* Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap. 

The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat ""while on your lap or on a non-flat surface"".
This ""lock"" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8"" along the top of the board from the left half into the right.
Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated ""V"" shape after any amount of light-handed typing. 
HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed.
 
* The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to ""enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC"". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle.
A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right.
 
* The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys.

* It doesn't turn off.


Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch. 

The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch.

What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries. 

The automatic ""sleep mode"" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard.
Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes.

The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly.

Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords ""bluetooth keyboard"". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch.


For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries.
Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user. 
Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row.


How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me.
All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name. 
It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism.
But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name. 
If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400. 
My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq. 

The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality. 
Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves."	0
I'm not a serious piano player, just casual.  Don't have room for a piano, so this serves my purposes.  I just want to entertain myself.

"I bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new HP dv2000 laptop, with internal bluetooth, I was excited about the Instant View feature and the lazer percision, however when I got the mouse connected it worked, but no instant viewer?  Turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the DONGLE pluged in... but... the reason I bought a ""BLUETOOTH"" mouse was in order to AVOID a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop.

On top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are AWKWERD to press, I have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them, nothing like my old microsoft mouses' cozy side button.

The middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three... which is set to activate the ""Amazing"" instant viewer, which is decent, but useless without the dongle.

As far as lazer percision, not too noticable, my Kingston RF lazer mouse seemed to preform better.

The only reason I gave it a 2/5 is the charger is nice, the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish, which feels nice and cool against the palm.

This makes a DECENT desktop mouse, if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice.  Not something I'd recomend for a laptop user.  For the price overall subpar"	0
"The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago.

There's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.  

Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information. "	1

Really stupid design.  It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity).

"When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way.
I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. 
MUSIC:
When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized  my mp3s with the WMP 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read ""Unknown artist and album"". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one ""Portable playlist""  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button.
One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10.
The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound.

PICTURES:
This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you.

VIDEO:
Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me...
I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it ""supports"" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This ""support"" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10.
In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality.
You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC.

So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. 
If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive.

I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months	1
This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype.  Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario.  But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device	0

A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI & 4 dead pixels.  The replacement TV had even more dead pixels & Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon & Visa all gave me a horrible time & no respect.  So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now & still fighting for a refund.  My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection & no worries	0
"I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place,

"Hello,

I purchased the AVIC-D2, XM and the iPod kit from Amazon.  I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup.  After 3.5 hours they failed.  

I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed.  I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II  are not returnable.  It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies.  Had I realized that Amazon would sell me something that I can't return I would have purchased elsewhere.  At this point I will never purchase anything else from Amazon ever again"	0

Horrible. The gears ingage before the tape is even loaded. You have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it's own. When the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done. You can just hear the damage being done. This model destroyed several of my daughters tapes. We really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes, preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly. Thinking maybe I got a defunct one I had Amazon send out another, it too functioned in the exact same manner. Nope mine wasn't bad, their all bad, this model is disfunctional. I've advised Amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly. I wish Amazon direct had good models to choose from, this one is not	0

"I am very happy with my Meridian Color and the other mapsend products I have purchased, however, at first I couldnt get this product to work.

I had no problem getting this software to run with XP (even without the patch), however I couldnt view the basemap I had loaded onto my Magellan.  I tried to address this with the company.  It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails.  Customer service for this product is nonexistant.

I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer.  Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the basemap.  I did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do.

I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though.  Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn.  I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it.  The Magellan Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps.

Get you head out of your a__ Thales.  You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.

However, it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me. I find it's side buttons are difficult to use. They're very small and their action is not to my liking.

Further, I was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using Mac OS X Tiger. The Steer Mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons. I've found nothing that supports those buttons on the Mac platform to date"	0

"I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.  

It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably. 

Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless. "	0
"I don't know what the fuss is all about about this unit's ""fan noise""... After the firmware update, if one bothers to do o it, the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of HUGE storage space (or data redundancy if one should choose to use RAID 1). The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs).

One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the RAID configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac OSX.4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true OSX app... At most I should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities...

The mid-highs and highs sound fine, but I had issues with bass and mid-low response, especially when I plugged it into my computer.

Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus.

The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape	1

I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY	0

"Don't believe the claim that you can ""just plug it in and it's ready to use."" This product is set up for Windows, and the instructions for installing the drive for a Mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the Windows software.

Don't expect any help from Western Digital. If you can actually get connected to them, and your call isn't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so, you'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive. Their web site help is equally useless"	0
"I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:

- syncing is sometimes buggy
- you have to load all podcasts manually
- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you
  arrange them in iTunes

Recent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.

Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets."	1
"This kit is neat; I have to admit that.  It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book.  However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided.  The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself.  Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you.  You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want.  It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy ""scrap book"" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.
However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the materials included"	0

I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed	0
"The design for this headset is ingenious. Every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. It's not really a headset, but a headphone with a detachable headset; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. The microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. The extension cord comes with a volume controller, another very convenient feature. There are also little hangers on the extension cord, which are for attaching the microphone cord. The audio quality is pretty good, throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set, which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality.
****The only thing I have to complain about is the comfort issue. Maybe it's the size of my head, but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples, so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that, this headset is perfect"	1

I'm so technically challenged, and I had no trouble figuring out this system.  I already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. Altogether they were a bit pricey, but worth every penny!  Very easy to understand the directions, and lots of bells and whistles.  Lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description.

"While I have been very pleased with the performance of this product, configuration and setup was very easy, and even updates to the device are easy to do, it's not reliable.

It seems that every 3 or 4 days I lose connection to the Internet. This is a 7 PC network, couple of servers.  There really isn't huge bandwidth being used.  But it is like it gets frozen - you can't ping it, you can't get to anything on the outside like the gateway or DNS servers, and a simple power reset gets it working again.

Nothing is in the log, I have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem.  I have checked all the ideas on Netgear's site without help. I know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night, when no one is using it.  Could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow?

I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format.

I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment.

This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless. The carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself.

"Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong.  Let me explain how this works.

The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just MP3 with a different file extension title.  When you import your MP3s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix.  Yes, OMG.  I think that's funny, and you should too.

The minidiscs themselves are essentially just CD-RWs.  Keep this in mind.  They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed MP3s.  

The product itself is very good.  I've had one for a short while.  I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music.  I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums.  

The controls are VERY simple and effective.  Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD.  Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight.  The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light.

I got this as an alternative to harddrive MP3 jukeboxes.  Most MP3 players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players.  Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me.  Its a solution that suited me well"	1
This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket...	0

I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!!  A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it.  I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio.  So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!	1
I thought this item came with or you had a choice of color. It did not. It is silver with black trim. It is also not very portible, you have to play it while its sitting on a flat, level surface.	0
I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it. I was thinking of getting a galaxy, but why? I have a great radio here	1
"First off the Software is Horrible!! I have XP Media Center and the Win2000 interface program won't even run. The hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer; Now my Cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray, an error message comes up saying I have no active mixer devices available. I spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up. 
The remote is useless, I will have to get a Microsoft remote, and the picture quality using Media Center is POOR at best. 
Save your money and AVOID this item. 
IF YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND INSTALLING NORTON GOBACK OR SIMILAR SOFTWARE TO UNDO THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!"	0
    After doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model,  I decided to purchase this shredder.  So far it was a wise decision.  I have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money.  I have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome.  I put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag, and I can just keep reusing the same bag. It really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working, no jams, etc.  Great Buy!	1
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap	0
There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever	1
"These are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.  

Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.  

The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more. 

The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.

In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long"	0
"I went from the first version of the Audigy2 to this. And it did increase my performace a tiny bit. My old card was going out on me. A lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping. Haven't had any of that yet. :)

I also didn't seem to have the MB problems that were stated in first review. I have a ASRock Dual-VSTA(new one made for Windows:Vista).

With a good Stereo setup this card sounds really nice. I have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker. Only 4 years old, but have seen some really nice ones lately.

A lot of new games coming out have intense sound now. Vanguards sound has crappy options so you can't dumb it down and it can drag a system down, esp one using on board sound.

I would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included Amazons rating too. [..."	1
Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that	0
"FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.

Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer	1
I ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area.  WRONG !!  The light is so DIM, the only thing it might be good for is a night light! This lamp is a good idea, but much too weak to be of any help	0
I use this scanner primarily for text documents and couldn't be more impressed.  You do need text software - I have Textbridge - but I find relatively few errors in the scan, proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient.  Best of all, I don't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk.  Caution - I haven't used it for photos, but it does a great job on text	1
"I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.

After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it"	0

"I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small ""note book"" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product"	0
These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool..	1
I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off	0

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice	0
Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!	1

"I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.

I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!

These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).

Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen."	1

The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.

About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape!

I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.
The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.
The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. 
As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.
I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms"	1
"I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them ""flopping"". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy"	0
"I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.

After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's ""customs broker"" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.

I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.

The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. 

The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.

The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.

Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit"	1
The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist	0
The sheets were just as described and worth the price. Timely on shippng also. Very pleased	1
I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all	0
The Crib sheets were soft, the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress	1
I usually wear size 7M. However, This shoe of size 7M is way too small. I have to return it to AMAZON and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself. I will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear	0
This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.  I highly recommend it to those who don't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress	1
Haven't worn it yet to test the quality however, the structure is all wrong. One leg is more narrow than than the other (I could barely fit my leg into it) and the waist is really high	0
Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced	1
Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong.  Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response	0

I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
"I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance.
It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price.

Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month	0

"I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.

This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)

Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.

I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.

For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money"	1
"This ""pillow"" is an inflated ""U"" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.

Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for."	0
I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience	1
Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes	0
Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.	1
Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company. While we were happy with the quality, our order was missing 2 shirts. Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know, but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. If you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company	0
"I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.

As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing"	1
I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this	0
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.	1
This was a nightmare order.I paid extra for expedited shipping to assure Christmas arrival.Package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until AFTER Christmas -Disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift didn't make it.The shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.They are also impossible to reach-Amazon couldn't even get them on phone.Thank goodness the shoes fit-I can't begin to imagine what a return would have been like.

"I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price, I got them. When she opened them, she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says ""no difference"""	1

The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear	0
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too	1
"I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.

"As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present ""one size fits all,""it becomes increasingly difficult

is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer
to make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit in

"...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called ""Hollywood Heelz,"" I should have known better.
I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone"	0
I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.	1

"I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were ""sheepskin"". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not ""curly and fluffy"" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me "" they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool"" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for!

"It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.  
I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it."	1
These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.

The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16	0
This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud. 	1
They're pretty, but flimsy.  Very light construction.  The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it.  It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off.  Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face.	0
"I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my ""Birks"". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them ""Birks"" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.

I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the ""nice ones"". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.

I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. 

Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.

So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.


I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. So bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did."	1
I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore	0
These are very cute and they fit great.  I wear them all the time	1
Bought one for my new ipod nano, a total disappointment. Very poorly made. Only glued together not stiched up,It already started to go apart. You won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small.  Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out.  It looks pretty but that is all	0
ordering was easy, arrived in 4 days, gloves fit, well and good quality, good buy,recommend  to purchas	1
the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience	0
"When I play basketball, or in the past when I did Jiu-Jitsu then too. Anyway, they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don't pull or cramp. Anyway, I guess they look o.k. too, but who would see them anyway...THEY'RE UNDERWEAR!!!!

take care and good luck"	1
"The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks ""made in China"" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much ""classier"" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the ""string of bubbles"" panty"	0
"I LOVE this shoe! 
It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.

If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.

The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.

HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!"	1
All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money	0
This is not a basket short or soccer short, NO!!!! it's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country... With hot beaches all year, and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities.. That's why i bought it and don't mess the shoppin	1
These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0
"Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 

I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals."	1
"I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i"	0
I have to say, those crocs are the best. they are super confi, and light... I recommend them	1
"I saw the reviews and ordered the bag, the first impression was it looked pretty good! I was happy, if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. I had to trim to remove the hanging threads. There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 

don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 

The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.

On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).

if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag"	0
     These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift, walking on concrete floors	1
First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans.  It was ridiculous.  I went back  to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned. 	0
I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color.  They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors!  The straps are VERY comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining.  The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes.  I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church, where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad!  It's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels, so when you can find them, stock up on them	1
Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund	0
"This purse has a lot of positives going for it:
1. Great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous.
2. The color is very glamorous.
3. It is a deal at this price (although I bought it when it was $5 higher)
4. It is unique and I love it because I am unique :)

In short, I love it"	1
Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available.  Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back.  Bad experience	0
I have arms like a gorilla, so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. They fit even my appendages nicely. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I'm glad I did, for the large is a perfect fit on me, and I'm pretty slender. The material is fairly thin, but not see-through. Overall, I say this shirt is a good value	1
Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory	0
I never seem to have luck shopping for bras, so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read.  They were a great deal and a wonderful fit.  I would highly recommend	1
I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it. 	0
This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal	1
I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.	0
"This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's ""Lecons de Seduction"" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this ""tanga"" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us"	1
I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them.	0
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica	1
Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes	0
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!	1
I was able to track the progress of this item, and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped.  I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me	0
Highly recommend shoe, BUT you might need a larger size than usual. I wear Easy Spirit 7 1/2 W but found this shoe too snug in both width and length, and had to return	1

These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em.Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots.  These shoes are very comfortable	1
"The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap.  I bought
it for my wife to carry ""all that stuff"" to work.  With out the strap it does not work.  I requested another one, got it, no strap.  On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.

"     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.
     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.
     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order"	0

"I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.

I wear low rise jeans, shorts, etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up. I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I'm giving a show or not! They're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. They're very sexy too!

I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. That's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. And... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color!

Go for it!!!"	1
The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night	0
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.	1
I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality	0
As a new 36DD (can't wear underwire) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market.  For the past 5 years (since my surgery) I've been searching for the perfect bra.  I have finally found it! 	1
the material is nice, but the size is too small.  I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee, the sleeve is too short	0
recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials	1
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	0
"A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.

The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.

I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.

My suggestion is to wear them sparingly."	1
I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...	0

I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].

I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.

"Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. 

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. 

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) 

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. 

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. 

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. 

May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! 

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection"	1

Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange.

Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight	1
this product never made it to destination. it was purchased with pants to match(which were pin-striped and didn't) and it was never sent to the recipient, nor was i invoiced, so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point, or even if they intend to send the correct pants??? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday, and the wrong products otherwise, i will not purchase from this seller again	0
These are exactly what I was looking for.  I've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years.  Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement.  After I received my first pair, I ordered enough to last me another 20 years.  I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days.  They are uncomfortable and they cost more	1
Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side	0

These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears.

"The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit."	0

This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available	1
i quesss for the price you cant beat it, but i think it should have said patch leather, or leather pieces, also the size runs larger, than regular coats, xl was really more like an xxl.but like i said for the price you cant beat it, i really should have invested more and got a better coat.  thank you    dlan	0
"I bought these slippers for my mother, who is 5 years post stroke.  She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke.  Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm.
When she wears these out will definitly by another pair"	1

"This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed. 

It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either.

For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target"	0
They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great	1
Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product.	0
The slippers were perfect, exactly what I wanted.  The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do. Thank You very much	1
These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.	0
Great slippers, very comfortable. I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure.  And the black ones are perfect because they don't show dirt like the white ones	1
I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it	0
Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head. 	1

I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard	0

I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee	0
This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable	1

My mother loves these pants.  I know they are for men, but she loves the way they fit her.  They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better. 	1
"When this product came, it says ""girls"" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or ""girls"" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back"	0
"I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.

In effect, they give you ""drawers"" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. 

The 18"" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.

I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.

A standard-sized 21"" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18"" folders, depending on the clothes being packed."	1

This is just the perfect accessory for the CATS costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital. Got this in gray and brown too! Took a while for the product to get here. In fact, I had to re-order because of the delay--but when finally the product arrived, it was worth the wait	1
I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through. It's a blue shirt so I can't wear it to work now. Unacceptable in a shirt of this price	0
Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.	1

i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts, but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good, the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them, and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer	1
I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop	0

I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased	1
"The garment I received was labeled large.  In fact, at best it is a ""small"". The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled"	0

"Item was called ""Fleese"" but was 80% cotton and looked & felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&H.

I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy.

I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg. 	0

I like Bike swimmer jocks. I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?	1

These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites	1
I love the t-shirt because I loved the movie, but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms, this may present an issue for you.  The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit	0

"This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.

These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.

The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great"	0

With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.

I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!	1

I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did	0
This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga	1
Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.

The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back.	0
I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right	1
"This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.

There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.

The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.

There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)"	0
This is a Great Gown for the price. It's comfy, soft, and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. Moreover, it's sexy! Hope yall enjoy	1
The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.	0
"Very happy with this product. They are substantial so they are &quot;suitable&quot; for a Medium or Large and not someone who is Small.
 
 Delivery was fast and it was well packed. Shipping was included, though I didn't realize it until the end of the ordering process."	1
I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars	0

"Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service"	0
These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking.  They are comfortable and a great buy.  A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe	1
Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  This shirt is large in size but very short!  Not what I had expected.  Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter.  I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem. 	0

Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it.	0
"I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being. 

I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall"	1

"These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet ""breath"" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price"	1
Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.	0
Love them.  They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes, and give the right support when doing a lot of walking, but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes	1
I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful. 	0
Having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves, my husband keeps returning to his favorite, the Land's End pinpoint.  Without a doubt, the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! Now, when its time for new shirts, we don't think twice and go directly to Land's End and order.  They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all	1
"I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, ""hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?"" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy. 
They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet."	0
All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also	1
I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment	0

Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier.  Don't buy if you are planning to use immediately.  This is where is I got very discouraged.  Just haven't had the time to play with it so it's sitting in the box	0
I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38. 	1
I ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves Happy Bunny.  The pj's were cheaply made and the pants were very short...it didn't say anywhere in the description that that were capri length.  They were definitely not worth the price	0
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift	1
The product is as described and I'm sure for some ladies the product would be great.  However, for whatever reason, the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and, the material was more see-thru than I desired.  The product is well made with no defects	0
Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for?  My husband was very pleased	1
This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture. Loose threads on it. Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift.  I wouldn't recommend this item.  It definitely cost more than it was worth	0
My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. This new pair of Clarks, the Citadel Oxford, is his new favorite because it is light weight, casual, and so comfortable.	1
I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players	0
WOW.. what can't I say about these shoes... I've bought two pair in different colors & absolutely LOVE them for their comfort and snazzy, fun appearance. They're great at work and at play, and even during outings that require alot of walking. Highly recommend!!	1
This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals	0
GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.	1
For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable	0

I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!	0
"These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. 

I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.

In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today"	1
I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on.  The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible	0
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)	1
Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.

Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away	0

I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them	1

Who would ever wear this monstracity? First of all you got no color, no padding, no pazazz! This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic. It is also from a company called Jerzees and it's not a jersey? What up with that? Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave	0
This was inexpensive, attractive, excellent windbreaker. Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip. 	1
For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people	0
I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase	1
The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.	0
This item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that I purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running. Other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase	1
"These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.

I am very pleased with the soft briefcase I purchased.  It is so much easier to handle than a hard one.   I would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if I need something else	1
"These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  

I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot"	0
Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased.  The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it.  So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent, plus the product.  I have received no satisfaction	1
"I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.  

I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick"	0
These jeans are extremely soft and comfortable. Like most children's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands. My only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker. My boys are tough on their clothes	1

Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe	1
I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again.

I am very happy with this product, its comfortable and good looking. Worth buy...	1
It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information	0

I had the worst feet!  I ran my first marathon in May, and I was in a panic.  On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit!  My feet hurt so bad!  I was training on a lot of downhill runs, and therefore landed on the balls of my feet.  Ouch!  I think I would have been better off to run in nothing, than to wear what I had, which was a top of the line shoe.  I was desparate!  I found these Asics GT 2110 Men's Shoe (I'm a woman) and I felt 100% better!! I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet, what an awesome shoe!!  I finished my marathon in them, I couldn't have done it without them.	1

Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again. 	0
bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for $19.99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. Love the comfort of them, think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide & sloppy on my foot & the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes, I wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not, I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals, perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. I am a self-professed shoe addict & these are great for those days you want only comfort	1

"These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!
The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them"	1
We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you	0
Most flattering yoga pants I've ever worn.  I have an akward figure, long waist, big butt, a little pot belly, but these pants look and feel great.  Plus, I've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers.  I want 10 pairs	1
"I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me ""you walk kind of funny in those shoes"". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would ""inspect"" them. If they felt it was a ""manufacturers defect"" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too.

I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking	0

:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.	0
I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband, he LOVES it.  It's comfortable, fits well and looks new after multiple washings.  Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon.com.  I ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn't the watch that I ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising.  To top it off their customer service was not good, when I called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated, the products were all GREAT and the service was great!	1
You'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult. Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me	0
"These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2"" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!"	1
"accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side.  all my other zippered garments come that way.  this turfer men's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward.  would not buy again for that reason. 

this shell is otherwise nicely made"	0
This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon	1
"One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...

I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally. 	0
This was a Christmas gift for my friend's husband. He really liked it and said it was excellent quality	1
I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.	0
I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps. They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day, even when I have just gotten it done, and keep my ears toasty warm.  Great product and worth the money. My daughter is equally impressed.	1
"I bought two of these, hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event, and quickly returned them.   Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term ""charmeuse"", and are thin and gauzy.   They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz, much of that must have been the packaging.  A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction"	0
These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly	1
"I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).

At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.

Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere"	0
"they were slightly small and a tad too stiff.

but very cut"	1
"The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 

There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection."	0
My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too	1
The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again	0
after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it.	1
These are paper thin cotton and feel rough.  They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate!  A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan	0
I was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats	1
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN!	0
"The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing.
Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers.
Haagar has done a terrific job again"	1
This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each	0
"I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.

About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.

I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others"	1
I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment & they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one	0
I have a wide, relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit.  Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me, so I have been loyal for the last decade.  I can't find them in my area, so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them	1
I really wanted to like these, but they just won't stay put.  It's not a thong, but it will be after a few hours of wear.  I usually love DKNY products, so I am disappointed	0
You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too	1
The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was.  My son exchanged it	0
When I bought these shoes I didn't know they would look so pretty. I am glad I bought these shoes	1
I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite	0

"I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.

Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good.."	0
This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.	1
Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all	0
i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home, tried them on, and i was absolutely amazed. They are a bit of a low rise, but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to, and once you find the perfect fit, you can hardly even feel that it's there. I give it a perfect score, and i am definatley going to buy more of these	1

This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product .

I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs.

"the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money.

the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set.
the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did, so it was sent FAST.

"I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and ""A"" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32"" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are ""painfully small"" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.
By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing"	0
I love these shoes...in fact I ordered another pair in black.  They are very comfortable and look cute.  Hey...can't beat that	1
"""Sling"" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think ""tourniquet"" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the ""sling"" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Big time"	0
"I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices.

For the price, this is a good buy"	1
"The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's ""profile"" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about ""low-rise""--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN� briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear"	0
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine	1
I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.	0

These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks.  No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up.

My baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old.  I ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months.

Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!

"This is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not ""TSA"" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.

I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.	1
This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund	0
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper	1
"I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However,
when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been 
$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.
Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.

These shoes were not put together very well. The bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second I put them on. If I had the choice to buy this breand again I would not. These shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all. I am very disappionted	0
The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase	1
This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all. 	0
my fav shoes- I can wear them to dress up or to dress down... the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to	1
The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase	0

Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now	1

I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots	1

I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt.

"This workout is short but you will feel ""worked out"" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.  Definitely ""shocked"" the muscles"	1

"As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.
 
Once we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.
 
Tina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.
 
Beginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.
 
I have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. 
 
Overall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper"	1

"This is a VERY sexy pair of underwear. Guys: if you're new to the thong/g-string scene, this is a good place to start. I recommend g-strings because there's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs.

Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much	1
You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.	0
The product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product	1
I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available.  As far as appearance, it is well crafted.  When it comes to functinality, it stinks.  Here are the problems I have with it:  1) there is no hole for the microphone,  2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.  This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.  This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player	0

They are awesome, only tricky part is making sure you get the right size, my husband and I love them	1
I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry	0

As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child	1

I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this. 	0

Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way	0

This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.	0

I really love the way these shoes look.  I am really picky about shoes I buy.  I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that.

have spent years looking for a bra that feels good, does what it's supposed to and didn't make you wish you could get home & slip out of something so uncomfortable... at last i think i'm at the end of my search.  very comfortable, great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies.  only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps	1

I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you	1

I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice	0

"In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed .

I'm a big ""shoe collector"" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking .

These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.

"I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that ""you get what you pay for,"" but this was a piece of garbage.

This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the ""raw edges"" are now listed as a ""feature.""  Ahem.

In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): ""quality is a subjective issue.""  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.

This product is fine, however it was much too baggy.  I'm not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with the short, but I just wish I had bought a smaller size.  Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product. 	1
Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.	0
I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise).

The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The ""backpack straps"" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!

These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl.

"I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.

"Amazon notes that these socks are ""only made from the finest yarns."" They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. 

The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!

I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will ""bunch up"" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.

Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0
"I ordered these robes (in white and ivory) as Christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law.  They arrived quickly and beautifully packaged.  

Last week, I was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa.  I was concerned about the one size fits all sizing, but I was told that she loved the extra coverage (she's probably a size 14-16) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline (I buy him XL sweaters).  

I will order one for myself as soon as I am in the market for a robe. "	1

"The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the ""just out of the shower chills"" that you get. It doesnt quite have the ""luxurious"" feel of a spa robe, and the thread loops are matted in certain areas, but quality wise it is better than anything else I've seen for similar prices. The length is much shorter than pictured. I bought this for my boyfriend, who is 6 ft, 190 lbs, average build, and it comes just above his knee! All in all, it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it."	1
This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic	0

"The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended."	0

"Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. 

After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.

The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves

The outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. 

Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.

The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.

Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside."	1

Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated.

My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return	0
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine	1
The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant.

You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.	0

I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!	1
"Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

"These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color.  They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.
But, as a general rule when buying Italian clothing, *always* buy them bigger than you would expect.  I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7"" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too ""huggy"" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more ""delicate"" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.  I *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath, feeling the soft cashmere on your arms.  "	1

Unfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails.

We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond.  We will never order anything through Amazon again"	1

I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.

I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe	0

I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite	1
I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 	0

I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS.

"Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

When the shoes arrived here, they were huge.

I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a ""buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly"" promotion and Amazon prime, so my ""refund"" would be less than nothing.

"I hate long socks and smelly shoes so I've become a big fan of shoe liners.  I recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them.  They are each individually priced at $5.99.  So for 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail.  So this is a good deal at $4/pair.

More importantly, they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam.  They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet.  They are cut generously -- My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big, but manageable.  If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L.  They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.

"Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say ""Hey, let me pay for this,"" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps"	0

"My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size.
If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a better
fit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews.

PROS:
This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!
It's an easy to put on short boot. 
(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)
The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.  
Stains will wipe right off.
I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young
professionals to wear with their slacks.
Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.

CONS:
Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.
I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.  
The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.
The zipper is not the best quality.

Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!

"I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO"	0
"I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding ""it all"" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet"	1
"I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..

TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.

This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...

"I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things. 
I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits. 
I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say ""wow this feels great"" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the ""different"" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point"	1
I returned this bra to exchange for size the day after I received it in October.  It is now January and I have not yet received the replacement.  I have called several times but to no avail!  I can't give a good review of this product because I haven't actually gotten to wear the bra	0
Spectacular item.  Wears well on a fine woman.  My wife is short, and this item fit fine, especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall	1
Buying this was a mistake. This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt. The straps are not comfortable, it's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded.

I'm so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn't work out.

These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.	0
These shoes exceeded my expectations, in that they are very lightweight.  The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber.  Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber, but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned.   They look good, they are very comfortable--very little, if any, break-in time.  If you like the look, it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel	1
I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely	0
"So far I have been very satisfied with this bag. For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use. 

I'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last. 

I use it to hold 2 1"" notebooks, a textbook, a portfolio, a book, a calculator and my pda. This is about maximum capacity. I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections.

The handle ontop is cozy, the over the shoulder strap should be wider.

"It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.

I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.

I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It ""flows"" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel ""rich""!

Overall, I like it"	1
I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic	0

I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long.

I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!	0
The overall quality of the garment is excellent.  The fabric is of very good quality, as is the stitching.  The sizing is also accurate.  However, the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered, but a substitute!  Thus, four stars, not 5.  In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable	1

After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.	0
My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots.  I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them.  I don't know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas.  I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes, yet!  Overall, I think the socks are great. 	1

I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses.

I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere	0
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking	1
"I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.

Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.

This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.

"Was shopping at the mall.  This item caught my husband's eye in the window.  We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses.  We actually bought one for ourselves.  It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home).  Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight.  I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't.

We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages.  It's a two-man operation.  My husband would lift the luggage/bag, then I would look at the scale quickly"	1
"I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a ""specialist"" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN""T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE ""OLD"" VERSION.

I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today. It was on sale for $49.99. Needless to say, I bought it right away at Amazon since it was $39.99! It fit me really well, I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened, it was comfortable all around. I really like the mesh material at the toe area. I'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months! This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day. It's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe.	1

"We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for ""bib goodies"" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)"	1
I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.	0

This bra is great for those of us with smaller busts.  It's the only bra I'll wear under my t-shirts now because it doesn't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra I've found.

I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one.  It is awesome.  The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn't way too tight or super big.

I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on.

Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one	0

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn"	0

"The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb ""was""?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash. "	0
"Best sock in performance that I have ever tried.  I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed.  No sagging, no defects.  The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.

One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again.  If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.

"I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.

The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear."	0
This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!	1
I got this because I thought it was a good deal, but the clothes weren't very cute and weren't good quality.  I gave them all away, I don't recommend	0
This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt.  It is unlined, has a bit of stretch for comfort, and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts. I think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter, and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt. It was almost thirteen dollars then, but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal	1
I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products. 	0
I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong. I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site, at home, out on the town, etc. These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag	1
I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful.  The Lalita is very uncomfortable.  They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub.  I was truly disappointed	0
These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either	1

My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great	1
This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them.

I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.	1
"I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks ""repaired"" so they never really wear out.

**Black version has large ""Betula"" on side in white"	0
The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price.  Very satisfied	1
Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.	0
I where these shoes all the time. They are really comfortable to run in	1
I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0
I like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean, although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean. I have a high arch and they seem to support well so I would say over all they were a good choice	1
I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper	0
Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox	1
"I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not ""wick away moisture.""  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors."	0
"I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.  

My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them.  I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.  

The size is perfect, color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.  

I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.

"First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.

Backpack is light when empty, yet strong to curry the load of books to school. Side pocket for bottle very handy. Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys, very helpful and practical. I like the base of the backpack being dark color so  it doesn't look dirty from use	1

In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit).

"This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in ""hand"" is worth the added function of ""wicking"" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it."	1
I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition	0

"Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.

Comfy, tough, lightweight, wrinkly (like me). Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. Good stitching. Velcro� back pockets will save your wallet!

"The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.

Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.

A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.

I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph"	0
"So glad I didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards.

These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are	0

These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.	0
I just don't know where to start.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to describe the comfort.  You will just have to try them on to believe it.  My neighbor, mother, husband and I all swear by this product.  Accept no substitutions.   Attractive...no, but the comfort will blow you away	1

Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before.

I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy	1
"I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its ""functionality"" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being ""propelled through every foot"", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible"	0
I read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big. So I always wear a eight and I ordered a 9. They were huge on me. I sold them to a friend. also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot. I'll stick to my Ugg's	1
These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0
Please note, I did not find the need to order up many sizes.  I only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  Nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction, nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back.  I loves these boots and at a great price too.  Fast efficent shipping as well.  I should say that I bought a pair of White Mountain Suede Shearling boots and I was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality	1

"I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying ""Dopp"" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.

Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet."	1

I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.

"I really liked my tote bag.  What I liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that I use mine to tote my books in college.

I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly.

At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0

"I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me.  Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes.  It fits me very well, looks great, and is comfortable.  The color, Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. I do recommend the shoe, and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet	1
The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off. 	0
"Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, ""Be the first person to write a review""  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?  

Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.

I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!

These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. 

Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a ""ten tippy toes"" rating for how well they performed in the test."	1
Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper. 	0
This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes.  It's light weight and flexilble, but still supportive. Well worth $30.	1

I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices	0

"After having purchased the DLO sports case for my Creative Zen Vision M, I read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight, scratching the unit, and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player. I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. 

The case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. 

The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product. Highly recommended"	1

Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that.  I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks, nike etc, I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back !!! Its like walking with slippers on. I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down. Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!!  I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe. Buy them you wont be sorry !! Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !	1
saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, A&F, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..	0
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy	1
"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. "	0

Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.

"I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat"	0

"This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say ""Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains"". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.
After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6"" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review"	0
This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed. 	1

Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!

"I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large ""snags"" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr"	0
I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and give great support. These are my second pair. The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that. Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that	1
I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money	0
I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate, which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches. Asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which I love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints,until I found these shoes. I absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again. This is the only type of shoe I will ever buy and has been the only one I have bought  for 7 years now ! I highly recommend this shoe! Especially if your feet tend to overpronate	1
"These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2"" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.

The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that"	0
My baby loves his new kicks!! They came quick and would recomend them to anyone	1
I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received	0
My husband is a big man and very rough on belts.  Most belts last him a few weeks.  This one has lasted him 3+ years.  The only reason I'm buying him a new one is because he's lost so much weight.  There's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt I'm replacing.  Definitely got our money's worth out of it	1
These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again	0
Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles	1
"  These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an ""overstich"" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.  
  They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes"	0
The boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside.  These boots will never disappoint...they are fun, warm, comfy and stylish!  Dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out	1
Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking & the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far.	0
I bought these just a couple of months ago but i've already put them to the test. I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico, I ended up covered in mud, my new shoes included. I was worried they would be spoiled (it really was a lot of mud). Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone. Besides being really comfortable, it's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job.	1
I never receive this ITEM, i want may money back or replace my order	0
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.	1
The sleeves are long and the shirt is short. I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes.... Wont look to good with low rise jeans! At least not with my average body. I dont weight 95 pounds	0
Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.	1
These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots	0
"For me, they are very difficult to put on.  I have to use a long shoe horn. They aren't tight, in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm. They look great if you like the UGG look.  I'm hoping when they loosen up, they will be easier to put on.  The top scrunches down when I put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on. It could be me though!Otherwise, I love everything else about them.

This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders	0
This was a very nice item.  I bought it for my mom for christmas.  She loved it.  It was shipped very fast and I was informed very well on shipment information.  This shoe was a great deal.  Usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal.  Thanks!	1
"I purchased what I thought were ""deals"" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed. 

To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.

I hope this advice helps"	0
Very comfortable, but the straps keep coming loose. 	1
and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas	0
My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter.	1
I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all	0
These are perfect for low-rise pants. The cut will likely be flattering for any guy. The front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability, and I find the fit in the back to be basically great. An essential for those whose jeans hang low	1
I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me. 	0
"The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now. 

My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin, not Zen screen. So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen. The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen, but that part only tells the time anyway"	1
I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	0
Excellent product. Item arrived fast and exactly as described. Works like a charm. Haven't yet had TSA open the lock, but it does the job	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
"Once my best friend described my bra size as ""beige.""  Meaning that when you shop in the ""full figure"" section of a department store, you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.

If this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bra for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.  The cups do the supporting, so the bra doesn't need to have those super-wide, heavily padded straps.  And it gives a good silhouette under clothes, but will also look nice by itself"	1
This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable.  The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material. 	0
What can I say, these are pretty and practical. I know my boyfriend is going to be impressed, after the shock wears off. I like these panties, I like the lacy look, so divine, and I like the way they ride pretty low. And they don't show through your clothes. Like my dear gal pal Ophella, I can imagine a naughty situation or two where I could have a little illicit and harmless fun. Yikes! What am I saying	1
"This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the ""sweater"" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious ""Z"" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase."	0
Who hasn't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl? So glamorous, girly, and sexy. I was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot. They really do feel like slippers, just with the heel as a bonus. I normally wear a 6W or a 6 �, so these are a little snug, but not too bad. So glad I bought them- two pairs red & black. Pink will be next..	1
"They are warm and comfortable while they last.


All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.


It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months"	0
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour	1
I bought these based on a previous review. After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart. Maybe the quality control person was out that day??? I returned them and got a full refund	0
"Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:

1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.
2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.
3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).


Now there are a few things that may give you pause.

1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.
2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is ""substantial"", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.

This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again"	1
Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot. 	0
Excellent quality for the price I paid.  Very happy with purchase. Arrived in a timely manner	1
These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable. 	0
"My husband really likes the Intimo Men's Classic Silk Pants.  They are very comfortable, and the color is really nice.  He wears them almost every day!

This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)	1
I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.	0
"I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.  

I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, ""Opaque Tapestry,"" maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra"	1

I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else	1
"Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4"" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help"	0
I  just love the color and the way it looked on me . IT  is a very very pretty jacket 	1
I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas.  I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach.  I am really disappointed with the size.  It's pretty deep, but not very wide at all.  No way I'll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag.  Still, I'll be able to use it for other things	0
"...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more...

THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM	0
This company gave me very good service. They called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct. I was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color isn't large but that is okay. They were out of Granny Apple and so we had to get Red	1
I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time.	0
Very comfortable.  Better quality than most.  Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside.  Sizing appears to right on for me.  I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right.  The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe.  I doubt they will last very long outside, but who wears slippers to the store??  Highly recommended! 	1
I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again.	0
Good construction and material for the price.  Size seems a bit different in L vs. R unless I am more asymmetrical now than I noticed before?  Nice sheepskin material.  I am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc I purchased by Acorn	1
Even though I favor leather, every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate. Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling. The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots, I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas	0
"Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 

I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals."	1

"Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players, well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads, but it didn't stop me from being active later in life.  With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways.

So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more"	1

I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot"	0
I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish. I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms, but they are very expensive. This is lightweight, made of cotton, so very easy to clean. I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. I am very satisfied with my purchase	1
I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.   It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk	0
I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:	1
Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.	0

"Beware, the size is not true size fit
My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands.

everything doesnt holds in places, it doesnt look like the photo at all.
the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid.
Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy, and if you are a medium, you need a SMALL for this dress, and it will still fit loosly on you. that's how big of a dress this is.

These sweaters are a fantastic value for $18.  Quality is excellent, though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes.  Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters	1
size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled	0
I was pleased with all purchase.  I did not feel that I was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer.  In addition for reasons that are not clear to me, I continue to get duplicate orders, or the order is sent to an old address.  The return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul	1
I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute.  Other than that they were quite unusable.  I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard.  Had to get rid of them	0
The Disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson.  He loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides.  They are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides, but they were a big hit for him.	1
I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit.  I even complimented her on them.  I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon).  I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them.  Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving.  Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic.  I was disappointed.  If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..	0
Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one. I ordered on-line, and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon, verifying that the size I ordered was correct.  The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.  She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size.  I love all the pockets.  It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable.  And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. The outer shell is also very soft.  	1
"These shoes are not as cute as they appear, the heel is really 2.5"", the material is cheap, the fit is too wide, the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in, etc. etc. etc.

On a positive note, it's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress. 

Be warned, the company claims that all their shoes have 2"" heels when they don't and they charge tax on shipping charges.."	0
I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.	1
"The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  

The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered"	0

They can be a little stiff at times, but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing, you will love them like no other"	1
the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc	0
Well, since I will be using this soon, I believe it will be just perfect. Holds all the necessary items safely, so will let you know when I return from my trip	1
"Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my 
circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also, 
the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and 
your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.  

If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.  
It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear
under their helmets"	0
Material was not overly thick and designs were great! Look good on my daughter	1
I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale.  But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be.  In addition, the fabric is bad.  There are tores in all of the edges	0
At first I thought i wouldn't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on. However, this is the most comfortable bra I bought, and I bought a lot of different kinds. This is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort	1
"This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.

A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses"	0
"I'll start with my stats: I'm a size 8, 5'2"", and I carry my weight in my rear and thighs (all extra 20 pounds of it). This skirt is lovely, it hides what should never be seen (refer to the 20 pounds above...) and helps create a slimming line. I've worn it with silk blouses, stockings, and high heels and I've worn it with slouchy sweaters, tights, and chunky mary janes -- it works perfectly with both"	1
This bra has an akward fit.  I had to return it.  A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret	0
I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower.  I've looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more.  These socks stay on my little boy's feet and are made very well	1
"I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting.  By the end of my fitting, my feet were throbbing, red, and pinched.  Literally, my pinky toe was purple.  

I bought my true size, but I still don't think these shoes would've been wearable even with a size larger.  They must just be REALLY narrow"	0
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old	1
The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00	0
"I love my Clarks and I can get such good prices through Amazon.  I have
bought two pairs of Clarks with Amazon and I plan on buying more in
the future.  Bett"	1
Cute designs but they shrink.  I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up. 	0
The product was as advertised and delivered on time	1
I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone	0
"These are great shoes! The shoes are a medium-to-baby pink and they're very ""high style"". The shoes run true to size.  The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and I got lots of raves when I wore them to a recent wedding.  They're great shoes at a good price"	1
Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame.... 	0
"I ordered these shoes for my wedding, so you can imagine my nervousness.  I received them within a week and fell in love!  I've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves!  Even at the shoe repair where I had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where I had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes!  
Order a 1/2 size smaller"	1
Need to use a belt definitively. Does not look like the picture. If you do not use a belt, you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top. 	0
The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!	1
The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift	0
This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available.  Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don't work well.  This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet, only reduced to 4x3 inches.  Holds three cards, bills, and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards.  Great buy	1
"These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the ""ruggedness"" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them"	0
These are so pleasing on the eye. What can I say besides the fact that these jeans fit great, look great, and attract alot of attention. Buy them!!	1
This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!!	0
There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they're good for mountian hikers. The keep your feet warm and dry	1
These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice.	0
I love this Guess oval tag necklace.  It is just like the Tiffany's oval tag necklace, and it has an adorable little rhinestone dangle.  The best part is the price.  I only had to spend $18.00 for it, and there is also a matching bracelet for only $15.00!  I would recommend this to anyone of any age	1
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)	0
My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer.	1
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended	0
"The whole Rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand.  do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands.  When it was all for charities before-thats okay.  but it is ridiculous now.  heres the rules:

-Livestrong= okay because that was the original 
-Everything else= NO.  
-People who wear like 5 of them= Probably the main reason why you'd starting wearing the regular ones.  

Plus they're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost .2 cents to make.

i love the colts, but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large, it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen. the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight. i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward	0

I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters	1
After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe	0
"Sharp set of shoes.  Comfortable, too, and they fit well.

But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella's Coach - while the mice were still mice.  It took FOREVER to arrive, so be warned"	1
The stockings were not in the package, and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place. My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call. I will not do business with this company again	0
Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic	1
This product worked well in holding up a strapless bra, but after a few hours, my skin developed a blister underneath the tape. I would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters, so use this product with caution	0
I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly	1
Horrible. Must go through hell to return it too, they won't give you back the shipping to send it to you, just the cost of the item. Do not buy. Do not recommend	0
My husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time, he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough.  Since the Red Sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular Reebok slippers I thought it was win-win all around so I bought them as part of his Valentine's gifts.  Needless to say, they were a big hit, he LOVES them!  They are comfortable, modern looking and the Red Soz logo made his day.  I would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them	1

I bought these for my husband, and he loves them.  The material is soft and comfortable, and they keep his feet warm.  They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers.  He wears 11 1/2 wide, so I got him the XL pair, and they fit him well	1
"Order placed by 7th of July didn't arrived by now.

"The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... ""Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos."" Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet"	1
"I could not believe the quality in these shoes...HORRIBLE!
The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper. They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable. I bought chinese shoes in china town for $2, they were wonderfully comfortable, still smelled funny, but they were awesome.these are not!"	0

Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product.  I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging	0

My girlfriend thinks they're sexy and they're solid underwear.  No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs.  If you're a briefs guys (I switch around), these are the way to go	1
"I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies!

On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future"	0
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff	1
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this	0
This is, by far, the most comfortable pair of unders I've ever worn. Over the years, I've gone with boxers and with briefs, and in the boxers vs. briefs contest, both are losers compared to the Contour Thong. There's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. The Contour Thong has a Y thong back, and you don't need to have the body of an International Male/Undergear model to wear these. For any guy with an open mind, I recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try	1
The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands	0
I am very happy with the swimsuit.  Delivery was as stated.  Fits wonderfully.  The only problem was once I was wearing it, a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing, but I tucked it in whenever it was noticeable.  I was very happy that the suit fit nicely because I was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping.  The size I ordered was the size I normally wear and as I said, it fit great	1
We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product	0
great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time.	1
When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one	0
"This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.

I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long	0
The New Balance 991 GL (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support, wear well and are well ventilated. The 991 GL carries on that tradition. Hopefully, the 992 will be just as good	1
"You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. ""You get what you pay for"" applies to this product"	0
I am not a runner; thus, I use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping, errands, hanging out, etc.  I have owned many shoes over the years, and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I am hooked on the New Balance line of running shoes.   	1
These socks were thin, large, and horrible.  They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently.  Absolutely worthless	0
"Pros
They don't hurt the back of your heels
Comfortable like walking with socks on
Cons
Very thin,you can see your toes thru the fabric on the top.
Bottom line, they are a good buy for the price.  Very cute, stylish, and comfortable"	1
I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator. Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder.	0
I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. My husband loved the way I looked in it. I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy...and also because I tend to be between sizes. But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. I am very pleased with this seller. The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..	1
Illuminator is shown in ad, but a generic brand was shipped to me.  The light wasn't as bright and it wasn't made very well.The crank was cheaply made, and the button that you press didn't work every time. 	0
"This shoe is great. It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort. I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet. 
It was a great deal that I just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price :"	1
I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price	0
The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.	1
This product was disappointing.  Not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected.  I guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit	0

Oh my gosh!  I was so excited to see this item.  My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance!  I will be a hit on Valentine's Day with this gift!	1

I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	1
I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you	0
My husband, the Star Wars fanatic, loves them!  Very comfy	1
Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience	0
"I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing. The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees. 
This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!"	1
This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.  I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper. 	0

I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY 	0
This is a really soft, and very comfortable pillow.  It is priced great, a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows.  I am very satisfied	1
This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through	0
I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes.  I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable.  Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too!  The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again).  The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy.  I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes	1
"When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped. 

The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.

The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.

Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while."	0

"When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.

"I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the ""delicate"" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's"	0
These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected	1
This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up	0
"This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers.  The last ones stayed with me for three years.  They are so good, I stopped using the ""big, home set"" and use these type daily.   Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long.

Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl.   Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl"	1

"I purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet.  I have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain.

These boots fit very well, look great, and I can wear them longer than any shoe I have had in the past year!!  I love them"	1
For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue.  Very dark.  Also, the sizes run big.  Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned	0
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and look good. The price is a bit steep, I think, but considering I could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them, I guess they are worth it. Definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown!	1
"Although very cute, Crocs are not good shoes.  They are a cheap, plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all.  I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are ""non slip"".  She did slip in them, many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet.  They are the right size but I just think they are not made well.

Don't go for the hype. They are a useless shoe."	0
"I ordered 3 products from Dance Now...None of them fit being at least one size too small. When I contacted Dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for Women. Men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size. I found no reference to that detail on the Amazon website. Dance Now representative told me it is referenced on their own website. But Amazon does not make that fact known.

So now I have 2 orders I have to pay shipping to Dance Now as well as their exhchange cost. I am a bit unhappy over this"	1
"first of all, they dont even go up TO the thigh!  they attempt to sit right above the knee!!

These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG! I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. BEWARE	1

I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They're well made and super comfortable. He liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color. Highly recommended	1
Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes	0
I bought these for my son, and he says they are really comfortable; he wears them when he plays basketball--lots of support and no blisters.  I'll most likely buy another pair for him..	1
My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket. 	0
I love this bra!  It is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said, adds a whole cup size!  Cheaper than Victoria's Secret and well made	1
Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit	0
"BEWARE:  This bra WILL increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more!  The only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something's up.

This bra is made from good materials.  The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy.  The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that. 

The only problem I have, is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup!  I prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a ""push-up"" design.

Otherwise, it's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results"	1
I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.	0
"these shoes are so cute and sexy! High heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner!

"I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and ""break them in"" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years"	0
These socks are absolutely the best. I take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat. (Not good in the middle of a side plank!)Anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry. One note; make sure not to order them big, the idea is that they should be snug	1
First of all they didn't sent me the pictured panties, but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print. Butt-ugly. Second, they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse. Returned right away. Very disappointing	0
"I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way. 

I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable. 

Oh well.  The ""concept"" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job"	1

So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again	0
I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on	1

Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing	0
I just recieved my shoes today and can't believe that these shoes fit perfectly. The wide size 8.5 is just what I needed. I am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as I would often have with other shoes. I love the value as I purchased these for only $19.79. 	1
"We have not opened the package. The item is advertised as one size. Without a notice that the one size is not ""One Size fits all"" It is XL (Grand Plus for those that speak french). My wife wears a size 2 or 4. Obviously this was a waste of money"	0
The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.	1

"I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.
I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again"	0
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service	1
I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH	0
It's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes.  The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins, so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured.  However, for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart. 	1

On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited.

"I bought this for my wife as a ""throw in"" with more expensive items because it was so cheap.I actualy forgot I even ordered it until it came in. I was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me. Unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture. She is a size small and it fit perfect. This not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me. The only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up"	1
OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow	0
This is an amazing product. I bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature. believe me, there is no comparison. not only is the Halo product made better, and is more durable and holds the baby better, but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too. I trust this company because the product is recommended by the SIDS society. I don't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle, because he is so secure in it.	1

Just got them in the mail today. As other kenneth cole reaction shoes, it runs one size larger. I'm usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right. These boots look great with jeans. The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph.	1

These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though	0

these are so great, and keep my baby's feet warm.  She even slept with them on with no problem.  She's been a master at getting her socks off up until now.  They also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails.  She's chewing on the toes but I haven't seen any scuff marks yet, so they are holding up very well	1
Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit. 	0
robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2	1
"Not comfortable.  The ""thong"" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable"	0
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.	1

"The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  

Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety"	0

I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991	0
I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security	1
I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2  	0
"Pros:
Ultra Fast delivery w/package tracking. Item was shipped within a few hours of order. Suit is in great condition and I like the color.
Cons:
When they say grab bag...that means the suit may or may not look like the picture. Mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer...which is cool with me cause I actually wanted a blue jammer. Just be prepared"	1
I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe	0
Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price	1

this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought, my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it's SUPER tight on her.... this was very disappointing to say the least.... if you normally wear a small in other things, I would suggest you buy the extra large in this. The quality of the material is GREAT that's what made me even give this product a 2..	0

"I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  

I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all"	0

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!	0
"well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play.

But they are worth every single penny i spent on them.

I LOVE my soft and comfortable green robe that I received last year for Mother's Day! Whenever I wear it, I want to just relax with a magazine or watch TV, and then fall asleep in it.

"While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're ""out of style"", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging"	0
"I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual ""crowding"" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to ""improve"" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)  
I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else."	1
"OUT OF STYLE!

All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans. They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style.

This is the absolute best sport bra made. I have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once I discovered this particular model I have never switched back.

These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.  	0

This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap.  When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off.  When I emailed Alys's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this bra	0
"I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.

I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.

My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter). 

Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)"	1
I really wanted this product to work, but it really didn't help with my problem. I always have erect nipples no matter what and this really doesn't fully flatten them, or make them less noticeable with t-shirts, etc	0
We bought this for our 13 month old for Christmas and she loves it. It is extremely soft. Her favorite part is the cell phone that rings. The compact also squeaks. I love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it. This is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl	1
I was so disappointed in these. I am full-busted (38DD) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time.  I used a band-aid and it did a better job.  These provided no help at all. AND they REALLY HURT taking them off	0
These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.	1
These didn't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much. They do have great adhesive. Also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola, because they are pretty small. I used every pair, just thinking I was putting them on poorly, but everytime, I was a pokin	0
"These shoes are durable, comfortable, and most importantly come in different widths.  Most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but D width.  New Balance does.

For those of you complaining about width, my guess is that if you size your feet correctly, that problem will go away.  I had always worn a 12D width, until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life I found out I need a 13B. You may think you know your feet, but you may not.

As to comfort, I can't complain.  As to durability, maybe they are a little stiffer, but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others, that is well worth it in my book"	1
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
This is a fabulous find! My husband loves henley shirts...but, they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length. After many failed attempts, I finally found the perfect shirt. Great look, great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too	1
I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again	0
Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .Do reccomend	1
"it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces. 
look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good"	0
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets	1
I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again. 	0
"The zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue . It is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence, etc. slipping out, making identity  theft a serious possibilty.

 The zipper wallet avoids this from happening. Ironicly, this item is not available at local stores.I encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday world

I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!?	0
I bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them!  They fit great, they arrived in great condition and very quickly.  The rhinestones are really blingy in the sun!  I am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also.  Very cute for the price	1
I was givin this case for christmas and I thought it was great for the first month...................then I took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen.  I am a total scratch freak but still I was really mad.  WARNING: if YOU don't like your iPod scratched DO NOT get this case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone	1
"I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.  

If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!"	0
I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son. We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole, but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction. They are excellent shoes and he loves them. He won't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments	1
the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.	0
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!	1
I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock	0
"These shoes are stunning, original and over-the-top beautiful. I just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? Square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything, but ""mosquito hunters"". They have a perfect narrow shape, with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000. Trust me, with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front. I'm picking up the black ones as I'm writing this. Enjoy them....I know you as well as your better half will!"	1
These were not as expected, there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels, there was just an open hole. He has problems using these too!	0
"Good color visibility; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan North.
The hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again. 
I have ordered Maroon but will likely add some other color choice, as the array is rather impressive. For an 100 % acrylic knit, this is not a bad hat; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily, almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine."	1
This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again	0
They shipped these almost overnight. My daughter was a perfect little flower girl; No trips, no blisters, and they've held up great over the past 9-10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play. She was a size 10 at the time of the wedding, but the shoes were a 9? Her feet were fine. She can still squeeze into them now, and she's an 11. Very pleased. Good value. These are the exact shoes	1
The jacket we received had weird arms, they had a hole for the thumb, and then another for the rest of the fingers. Great for skiing or snowboarding, but for casual use in Florida winter wasn't very practical. Columbia in general is a company I swear by	0
Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..	1
I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.  I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle	0
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it	1
I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut	0
"The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material. However, I ordered the extra large, and they were very small for that size.  It seemed as though the XL was more a Med/Large.  I would also think that ""lounge pants"" or ""PJ bottoms"" would be a bit bigger as you wouldn't want these types of pants too tight.  They were a gift, so I just hope they don't shrink after washing! "	1
The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors. 	0
"These are the best windproof liner gloves out there.  I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said ""made with Gore Windstopper"" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. 

These are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  

The only ""downside"" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. 

I wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens. 

These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years. 

I can't recommend these enough.  

-Scott"	1
"These gloves should really be called ""Simulation Leather"". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize"	0
This is such a wonderful pair of gloves. They are light and easily portable. They can be folded and stored in one's pockets. They have features that enable use of one's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs. The synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather (especially wind and rain). I am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone's elses	1
"As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11"" by 8.5"" by 6.5"", the one I've got is surely not that big (10""x8""x4"" at best!), and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it (and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise, was it what they were aiming for?). The material is ok, so is the craftsmanship, but the fact that they  lied (yes! l-i-e-d!) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal. A great dissapointment!!! :"	0
These are hot, Hot, HOT!  Will be buying them in other colors.  My guy went NUTS	1
i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped	0
  The product is in good condition when it was shipped. The quality is good. Thank you.	1
i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips!	0
I bought these for my husband.  He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm.  He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself !	1
I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?	0
"I purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift... And I wish I would have purchased one for myself as well! This robe is made of the softest, warmest materials, but is extremely light-weight, unlike most robes. ""Luxurious"" is the perfect adjective."	1
"The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a ""T"" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody"	0
These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too	1
"I love Vanity Fair. Their bras just fit me perfectly. When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair. Not only that, but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material. I tried it on in hopes it may fit. It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on. Not because of size. It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, ""Made in Hong Kong."	0
"I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.  

Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable"	1
The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order.  Amazon had said they would rectify the error, although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle, and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties, and a different strap entirely	0
"Most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers, or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies.

This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today.  It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.

My first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.

If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color"	1
"First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 ""runs"" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product"	0
the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got, after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80's Purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge. i was blown away	1
The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad	0
"This was just what I was looking for and couldn't find in local
retail stores.  Fits perfectly in my wallet and now my credit
cards don't fall on the ground in stores!  Reasonable price also.
Excellent product"	1
I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.	0
"I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no ""break in"" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven"	1
I was disappointed with the shoes when I received them.  On the website, the shoes looked Gold in color and were described as Gold, but when I received the shoes they were beige.  I am sorry to say that I could not wear the shoes.  	0
.....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that	1
These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans	0
This merchant really delivers with this item - In the stores, this is almost twice the price.  I really wasn't expecting such quality from this item (Yes, it's Crushed Velvet, so not warm, but warm wasn't the goal). Would definitely recommend this item, and may buy another color for myself	1
"I got two problems with this here lingeree:
1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label ""Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear.""
2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend.."	0
At first I had my heart set on a different cloak, but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one. I am very pleased that I was not disappointed. This cloak looks and feels beautiful. It has a nice button closure at the neck, and for those that are petite it is floor length. This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume. It is very comfortable and soft, no itchy feel here	1
My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit	0
I bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them... however I recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of Mt. Everest, ouch	1
I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!! The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places. I mean, the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies! I even bought them a size larger, because some brands tend to fit a little snug	0
"This item arrived on time and the quality was great. This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for ""baby"" - it's just how I expected it would be"	1
i ordered this product from general_discounters and I have tried for 4 wks. and still I have not gotten a response from them and I havent received my order. As far as the actual cologne, it is nice but order it from that company and you'll not get to smell it because you wont get it. All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller	0
I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.	1
"I am not happy with what I got in the mail today. I thought I was getting a real used fencing foil. Instead, I got a kids plastic fencing sword!

Why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil"	0
This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first	1
"I bought this item because it said ""optional belt clip.""  The belt clip is only ""optional"" if you ""opt"" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot ""opt"" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip ""optional.""  I would call it ""will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it,"" which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in"	0
This belt is seriously great.  I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later, exactly as the seller described.  I'm not sure what the previous review was all about, but my belt is great.  I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it	1
I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads. 	0
"These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought ""thongs are not for ""real men"" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong"	1
I ordered 5 of these belt buckles. The company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they didn't actually have this belt. I needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it wasn't in stock I could have ordered it elsewhere	0
I Just want to make something clear...the windbreaker is NOT Prada, the tag reads MIU MIU, a very good brand, but definetely not Prada.  I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket.  I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect... 	1
These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.	0
Got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe.  She loves it - nice & warm, pretty pink color.  They run small-she usually takes a medium -got her a large.  She could have used an XL.  Sleeves are a bit short.  She likes the look & the zip front	1
I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable.  Other than that they are OK, but because of this I mostly wear these inside out	0
These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!	1
Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs.  The Elance is poorly made and designed, Jockey is barely evern trying.  Look on the web guys, there are better choices.... Jockey's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame	0
I have been searching for the perfect ped sock, not too thick, not so thin it slides off your heel and, most importantly, COTTON.  My search is over.  This is by far the best sock ever.  Great with sneakers AND closed in shoes.	1
I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..	0
Yes beautiful people I too own this shoe and it is fun and sexy.  I didn't think at my age I could wear such a high wedge heel however, I was wrong and thankful to be so.  This is a fun shoe which looks great on.  I have it in the gold and I love wearing them out and about	1
Like a permanent wedgie, these kept riding up my crack.  I don't recommend these at all...the liquid metallic look is only useful if you're going to be a male stripper.  Otherwise, you've got liquid metal up your crack...not very appealing	0
Great price - aprons are perfect for my mom.  She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job.  The Company sent them out right away; would order again. Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from.  I order two packages, with 3 in each package	1
You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them. 	0
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!	1
I agree.  Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy	0
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it	1
the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure	0
"To echo another reviewer:
I am a heavy runner with high (semi-flexible) arches and a neutral stride, running 20-35 miles per week. Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length, pronation,and heal-to-toe gait, I tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe.
I am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos (the shoe designed for the ""clydesdale type"" runner), a pair of Adidas Adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly), and some various pairs of New Balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the Mizuno Wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling, durable, light-weight, cushioned (without being bulky) shoe I have ever owned. I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7's and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). That and the Mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference.  

I would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues."	1
I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head	0
"This is an excellent bra.  In addition to being sexy, it is also quite functional.  It defines one's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support.  This particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black.  

Chantelle bras are made according to French standards.  You get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long.  Still, it's an excellent bra"	1
This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back	0
For years, I wore Asics. The GT, the Cumulus, the Nimbus. But I have to say, if you're fan of any Asics shoes named after clouds, you should try the Trigon 4. Very similar, but cheaper. Also they did not joke when they called it the Ride. It has a very smooth transition and insane cushion, but a little more support than Asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight. A big thumbs (toes?) up	1
"I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. 

All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort"	0
I have had a pair of these for several years; they were an incredibly lucky find. They're *extremely* comfortable, better than many pairs of sneakers I've tried on. They've worn very well, and I'd say they're well made: I've only had to replace the shoelaces once. A bit of polish, some Kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water, and they're perfect. Trust me, you can walk for miles in them, and they look great, I think. A great purchase. If you're looking for a pair of dress shoes, and nervous about buying them without trying them on, well... my feet love them. Don't know how far that will carry yours, but there's my two cents. Excellent	1
These slippers are anything but comfortable. Besides the sizing being to small, I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid's slipper. The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone's foot, and the inside material is also anything but comfortable.	0
I was very, very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat.  It fit perfectly and was ahit with Mom and Dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months.  I found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you can't do better on this buy	1
It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT	0
"This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch.

There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.	0
I have several jackets. They are well made, warm and I wouldn't wear any other. Long lasting and look good with anything	1
This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it	0
"These shoes are adorable and perfect for summer!! I love mine!!

"These boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest. I was pleasantly surprised. I was trying to replace a pair I had accidentally washed in the washing machine (a no-no with this fabric). Turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what I had originally purchased. I will probably be purchasing more. 
Your wife will thank you for buying these. Excellent quality, and softer than satin. My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes, because it's made without a fastener. The idea is for a sleeker feel, but it sacrifices security. Love 'em anyway"	1
This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite	0

Minimzer is correct, I bought this bra in a 38DDD and it made me look more like a D or DD. It lifted and minim1zed my breasts. My only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point. If you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you.	1
the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it	0
These are the coolest things ever made. I have been searching for a product like this forever and I could only find what used to be called &quot;lingerie helpers&quot; from the 50's or 60's (I think) which didn't quite do the job.  No more buying those &quot;speciality&quot; bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn't quite fit right. I just put these on my favorite bra and don't even know it is there.  Now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts. I am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and I am not!!!	1
I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).	0
These are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price.  I wear a Large in most shirts and the Large size for these fits snug, especially after a wash, which is how I like it for wearing as an undershirt.  If you're buying for outerwear, you might consider going a size larger. Shipping wasn't 'Amazon Quick' but it was reasonable - about a week if I remember right	1
I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P.O. Box but the seller used UPS which won't send packages to P.O. Boxes so I gave an alternate address.

Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust.

I do roofing work & work outside on the hotest days. I had problems with heat rash & jock itch. My boss suggested I wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew. I asked around & picked up some HANES all cotton boxes. WOW - what a difference -- they feel great. No binding when I work - the cotton does give a bit as you wear them. Now they are the only underwear I will wear. They do shrink a bit after washing - so do get a size up 	1

First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift.

I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.  	0
These boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look. The fit is right on and they are very warm and dry. i love them! They are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into. Highly recommended	1

I only use the protective case/skin, not the armband or belt clip.  I primarily wanted protection for the screen, which this provides.

I have not used the armband, but it looks pretty sturdy.  I paid $18.90 for this item including $5.95 shipping	1
I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas. I can't return them  because he wore them for a day. These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers. The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left. Don't waste your money	0

I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt.

"I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.

The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!

"My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  

I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!

I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.

"I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty ""spillover"" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last"	1

"I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of ""wool-blend"".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.

I purchased this bag to take on a tour of Greece and was pretty happy with it.  I loved the size, not to big and not too small, and also the flatness of it.  It was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible.

Overall it was pretty good, though	1
In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.

I have owned and worn this for several months now, and it is very durable AND warm as well!

Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.

I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!!

These boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts. Because they are real leather, I was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable - but it only took a few wearings before I could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet.

Even if you don't consider the great price for all leather boots, they are wonderful buy	1
apparently there is an error in the item description. these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive. I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway... stupid me.	0

"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on.

"I picked this sucker up for $30 from Fred Meyer, after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my iPod from my computer (I was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery). I was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation, but I've been using it ever since.

I keep the car charger in my car, with no extra cables to burden it, and I keep the wall charger plugged into the wall. The cable retracts easily, with a design much like that of a window blind (pull until you let go, where it locks, and then pull a bit more and let go to release).

It's a small, unobtrusive, and incredibly convenient device for your iPod, and at this price, it's a steal. You'd pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone, let alone one that is so solidly constructed.

No question -- if you own an iPod, purchase this product. I was impressed enough to come and write this review -- perhaps you will be too"	1

"I really like the Speedo suit.  I wear two swim suits, the Speedo and a larger ""drag"" suit over it.  I've done this since my days on the swim team.

The fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement I've needed in years.

I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.

"When I saw in a magazine that Croc was making a style of their shoes that was NOT UGLY, I literally went the same day to Dillard's to get a pair for myself! They are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you're standing on clouds!

The Amazon listing doesn't show all the colors that they come in: light pink, silver, gold, celery, lavender, light blue, white, black and fuschia. All the colors are really adorable, and I had a hard time deciding!

I have also had issues with sizing, just as other reviewers have had. I usually wear a 7.5 Wide in women's shoes, but when I tried on the Primas in an 8, they were ridiculously big, and when i tried them on in a 7, they were a tad too snug. I really wish they made half sizes. I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toasty warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!

Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra	0
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow	1

These boots are GORGEOUS! I got such an awesome deal on these boots; I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! I'll put one up here. They're comfy, rich leather, well made. I've always wanted Frye boots	1
"I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as

The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all. 	0
I just got these and love them.  My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes.  The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer.  If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice	1

Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.

Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable	0

This bra fits very well (I found it fit very true to size) and offers great support.  I'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices I've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support.  It has held up well while jogging. 	1

This is the best sports bra I've ever had!  I show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that, as I gaited the dog around the ring, I was bouncing!  Now, no more bounce and extreme comfort.

"I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a ""run"" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-("	0
"This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!

I have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. 

When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. 

I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!

I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...

PROS
------
1) Attaches securely
2) Removes with VERY little or no pain
3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. 
4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)
5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. 
6) Washable and reusable
7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. 
8) When properly applied you will not leak
9) Peace of mind 
10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. 

CONS
-------
1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.
2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort
3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.
4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. 

As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!

This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List	1

A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.

I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra	0

As with all longjohns I have found on the market in the past forty-plus years, the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6'(now) or 6'2"" (back then).  Sadly, I never see them listed in ""Tall Sizes,"" and, as always before, I have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over...to make sure my waist is protected. "	1
"These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.

I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.

This is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. Feels good on your head. I have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too. keeps your head dry.
I also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house"	1

I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far	1
The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars	0
I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS. I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID.

Tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable. The stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix. GOOD DEAL	1
This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	0

"I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, ""The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability."" That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off.

I recommend buying another model.."	0
The zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job, the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly, easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	1

"These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a ""pouch"", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it.

The briefs also run about a size small. I have a 31"" waist but the mediums are too small."	1

I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used.	0
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to	1
Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.	0

I first saw this WebUndies outfit when my friend Sara brought them to our lingerie party and I have to admit, with all the other hot looking stuff there, I didn't have too much hope for these. Well, was I ever wrong. You don't need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man. These will do the trick. If your guy hasn't been paying you the kind of attention you've been wanting, get a pair of these, wear them to bed like pjs, climb under the covers, roll over pretend to go to sleep. I'm betting he won't let ya	1

The New Balance Men's M587 Running Shoe has been an excellent running shoe.  It has a built in rollbar that prevent shin-splints and the shoes are extremely comfortable to run-in.

"I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.

My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory. 

Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport."	0

"I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the ""Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra"" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the ""Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra,"" which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).

So, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.

This bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck"	1
This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!!	0
This bra is the best nursing bra I have found.  It is very supportive and comfortable.  I like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you.  It holds up very well in the wash.  I would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them. 	1
"I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the ""Aluminum"" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.

This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon	0

Great boots.  Perfect for playing in the rain.  Great Quality.  I bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season.  No problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size.  We previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs	1

I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.

I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up	1
I will be returning this item to the vendor.  I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery.  Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image.

The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...	0
Very satisfied with my purchase. The item was a Christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect. Amazon was the only place I could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site	1
"While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy.

This jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for FedEx envelopes. Sounds cool, huh? The jacket is extremely thin, and feels like you're wearing a paper bag. While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian, they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks"	0

The jacket is cut undersized, typical of foreign makes with poor quality control. The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity. Exterior shell has nice feel, but overall, a poor piece of work	0
This is a great pair of shoes and a good to have n your collection.It is a subtle silver and looks absolutely delicate on your feet.BUT it is one size smaller than normal.I usually wear a 8.5M and this turned out to be small for me.I do fit into it but my toe juts out a little bit.A 9M would have been better.But I dont have the patience to return it,so I am gonna keep it.Its a lovely pair of shoes	1

Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.   "	0
I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt	1
 This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.	0

"I bought two of these as a gift for my husband.  He'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed.  These were ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required, took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had, and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from.  The cushioned tie ""hooks"" ensure the ties will not slip off, and also that they will not be damaged.  A breeze to organize his vast tie collection.  And he's loving this product"	1
I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe	0
The shoes are awesome...my daughter LOVES them! Business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction	1
The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors, and make it so I cannot wear them at work.  I love Rockports in general, and these are comfortable and well made as expected, but they leave a trail of scuff marks	0
"I found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely. Follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their Scotchgaurding. 
TIP: Make sure you wash them before you wear them. 
I would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability, comfort, and/or needing a professional look in the garments they wear.
NOTE: If you are looking for extra pockets go the Dickies cargo route. These do not have any extra pockets"	1
Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more durable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they ripped in the back.  The immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look!	0
I still love this bra!  It's great for casual wear, sleeping etc.  It does solve the back fat problem, however there is no lift and separate for me.

"We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field(mainly insulation instalation) which requires him to climb in high places, walk on trusses, and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions. In my opinion these boots DO NOT have ""heavy duty"" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying ""Made in China"" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them. If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they're perfect"	0
Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size.   I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size.	1
We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.

I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.	0

This case is so cute and matches my green iPod perfectly.  I read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the iPod, but I haven't had that problem.  The belt clip works great with this and feels very secure.  The other review said the cut-out for the wheel is off a little, and I guess she is right.  Looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel isn't centered, but it is completely accesible and I have no trouble using it.  Overall I love this case	1
"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.

I bought this for my husband and am so impressed.  Nice and thick, and incredibly soft and huggable.  I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores. The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise.  Sturdy shipping box, and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required.  There was even a hand-written thank you note included.  I am more than satisfied. 	1
Like I said, they didn't fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive. :	0
The megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes. It has a nice feel to it. The bathrobe is made of Japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100% cotton. Cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable. I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so.	1

"This is a heavy/thick robe, I expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly. I am 5'8"" and the sleeves are only slightly to long but, I don't even notice now.

I cant speak on durability as I've only had it for a month or so but, you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel. I got the brown color and I love it, I feel like grisly adams in this thing.."	1
I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !  	0

At first I was bugged by how sticky this was, but boy did it work! They gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it, but that's another story!)

I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running.  I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.  And the color is fun, too	1

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.

The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why:

Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares	0
These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth. They are right on the mark. I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart, but because I simply have to have more than one pair	1
This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves	0

This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.

I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.
In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. 
It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. 
The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. 

This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. 

I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price.

"It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  

The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  

The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  

This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area. "	1

They also have very ""hard"" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.

Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.

I had bought a bra of this model at a discount store, just got lucky.  It quickly became my favorite, and I was glad to find it at Amazon. 	1
"I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend ""Jogbra"" or ""Chamion"" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted."	0

I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again	0

"I got custom fit for this bra at Nordstrom's and I am so happy that I purchased it - among others that day. I had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down. Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a ""light"" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a ""bump"" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1"" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to ""them"" being so ""out there in front."" So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you. I love it so much that I now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as I am very fair skinned."	1

I'm a big guy. Heck, I'll just admit; I'm a fat guy. However, I am also simply large-framed (broad-shouldered, barrel-chested). I got the largest size possisble to accomodate my stomach and my large chest (largest available is a chest measurement of 60, my chest is 58), and while the coat looks pretty good on me, the shoulders are extremely constricting and I have heard the seam in the back pulling if I move my arms too quickly or too far. If you have unusual proportions like me, I reccomend biting the bullet and getting a tailor-made coat elsewhere. Still, though, the coat is quite warm and looks pretty nice on me, so if you are of relatively normal dimensions, you can add a star to this review when considering a purchase	1
I was so excited to find these, they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort.  They look weird.  They went straight back, and after paying shipping and return shipping, I practically have to pay them to take it back:-	0
This boonie hat is collapsible, yet has a firm rim. Chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds. This is the hat that will conceal you in the woods, but gets noticed about town.

I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman.

We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement	0

i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me & my son's feet. his feet have been sized as extra wide (!!) and these socks fit wonderfully, in his size, without being stretched tight. i love the high cotton content & the cushioned soles. these are well made socks & i will be buying from this brand when it's time for the next size up	1

I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day.  We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new!

"I'm really surprised at the negative reviews on these wipers. I bought two pairs of wipers just over a year ago, expecting I'd have the second pair as backup. I haven't needed the second pair - the first pair are still just like new - they don't squeak, chatter, or smear and are great for visibility. I live in Seattle, so it's not like I never use them either - we've been deluged by rain in the last year!

The only thing I can think is that maybe others are mistreating their wiper blades. Keep your windshield clean, and if the wipers are smearing, just wipe the cleaning edge off with a paper towel from time to time. That's not a problem with the blade, that's a problem with the cleanliness of your windshield and blade. Any wiper blade struggles when it's bogged down with dirt, pollen, and road grime.

I figure eventually I'll use my backup pair, but until then I'm happy"	1

I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money	0
"These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2"", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades"	1
I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one	0

"I bought this product on a whim.  I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale.  Curious, I gave it a try.

First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water.  After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  It feels like spray painting.

Then you wait for the water to evaporate.  Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.

Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit.  It's as though it left a residue.  I'm not sure what it is.

But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way .."	0

"I hooked up a small 20 watt Solar System at my home. Bought this Sunforce 60012 7 amp Charge Controller and everything worked Great. The LED came on and the controller sent the power to the battery even in low cloudy days with no sun.  I saw some hype online about MorningStar's 'SunGuard SG-4' (& it's PWM) and it's fancy line graph showing how it was far superior to other controllers. Bought one for $27.oo and $11.oo shipping tacked on from another vendor), swapped it out with this SUNFORCE 60012 Controller hoping for a big improvement. Waited for morning... and put my volt meter on the system only to find the SunGuard SG-4 (with NO LED) was still sound asleep! Zero volts passing through it! So I immediately removed the SunGuard SG-4 and re-installed the SUNFORCE 60012 Charge Controller I purchased here from Amazon. Poof... back to producing 12 Volts from my solar panels and the hazy sky had no sign of sun. The SunGuard SG-4 is now on it's way to the local landfill... and the SUNFORCE 60012 has a permanent home in my home solar power system. Sunforce's LED is glowing and the Solar 12 Volts are flowing to my battery again. Stick with the SUNFORCE 60012 it is far superior and WORKS like it's supposed to. Call me old-fashioned... I think that's why I bought the SUNFORCE (& the 'SunGuard SG-4' ~ 4 amp w/ No LED )in the first place? # SUNFORCE 60012 7 amp Charge Controller #: Low price and High Quality and it actually does what it's supposed to do!

i think the people who give one stars aren't following the directions...wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly (even in texas)...i don't think it really matters how you wash it; using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots...the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product...also the filter doesn't as long as i would like...this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle..	1

"I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good!

- You first rinse off your vehicle with regular, unfiltered water either through the AutoDry gun or with your regular hose sprayer.

- Next, you use the AutoDry on the ""soap"" setting and completely cover the vehicle.  They advise to only use the Mr. Clean soap, of course, because it contains agents not normally found in other car washing soap that assists in the sheeting action (similar to Jet Dry for the dishwasher)

- Thirdly, you give the vehicle an old fashioned hand wash with a sponge.  Make sure you do a good job and clean it completely or you will find streaks when it dries with the old dirty water smeared all over.

- Fourth, rinse the vehicle completely with unfiltered water.  Make sure you are very through in this stage.  Take your time!

- Finally, set the AutoDry to the filtered rinse setting and go over the vehicle again.  Make sure you start at the vehicle's highest point to remove all the tap water sitting on the roof.  Basically, you want the filtered water to remove all the unfiltered water.  Spray the filtered water in all the crevices to avoid spots later (side view mirrors, bumpers, etc.)

Although it sounds like it takes a long time it is really quite quick if you put some effort into it.  I can do a complete vehicle (Ford Explorer) start to finish in about 15 minutes.  The car dries completely spot free EVERY time!  Of course, the results will only be as good as YOU make them.  If you don't wash completely or rinse the unfiltered water off completely there WILL be spots.  It is up to you to do a through job to get great results"	1

The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.

I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it.

"Although I have not tried other models of the California duster, I really like this design. Since this model has dusting tassles all the way around, you simple rotate the duster after each wipe. This will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot. This design also works well for dusting the underside of my car's spoiler.

This has twice the dusting surface, it is faster and does the same great job.  I have a black Town and Country which shows dust!  This does a great job in just a few minutes.  A great product	1
"I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:

- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve
- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.
- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel"	0
This duster is heavy duty, does a great job and is much bigger that I thought it would be. Overall I am very happy with this item. If you need a car duster this one is a home run	1
"If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!

AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway. 

I would NOT BUY AGAIN"	0
"The Super Duster has been very efficient in removing dust off my new 2005 Camry XLE and keeping her shiny between washes. Along with trimming car wash expenses, the full knitting minimizes twists of the wrist inherent with one-sided dusters to keep upright.

I recommend this product most highly.

"It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.

The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.

I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.

Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it"	0
I just bought a new white convertible and this product is the greatest for quickly removing dust and light dirt. I am using it daily as it is so easy and quick. Car is spotless after 3 weeks of heavy driving, and I haven't needed to use my free car wash from the dealer	1
"As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a ""racing"" gauge is ridiculous"	0
The powerball products work well, if you have wheels and other billet goodies  this will become your best buddy	1
"I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.

Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.

If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240."	0

I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better.

It would disappear before i could read it fully.	0
I like to think of my self as a responsible driver but when I get a ticket for going over 10mph I get really ticked off.  I searched trough the internet trying to find a solution for these ridicules tickets and I found the reflector cover.  This stuff is amazing, I have seen a flash go off while I pass trough speed camera.  It's been almost 2 months and I still didn't get any ticket.  I think everyone should protect themselves with the reflector cover because the cameras are there to collect revenue instead of protecting the public	1

I kept getting tickets in the mail for going through EZ pass tool booth out here in New York city. My sticker was valid and I had money in my account.

They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product.

I bought a pair of the reflector about a year ago. I love them. I haven't got a ticket since. Now I drive with confidences.

"I've never used any other type of oil filter wrench or strap but this tool worked for me when I couldn't twist off an oil filter by hand.  It uses a 3/8"" drive but it doesn't ""snap"" onto the wrench so it can fall off easily.  As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem and it will save you a lot of time when changing your oil filter.

The prongs can be adjusted by holding onto the ""base"" and turning the socket with a wrench.  The prongs rotate around the base depending on the direction you turn.  The way it works is that at the widest position, turning in either direction will cause the prongs to ""close in"" on a certain direction.  That way, as long as you have the prongs closing in on the proper direction, when you are trying to remove an oil filter, it will grip harder as you turn counter-clockwise.  If you have the prongs closing in on the wrong direction, then turning counter-clockwise will actually widen the prongs"	1

"The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.

I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.

OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.

To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. So I'm left wondering what good this is	0

I am extremely happy with this quality AAA Vehicle Emergency Kit from Auto Barn.  It has everything a stranded traveller would need except water, food, blankets and a quarter for a pay phone.  My biggest dread in purchasing an all inclusive car kit is getting a cheap compressor, cheap jumper cables and a cheap flashlight.  Cables are a thick enough (8 guage) and long enough--10 feet.  The compressor seems solid and is rated at 250 psi.  The flashlight is rubber-encased with a good quality O-ring to keep moisture out of the body, and batteries are included.  All this with basic tools comes in a well-organized, attractive and durable carrying case. I ordered a competitor's product and CHEAP EVERYTHING is what I got--half the price but it was all WORTHLESS JUNK.  Not so with this kit from Auto Barn and AAA.

"If you've seen the movie ""Cars"" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the ""Radiator Springs"" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.

Sure - it says ""New Car Scent"", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but I would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  First of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a Hummer.  It is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors.
 
I can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a Friday afternoon) I vacated the premises under duress, and by Monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  I've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people.
 
To be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  And why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  The claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, I couldn't recommend it.

"I have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now.  In that time there have been TWO attempts by car thieves to take my car (a Honda Civic).  

The first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on (door was open, things shuffled about).  This was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of Honda Civic thefts (there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months--which is what inspired me to buy this).  Given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed, the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself.

The second attempt was by a much more aggressive would-be thief.  This one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time.  When I got to my car the next morning, the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right, however the lock remained solidly in place.  They even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off.  They had no such luck.  The pedal cover was replaced for $10 and all was well.

I would trust any car to this in any situation.  Certainly you should use an alarm as well, and be conscious about where you leave your car, but this is a fantastic deterrent.

The description clearly indicates WATERPROOF, but in fact it is mostly water RESISTANT, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation!
the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).
the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.
the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.
the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.

"Unit appears to be solidly constructed.  Maybe I lucked out and got an upgraded version, but there have been a couple of reviewers that said the the plastic clamps snapped.  The unit I have (manufactured 11/06) has ALL METAL clamps, very much nicer than many regular standard jumper cables.

 

This unit will hold a charge but needs to be maintained (recharged) at least every 60 days or so. 

 

NEVER charge via the cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle longer than 3-4 hours.  It may be left on AC charge indefinately.  It is better to keep it fully charged, discharging this unit will result in shorted cells.

 

All in all, a very small price to pay for peace of mind, at home and on the road.  With a power inverter (less than $20.00) you can have silent power source for lights, cell phones, small tv's, laptops, flourescent lights, etc."	1

"T. Dorau -- when properly stored, what you complain about will never happen.  A battery should -never- be stored in sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures.  Don't leave it in the garage!

This unit offers ""quick"" recharging (4 to 5 hours) from a 12V source or gradual recharging (12 to 24 hours) from an AC source.

The AC source may be left connected indefinitely (true ""float"" charging) which is a plus for a standby power source.  The inclusion of the LED light source is very thoughtful on the part of the designer(s).

In addition to jump starting a car, this is a good choice for small household items (TV, Radio, Weather Alert Radio) or emergency communications equipment (CB, Ham Radio).

I'm using this product to power a small electric trolling motor that I use as emergency power for my small inflatable sailboat.  For that purpose, it is performing well -- giving me the 30 minute usage per unit that I thought it would.  I would like a better indication of how much charge is left in the battery.  The three lights (low, medium, high) are OK but not as accurate an indicator as I think a meter or more lights would have been.   I like the 12V outlet to power accesories in the boat.  I do not need the DC-to-DC charging option. Charge time has been good.  Maybe this winter I'll keep a charged unit in my vehicle and actually use the unit for its intended purpose.    	1
"March 14 FOLLOW UP REPORT: Pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. Teresa K. Naeole of Q. Industries by phone said I could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. Returned pump was received at 159 Islington on February 16 at 12:55 pm. I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul

I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.

The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.

I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution"	0

Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work.  I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener.  Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position	0
"This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should.
There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up.
First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings.
Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions).
The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage.

Very Nice Gauge"	1
 You are better off with a sponge and a bucket . There ain't a quick fix to washing your car without going to the local car wash	0
"I wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models. This gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use. My favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve. With other gauges, you have to put in air, then check the gauge, put in air, check it again. With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI.

Assuming this lasts a long time, I would recommend it to everyone"	1
Arrived with dead batteries in it, factor the price and time of getting three AAA batteries on your own into your decision of whether to buy this product or not	0
"Jan. 21 Update:  I got the low-battery indication while using the gauge, and it turns out that the LR1130 batteries are alkaline, not lithium as both the product packaging and instructions say they are.  The batteries are indeed very easily replaced, and I'm replacing them with the silver oxide equivalent (SR1130W), as the original batteries apparently weren't the freshest (although they were Hitachi-Maxell).  I continue to like this gauge very much.

I think this is a great product at a great price (currently $35 total), and I just bought a 2nd one to lend so others can see for themselves (don't want to be without mine in case it doesn't come back).

Very simple to connect and take a reading, and when bleeding air the numbers drop with the drop in air pressure, so I can reach the exact pressure I want quickly.  The batteries are user replaceable, but they are lithium (LR1130) and are expected to last more than several years (the packaging suggests they will last the life of the gauge, as ""permanent power"").  The gauge can be zeroed (recalibrated) simply by turning it on without any air pressure in the hose, confirming that the display reads ""0.0,"" and waiting until the display goes off (20 sec. when no pressure is present and 60 sec. when there is pressure present).

While the gauge display reads to a tenth of a pound, the actual stated accuracy in the instructions is plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 PSI, which suggests that the real accuracy is within about 0.2 to 0.8 pound, which is still better than any other gauge I've seen or used.

The instructions explain things well enough (they read as though they were translated into English, but still completely understandable), and the listed Web site for the actual manufacturer, Measurement Ltd., Inc. (in New Jersey), provides contact info. for user inquiries.

I like using this gauge (it's quick and easy), and that makes maintaining my tire pressure at the proper level simple to do consistently (along with a good portable air compressor, like the TyphoonMax TX-500, which I also really like)."	1
"My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those ""just in case"" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?

We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.

I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable"	0

"Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find.

"We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound. 

Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.

 Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job."	0
I have used these to change the oil on my 2006 Chevy Silverado 4x4.  They work like a champ.  There is plenty of room underneath.  They seem very sturdy.  My only complaint is - my truck kept moving the ramps.  I had to put it in 4 wheel drive to get up them.  This should not be an issue with a front wheel drive.  I also have a 2001 Nissan Maxima.  The ramps fit under the air dam nicely on the Nissan.  I will use these for that vehicle also.  One last note:  The name implies these ramps can hold 12,000 lbs.  This is not the case.  They are actually rated at 3,000 lbs each.  This is plenty of capacity for my full size truck, and for any car I know of	1

We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money	0
I used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. The parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. It does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. We used it on 20-30 cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! Purchased one for myself, so I guess that's a good recommendation	1
One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all	0
If you wash your car yourself, you should have this.  Once you have the Blade, you only need one small towel for drying edges.  The Blade does all the work for you.  It's fabulous.  My neighbor who washes his car weekly has one and I saw him use it and was amazed at how well it worked.  He said he has owned a Blade for years and gives them as gifts. Then I saw another neighbor using one. I gave them to my husband and adult sons and they love them.  My eight year old also thinks it is now fun to wash the car... THAT is priceless	1

"I had this alarm professionally installed by PepBoys (which is DesignTech's recommended professional installer). After the initial installation with all the wiring was done, PepBoys found out that the brain was defective. They confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. After being on the phone with DesignTech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and I just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided.

"You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint. I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it. 

I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.

I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!

I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia"	1

I am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more.  As long as the surface is dry, it works wonderfully.  Once some contaminants start to build on the paint, use the duster, then some Quick Detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean.  My cars always look new with these things.  I just traded in my 2004 RX-8 after 2.5 years of using the duster, and it still looked absolutely new.  I now use it on my 2006 Lancer Evolution and, again, the car looks brand-new (which it is).

We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.	0

"I first got one of these as a gift back in the late '80s when I bought my first new car. It worked exactly as advertised and in the intervening years, I have replaced it only two or three times... 

It does actually work better once it gets dirtier - I can absolutely attest to this as I got a new one about a year ago, and the older one worked better at first... After a couple weeks (I dust the car about about four times a day), it started to work as well as the older one. I took the old one and tried washing it by hand with cold ater and Woolite, as recommended on the makers website, and it definitely was cleaner and still worked just as well.

I think I must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated.  It never dried to a haze for me.  The first time i used it I thought I hadn't shaken the bottle enough.

Works great ONLY if you have dry dusts. If the dust is wet, or was wet and now dried, it doesn't work. Otherwise, great as a touch up dusting in between washings.	1

It is a simple device, and it is easy to imagine enhancements that would improve it, yet it is as advertised and does just what I wanted it to do. It sits in a shallow cardboard box between the seats of my old Nissan where it is perfectly level and will not shift around while I'm driving, so I set it up just before I leave for work. I work close to my home, so my morning commute is about ten minutes, about the time it takes the Wagan to brew my coffee. A larger cup with a brew-through lid would make it safer for use while the car is in motion, which the manufacturer recommends against, still I am very happy with it and have no complaints.	1
I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up.

"gimmick.
There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires."	0

I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT	0

This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.	0

This product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows.

This little machine is capable of pulling so much current, that it would blow most fuses for Cigarette lighters, which is why the adapter isn't included. It needs to be clipped directly to the battery, and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes.	1
Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model.  However, it is also dim.  Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  Very disappointing.  After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit.  I did not purchase from Amazon.  Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down.  Turns out there is no warranty.  Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it	0
"My MV-50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine, it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery. The gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi, so it is off by 5psi! The gauge reads: 0,5,10,15,20,25. At 20psi, it is showing 25psi.  

The only confusion is what I found on the internet for some people paying only $25 for this and not $70 plus shipping charges.

The connector is not useful for tight spaces, like a rear motorcycle tire on my Yamaha 650 Maxim. 

I think it is going to perform to my racing needs."	1
after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.	0
"I bought this compressor with the intent of airing my tires back up after a day of 4-wheeling. For this purpose, it works amazingly. It comes with an awesome carrying case, and everything else you would expect with a portable air compressor...it will air up my tires quickly--the specs state about 4 minutes to air up a 35"" tire.

When running, the compressor is pretty quiet and doesn't vibrate and bounce around. The built-in gauge is quite accurate once the unit is turned off. 

In short...buy this air compressor if you have ANY use for it at all. It will easily beat compressors which cost over 3 times what this unit does"	1
"Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.  

It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website.

I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.

I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe	0
Its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking.   Clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off. I dont really buy any of those as seen on TV items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping.  Remember this works best when over about 40mph... and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea	1
"When the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light.  This was a fluorescent version.  The replacement unit- quickly sent by Amazon -was LED.  The same case and everything but with bright LEDs inside.  I liked it much better than the fluorescent one.    
The second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted.  Then the LEDs would start blinking.  Like an emergency light.  Sunforce said that this was not normal behavior.  I returned it as well.  The light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use.  A nice product but quallity needs to be improved"	0
This stuff is the best example I can think of, of a product that not only works but far exceeded my expectations.  As one reviewer mentioned, it will cause wintertime ice to easily flake off.  Ditto for summertime bug removal.  It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars).  I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+.  No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear.  MANY TIMES I have driven to a call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility. And I find that it lasts for several weeks on a car that is not garaged.  My highest recommendation.  Three thumbs up!  Oops - make that two thumbs up	1

"First of all '11 cubic feet' means a little for me so if you were wondering about the dimesions of this bag, look no further (because nor even in lund's web site you could find this valuable information). The dimensions labeled in the box are 44""x36""x16"" (l,w,h). So far I stuffed it with six letter size stackable white cardboard boxes like those you find at Office Depot (15.5""x12.5""x11"") intended for your backlog (by Willamette), it's not easy at first glance but, believe it or not, there's enough room for them. Te curb of the aerodinamic shape ends some 18"" from the front side to the back to reach the 16"" claimed. For me it seems like a parabolic shape because the height continues to increase slightly up to around 18"" in the backside. With my 6 backlog boxes in place there's still some 26""x36""x5"" of room above them.

Material seems to be strong, the only think I don't like is the zipper wich seems to be regular one not one intended to support strong wind force. Well, in two weeks I'll tell you what happened with this bag during my 600 mile trip.

This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well	0

"I received it, charged it up, and went out and used it to crank up my lawnmower that had been sitting up all winter. She cranked right up. A friend borrowed it to crank up his KIA. The battery was dead. The KIA cranked right up without any problems. Excellent.

The only draw back is that the positive and negative leads are very short (thus, 4 stars). When I jump a car battery I like to hook the negative lead up away from the battery to avoid spraks and a possible explosion from battery fumes. (It happens and a battery post flying through the air can mess up your day.) This can't be done with the Mity-Mite because (again) the leads are too short.

Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA:

You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.

But does it really do that? 

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?

Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. 

""I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day,"" Black said. ""I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing.""

After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV. 

The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. 

But does it really do that?

On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.

The only thing you need is a pair of scissors.

Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.

We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.

The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in.

Next comes the weather stripping.

So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.

While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.

One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.

We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside. 

But just to be fair, we test one more car.

We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees.

We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees. 

While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes. 

In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.

Will it work this time? 

Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.

Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. 

Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.

Don't waste your money on this one. "	0
I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now.  It won't charge.  I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks.  I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well.  I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires	1

I sort of like that it doesn't have a trigger device, as it avoids accidentally spraying the vehicle when you don't want to. Another plus is you don't have to wash your car with a bucket full of dirty water. The super-fast jet spray setting is not that useful for me, but I'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it. I don't agree with the reviewer who said it causes more water spots. I don't think they used it right. If you wash your car pretty often, this kit comes recommended	1
"this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad.
Also they are hard to place with powered windows"	0
I'm a female senior citizen.  I live on a 1 1/2 mile dirt road and commute 40 miles to another rural community (without a car wash)daily.  I really like a clean car.  In the past I would have the car washed on the rare occasions that I went to the big city.  Or wash it at home and deal with the mud underneath the car, etc.  It also snows here and there are times I can't wash the car.  This unit is unbelievable!  I love it.  NO water spots and it's easy to use.  There was a little leakage from the unit, however it's probably just an old woman not able to tighten enough.  I highly recommend this.  I washed two cars in 25 minutes	1
This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??	0
I've had this system for over a year, and it does in fact work as advertised.  I follow the procedure as described by Mr Pruss and end up with little or no water spots.  You do have to pay particular attention to any nooks where unfiltered tap water can accumulate and but sure to flush them well with filtered water in that last step. Failure to do so may end up with a trickle of unfiltered water running down the car as it dries.   I also echo the complaints about the soap compartment cap and lack of a good on-off trigger.  With the really hard water we have in So-Cal, I get maybe 8 vehicles washed on one filter cartridge.  I find it takes about half the time to wash my car and truck with this system vs drying by hand.  One other observation: the soap compartment has a line for maximum fill.  I got the impression, the time I accidently went way over that line, that a little soap was being dispensed along with unfiltered and filtered rinse water.  Or maybe soap was just oozing out of the contraption and getting into the rinse water that way.  Otherwise, I'm surprised how happy I am with it	1
This product does not cool down the car.  It is too small.  I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe	0
"Though I still encounter products not worth the time to laugh at, I have noticed more and more products coming to market that actually meet and sometimes beat expectations. 

Well, the Mr. Clean AutoDry Met expectations, though it does have a couple flaws.

I've owned this product since it first hit the store shelves, after a very hyped up Television marketing deal... I figured that if I bought it at Target and it does not work to my satisfaction, Target will give me my money back. I tried it, and it worked perfectlly. I knew from prior experience that de-ionised water will not leave spots as it is the ions of molecules in the water that are left behind when the water molecules evaporate. Remove those ions and there is nothing to be left behind. I was a little sceptical that such a small filter would work well, however, but for the most part, it has worked acceptably, but as the unit has some flaws, I should list them...

Flaw 1) The soap filler cap was badly designed. If there is any soap left in the unit when you store it, you have to be sure to store it so that the cap is upright (it is on the units side, not the top), else you will find a puddle of congealed, semi-dry soap when you pull it off the shelf a week later! There is no work around for this except to remember to store the unit upright, or lay on the other side.

Flaw 2) lack of a trigger for flow control. The unit uses a VERY peculiar flip switch which is a little difficult to flip on and off easily. It's not terrible, but a trigger like a garden sprayer would be SO much better!

Flaw 3) The hose connector does not turn freely... As you walk around the car, the hose twists and the water pressure tries to twist it back... This might be limited to the unit I purchased, but either way, it has been quite annoying. I found a perfect work around for this, though it did cost me a few extra dollars. I bought a hose quick disconnect that spins quite freely. it was a little expensive ($6, but works better than any other I have ever tried, and I simple screwed one end onto the autodry and the other onto the hose, and got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each) for the other spray heads I use, and it's all good.

Other than the above three flaws, I am quite pleased with this product, and use it routinely. I can wash my car in about 30 minutes, and I am quite particular...

Here is the procedure I follow:

1) I quickly rinse down the whole car to get any dirt wet.
2) I then spray a section of the car, usually starting with the roof, with the soap
3) using a super soft, laundered wool wash mitt, I gently ""scrub"" the soaped area, and quickly rinse with unfiltered water, and ensure that the entire car remains wet.
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other parts of the car (i.e. hood, trunk, sides, etc.),
5) Using the filtered water, starting from the high points of the car (i.e. roof) and working down to the sills, I completely rinse off the whole car and then let it dry, sun or shade. I've never had any spots whatsoever, except when the filter turns brown (which indicates the filter is exhausted)"	1
If you have tinted windows this product does not work	0
"After reading the review from Max I just had to let others know this product realy does work great. It also saves me time. Max's problem may be his whole process is flawed I never read the directions that may be how the product tells you to do it, however all I do is simple.

Wet the car (in my case truck) down with the regular water then wash the car,truck from the top down I use a microfiber towel and have the towel in one hand and the MrClean autowash in the other. I wash with soap and rinse as I go around the car,truck.
When it is all washed down re-rinse with regular water from the top down, change to the filtered water and rinse again from the top down. I do this part rather quickley it sprays just like a spray paint gun. then just let it sit and dry.

The reason I only give the product 4 stars is. The seal cap on the soap compartment leakes in storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it on its side. And they really needed a trigger for the water controll, on and off.

I had used this all last summer im sure I washed my truck at least 20 times. and my water filter still worked fine. It may be my process and how fast I get around the truck or I may have cleaner water then what they say as only 10 washes per filter. I am back here to get a new one, beacuse I had kept it outside and well I cant expect it to hold up to a hard freeze can I? heh"	1

It does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it. I wouldn't suggest this product	0
I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!	1
This thing does not install in seconds as suggested,it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you're supposed to put in the window with it. Who want's to fool with that everytime? It also says to not use with tinted windows, something that could have been mentioned here	0
This is a good product for the price. My only concern is when changing batteries the adhesive tape might be useless and must be replaced. I recomend it for use in the closed or in the kitchen under cabinet	1
Installation of these blades is not straightforward--three adapter pieces and a pin are included, which might work well enough, but the instructions provided with the product could not be more of a joke. I'll be returning to the store and asking one of their employees (at Kragen) to install all three blades (they're nice enough there, if you're willing to wait). In the future, I won't be buying this product when I need new blades. I don't mind a bit of complication in installing stuff like this, but the instructions should be adequate to the task, and they're really not	0
Just be careful when using it in tinted windows. They filter out the sun and the motor doesn't spin	1
"I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it."	0
I love may cargo organizer.  Rather that have all my stuff slide around in the trunk of my car, I have it all right at my finger tips inside the organizer	1
Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :-	0
bag all in all is fine. the stiffners were hard to fit and two had to ne trimmed, other than that it is a fine catch all for emergency item	1
"We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great."	0
I had a check engine light problem with my car. I purchase the meter and it was able to determine the problem via the code. I was able to fix the problem with 1/4 of what the dealer charges. The meter saved me hundreds of dollars. Highly recommend it	1

"I am surprised that the other reviewer of this product actually expected the code scanner to fix the problem,  My advice?

It'll help you if you want to repair your own vehicle"	1

"Have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was ""Mr. Wizard""?  All the way down to the bad attitude?  Only to find he has a doo-dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all, like a crystal ball...

Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball.  It might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the ""Check Engine"" light has come on.  Big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see Mr. Wizard.  Sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it.

"In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)

"There's nothing worse than having that ""Service Engine Soon"" or ""Check Engine"" light come on. This scanner can give you some idea of what is going on under your car's hood. Easy to attach connector and simple navigation screens. Too bad it can't tell you how much the repairs will cost you"	1
"We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!"	0
Easy to use.  My car frequently has the CEL for engine misfires.  I took it to the dealer and they said as long as it's running OK, don't worry about it.  Now when it happens, I can clear the light myself, for free	1
This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	0
"The scanner worked fine, although it reads out a generic code.  When I went to Actron's website and signed up for ""lookups"" which go into more detail, I found what I was looking for.  It was very detailed and helpful.  However, subsequent attempts to enter the ""lookups"" at Actron's website proved frustrating, after I had paid for them"	1
"We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us"	0
"If you are a tinkerer or a professional mechanic this tool is a must have for owners of 96 or newer vehicles.

"After reading several other reviews on the web for this product, I decided to place an order for one.  I just received the unit this week and immediately hooked it up.  You should set your engine size, fuel type (gas/diesel/hybrid), units of measure, and your fuel tank size - rounded down to the nearest whole number to allow for the best accuracy in the scangauge.  It's a simple installation.  Just plug it into your vehicle's OBDII port and choose a suitable mounting location that doesn't interfere with your other gauges or present a safety hazard.  (velcro strips are included for no muss/no fuss installation, but you could devise a more permanent mount)

Depending upon the parameters that your vehicle reports, here are some of the things this device can show you:

4 sets of trip data is stored - Current Trip, Today's Trip, Previous Day, and Current Tank.  In addition, fuel economy, fuel used, maximum coolant temperature, distance, maximum rpm, drive time, maximum speed, average speed, distance to empty, time to empty, and amount of fuel to empty.

The digital gauges are for fuel economy, fuel rate, digital speedometer, tachometer, manifold pressure, battery voltage, coolant temperature, intake air temperature, engine load, ignition timing, throttle position, and open/closed loop.  You can display any choice of 4 of these digital gauges on the gauge screen at one time and it's easy to cycle through them.  Not all vehicles will report every one of the above parameters through the OBDII interface.  If the data is not available for the chosen gauge, then there will be no display.

The final thing that this gauge is useful for is to read and reset trouble codes and your ""check engine"" or ""service engine soon"" lamp.  It captures the conditions present and stores them in flash memory if a trouble code is thrown so that you can review what state the various gauges were in when the trouble code triggered.

Again, I just received this item this week, but did quite a bit of research on it before purchasing.  I am very impressed by the amount of information the ScanGauge makes available.  Utilizing the data, I believe I'll be able to improve my gas mileage, as I will have instant feedback on my inputs as a driver.  It's fun to use too.  One other thing I forgot to mention is that you can program the back-light to 63 different colors.  It comes with 7 standard colors already programmed."	1
I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one	0

I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold.

"The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least ""OK"".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!"	0
I installed this in my Mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived (which was very fast I might add).  It fit perfectly.  The height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon, so it didn't require a lot of adjusting that way.  The bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely.  I've had my three Boston Terriers back there numerous times now.  No escaping possible!  I had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this, but they were 3 times the price!  This is a great deal	1

The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys."	0
This product satisfies about 95% of what I wanted it to.  It accomplishes the purpose - keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat.  However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them.  I also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward.  Overall, this product was worth the $26 or so dollars I paid for it	1
"I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this ""bath"" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub"	0
The LifeHammer is a good product, a bit small but I have seen tests on Mythbusters (Discovery Channel) and it seems to work just fine.  I purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me.  If I could find this product in a brick and mortar store, I would have purchased it there. 	1
I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there	0
"I've never had to use this product, and don't ever want to. But it's hefty enough to do the job. Keep it in your console box or velcro it close by. Not in the glove compart where you can't reach it when needed. 
Price is right. I've ordered one for each member of my family. They say it's the best gift so far. I think that's because it's the thought that counts."	1
I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!	0
My wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car. Not only does it break the glass, it also has a seatbelt cutter.	1
"This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself"	0
After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance	1
"I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months."	0
My husband is a BMW mechanic and he drives cars all day.  I wish I could get him one for every car	1
I don not like these washes at all. The scent is very very overpowering!!!!! I had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong. I do love the case though. It is sturdy and has lots of room	0
My husband and I ordered one for all our family members for Christmas.  They all appreciated it, something people don't think to buy for themselves.  It's a good quality product, I would reccomend one for each car	1
"In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)
WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz
Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS"	0

"We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!"	0
It is good to know there is a safety tool like this on the market. Having had my mother killed in a car accident where she was trapped in her car, I have a better understanding of what might happen when you least expect it. I highly recommend this product. It is lightweight and well constructed, and the directions are easy to understand and follow. I hope everyone buys one.	1
This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	0
Although this is one item that you never want to have to actually use, I did try it on an old piece of safety glass and it worked beautifully.  I will keep this in my car at all times, and will order the key chain hammer as well for myself and my family members	1
"We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us"	0
Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture	1
"I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it."	0

Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :-	0
I don't know what this customer is talking about when he said it smells horrible... IT SMELLS LIKE A NEW CAR.  Not flowers, or fresh air, NEW CAR.  The stuff has worked great for me.

"We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great."	0
"Ozium's ""That New Car Scent"" is the closest scent to actual new car smell that I have tried. The store where I buy it no longer carries it, so I'm glad I found it here. I always get a lot of compliments from friends riding in my car that it smells great"	1
I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it.	0
For those have back pain or sciatica nerve pain, you have to try this. I didn't believe this until one of my colleague let me tried it for a few days. It makes a big difference with my situation.	1

"This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat.

We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.	0
I use this in my car while driving.  It takes pressure of your tailbone, which can reduce back pain (if you have lower back issues).  I really recommend this prodcut, both for its function and its price	1
I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one	0
"worked like a champ! I have an RV with tires that require 115 psi. this was not a problem for this compressor. The RV also has an ""air ride"" system for the axels and the 5th wheel hitch. This compressor had not problem filling the system to the required level. good pric"	1
"I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me.

What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing"	0
"this device  works awesome.  I use it all of the time since I want to make sure I'm getting the best mileage out of my tires as possible.  I recommend to  anyone who does their own ""basic"" car maintenance"	1
I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW	0
"This is one honker of a tire pressure gauge.  Good long reach for my F350 dually tires from the rubber handle dual foot valve via a flexible hose to a meter with a big display.  After one day's use, I don't see why the display doesn't always engage, but poking it onto the valve stem gets it going OK.  

Instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries.  Also not obvious how to get to the batteries, whatever they are, but I'll figure it out.  I may try another reviewer's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve.  Gotta use it a bit longer first.

Sure is a good gauge in any case"	1
Leaking, slipping, can't use over the kitchen sink. Horrible Design. 	0
I bought this tire gauge specifically to check the tire pressure of my F350 dually.  The factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical, particularly for checking the inner and outer rear tires.  Even though this gauge is sold for 'dual rear wheel trucks', I had to bend the steel tube about 5 degrees so it could make solid contact with the inner tire inflation stem.  Once it was bent, the gauge worked perfectly!  NOTE: I had friends at a machine shop bend the steel tube for me, it was too stiff to bend by hand or in a vice.  The gauge has big digits that are easy to read, even without my cheater glasses.  The air release button on the handle is convienent to use - even though I first thought it was for the display.  I have found it best to test the pressure, add more air than needed and then slowly release it using a combination of the button and disengaging and reengaging the gauge and testing until you get the desired tire pressure.  I found that if I failed to disengage and then reengage the tire pressure gauge, it tended to give me the same reading without resetting.  The guys at the garages always 'OHHHH and AHHHH' when I open the case and pull out this impressive tool.  It was well worth the money and Amazon had the best price of the various sites I visited while price shopping.  Oh, yea, I had to cut the plastic case a tad to allow for the bent tube to properly fit in the case so it would close	1
"The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least ""OK"".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!"	0
"I had used Mothers wax about 20 years ago because it very good. Well it's still a very good wax. This wax followed by a coat of ""top coat reflections"" is just amazing. Glad I'm using it again and so is my car :"	1
"WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. 

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys."	0
"I bought this product for list price in a local auto store. Expensive (Amazon much cheaper), sure, but it goes on pretty thin, so the bottle should last a while.

It was really easy to put on and remove. I used a cotton applicator to put the wax over. It hazed over immediately and just a little pressure was needed to get the wax on the car. I didn't have to rub hard or anything. I waited just a minute (probably not even necessary to wait that long) and buffed off with a good microfiber towel (the Vroom stuff from Target worked great). I really shouldn't say ""buffed"", because I didn't have to press all that hard--the wax came off with light to moderate pressure.

I found this quite a bit easier to apply than the Meg's NXT wax.

The wax looks great. It has a deeper look to it than most pure synthetics, but also has some good shine to it. My car has a darker color and it added some depth to it. I applied it to my friend's black car, and it looked pretty wet.

It does have some cleaners in it, so it removed whatever fillers I had in my last wax and exposed the swirls a little more. If you are bothered by your car's swirls, you might want to consider a carnauba wax, as it will mask them better than this one.

I've had it on my car for 2 months now and the water is still beading nicely. I doubt it will last much longer, but I think that 2 months is not bad for a half-synthetic wax like this one.

Is this the top-of-the-line best-ever wax? No, but it DOES look great, and it is easy to apply. So I recommend it to all my friends who hate spending a lot of time on waxing their car"	1
"I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this ""bath"" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub"	0
"Goes on easy, and wipes off super, amazinglyl easy, and gives a very nice finish.
I'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts, but the application was a pleasant experience.
One thing - they said it doesn't get the black trim white, but it looks like it does - the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after I applied it.  It is possible that it is from my previous wax, but I don't think so since I covered that with Mother's Back-to-Black product."	1
I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there	0
i got the car buddies frog covers for my daughter. it was a birthday present. she absolutly loved them. she is a big frog collecter. her whole dashboard is covered in frogs	1
I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!	0

"This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself"	0
I got two of these for the front seats of my Toyota SUV. They are very cute, just like the picture, but the backgrounds are a jungly green, not black, which I expected from the picture. However, the green goes great with my interior, so I'm very pleased with these seat covers	1
"I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months."	0

We ordered one, it didn't work well.  It seemed great, but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind.  based on all the reviews, we thought we must have had a defective one.  We ordered a replacement, but it seems to have the same issues.  Very disappointed. 	0
"the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of ""it took too long"" well that would be because you didn't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing...idiot.

I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it	0
I have used this item for 2 oil changes and it seems to work well.  I am concerned with the longevity of the hose connections however, I would be afraid that they could develop vacuum leaks over time since it is simply a matter of inserting the drain hose rather than a more formal type of attachment	1
"My almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller (she's tall, but still gets tired sometimes, especially if I take her shopping). I researched the options and picked the Maclaren Volo. My first stroller before it was Chicco Capri, and it always bumped against my legs, which was annoying and uncomfortable. When the canopy broke, I got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings.
The Volo seemed great - light, handsome, convenient, and highly rated by parents.
I ordered the stroller and, upon unpacking it, was quite pleased with its appearance. I read the instructions and learned to use it. The stroller seemed sturdy, well-made, and easy to maneuver, not to mention chic.
The washable seat was a good idea, I thought. I liked how large it was (perfect for an older child), and how easily it moved.
When I took the new Volo around the block, I noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly (one was higher than the other and did not rotate, which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound). Then the other set stopped rotating when one(!) pine needle got stuck in it! I had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street. Needless to say, that's not the quality I expected, since every parent I know raved about Maclaren. 
The canopy kept sliding off the rails, as well - something you would NOT want at the airport, with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow.
When I got home, I looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them, but to no avail. They were flimsy (I could dent them with my finger if I wanted to!), way too small and just poorly designed. I immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to Amazon. 
I was very disappointed. One would think that for such a high price, the wheels would be usable - after all, they are the most important feature of any stroller.
I will stay with Chicco and order a C6. At least I know that the wheels are great, and you can't beat the price"	0
"I had read about evacuators on a few forums - it works as described.  No complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts.
that said, perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve.  

The fill/drain capability looked appealing, but if you don't need to use this device to fill fluids, I would opt for the drain-only device - less moving parts, fewer things can fail"	1
I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat. 	0
The Mityvac appears to be a sturdy, well-built piece of equipment. I've used it twice and it is foolproof and fast. I really hated lying on the concrete garage floor in the past...this tool has eliminated that. 	1
"This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well.  I took it back to the store and they marked it as ""defective"".  For a few dollars more, I got the ""Healthy Care Booster Seat"" from Fisher Price.  I've had much better luck with it"	0

We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk	0
"Works well.
It operates a bit slowly but I assume that they all do.  This is not a problem and would not prevent me from purchasing it again.
A significant advantage of this unit is that the fluid can be evacuated from the unit w/o having to ""pour"" it out.  Others require opening the resevoir and pouring the fluid out.  This is useful when dealing w/ motor oil or other fluids that can be messy.
I am satisfied and would purchase it again."	1
"I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.  Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover ""material failure"". I will not buy anything else from this company.  Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous"	0
"Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally.  Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil.  My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid.  The resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum.  Still, it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it.

I also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use.  It was a real time saver on the differential since I did not have to break the gasket for the cover"	1
This product just doesn't have much variety.  My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times.  They are 5 months and 1 year.  She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids	0

"  I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too ""rough around the edges"".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it."	0
I picked up 2 of these at a local retailer. They are redesigned now with the new flat key locks, not the tumbler pen-pickable locks. Works very well on both my cars. My only concern is there is a lot of oil on the teeths so becareful on your new car	1
For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work.	0
The dual grips are kind of handy - it fits securely into place	1
Our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges wouldn't stay in place.  I love the idea, but it just didn't work for us	0
I bought this to use on a BMW motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims. It works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you can't see the readout. The readings are consistent with other gauges which I believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described	1
"I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it.
Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son."	0
"This unit works great... I bought it for my father and it works like it's supposed to. It has enough juice for a regular size CRT tv, and has been used to jump start a few times. 

The first unit i bought had a problem with the generator part and would not power anything up. I notified Amazon and in no time flat UPS was back to pick it up, and I got a new unit the next day! 

GREAT SERVICE FROM AMAZON!!! And a great product too"	1
"I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room.  I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great.  It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit.  I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel.  This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price.  I bought it yesterday and took it back today.  I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use.

"Works great,good price,fast shipping.good packaging. All is well.

We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.	0
I haven't purchased one of these, but I'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables?  Or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not.  Also, how long does it take to jump start a car? Thanks in advance	1

"hi all 
I am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me .
It has the features I wanted it to have,  and is very easy to use"	1
We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night! 	0
This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo	1
We had the Fisher Proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital.  This was the one we picked in our price range.  We had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it...until there was some weather changes.  Every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound!  Buy the sound a lights for $15 and save the extra money!! 	0
I haven't had to use it too much, thank goodness, but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind.  I did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great.  Love it	1
This monitor is awful. I have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1. It makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times, like 2 am!!! Do not buy this monitor. The onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking!!!	0
Fortunately my brother was nearby when I had a flat.  He pulled the Electromate out of his trunk hooked it up to the flat tire.  In about 20 minutes I was safely on my way to get the tire repaired.  I swore I would buy one, just in case he wasn't there next time, or worse yet, if I got stranded without help anywhere.  The jumper cables are a plus!!  I HIGHLY recommend this item to anyone	1
"After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably, I returned it. This is one of the few products I've had that truly made me ask, ""What were they thinking?"" The monitor gives off a loud ""out of range"" beep whenever it's not in good communication, and there's no way to shut it off. Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it's out of range even when it's just in the next room, and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep. But that's the least of it. The voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit, or not. This is annoying, but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room. And finally, the transmission is absolutely unintelligible: it's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound--speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor. In short, in no respect is this a functional product"	0
"This unit is even better than I had expected. I read the reviews of those who have used it and decided that it was the better of the B&D's that were also available.  A little pricier, but with the many features, it makes it worth the all-in-one package.  I was surprised it had DC plugs (for things you usually plug into the lighter).  Mostly I was looking for A/C plugs, and a jump-starting capability (for road trips, camping, etc.).  

A great deal, especially with the Amazon automotive promotion $20 off $100. "	1
This is the worst monitor! I thought being digital monitor it would be great. I was TOTALLY wrong! I couldn't even get it to work! Don't waste your $	0
Only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump. Otherwise I'm very pleased with this product.	1
This was the worst monitor we have ever had, and we have had several with our kids.  It says the range is 600 feet, but it doesn't even reach 200.  Our cordless phone reaches twice the distance.  The light makes it very annoying at night.  It beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently!  	0
This is an all around great emergency product for both car and home.  They only thing is that I wish they had the dimensions so that I could have assessed whether it would be too big or small	1
this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector. We even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor. Do not but this	0
Seems that Amazon doesn't want to sell this item because they don't tell the most important thing about it, that is that it's a 0 - 60 psi gauge to be used for tires needing about 30 psi, give or take 10.  The illustration is incorrect, but they show the same picture for all the different Moroso gauges.  I measured accuracy against a digital and it's within .5 psi.  Best thing is that it makes a perfect and instant seal with the tire.  Put a little extra air in, press the button and it's an accurate fill.  I think the rubber cover is a must.  Amazon's is the best price	1
"OKAY, FOR STARTERS, I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE. IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD. UNTIL...I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT (AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS.) WHERE TO BEGIN, THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS. WHICH MEAN, IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS! I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE. SECOND, I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION (24"", THE ONLY ONE THERE IS) BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1/2 INCHES. THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION. IT DOESNT. I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION. IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK, I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE. UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS, THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT. NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE. DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH."	0
This cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm.  It doesn't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat, so it does move around and fall forward when I get up.  Otherwise, I'm happy with it	1

"Most people agree that U-locks are one of the best ways of locking up your bicycle.  I agree with that assessment, provided that there is something strong to which to affix the lock.  Whatever you lock your bike to, it has to be at the right height and of the right shape in order to be accessible by the U-lock.  I have seen many bicyclists in the DC area use their $100 U-lock to secure their $3000 bicycle to things like street signs, wrought-iron fences, rusty pipes, and even wooden park benches.  Street sign poles, which usually have a line of holes running down them, are designed to give and break away when hit by automobiles.  A thief could easily bend and break the street sign pole to get your bike.  I recently heard from a friend that their bike had been stolen because the thief merely pulled the loose pole from its decaying cement base.  A coworker's bike was stolen when the thief lifted the bike off the top of the pole after removing the bolted-on street sign.  Wrought iron fences can be easily broken by being kicked or leveraged at the welding points.  Rusty pipes, well, need I say more?  The point is, bike racks aren't always where you need them, and you can't always find something the right size to use your U-Lock on.  At two of the job sites I ride to for my work, the only things I can lock my bicycle to are gigantic street light poles.  The New York Chain was the only truly secure way to lock up my beloved bicycle.  The versatility of the chain is the best part about this locking system.  When I do use bike racks, I just either wrap the chain a few times around the bike or the racks, or I fix the lock to links that are closer together on the chain - easily accomplished if you pull the black sleeve back.

Now for the only complaint I have about the New York chain:  It is heavy.  Really heavy.  The first ride I took with the New York chain, I just threw it in my messenger bag and strapped the bag diagonally across my chest.  The weight was so lopsided that I felt myself leaning away from the bag just to improve my balance while riding.  For the first time ever, I used the twin shoulder straps that until then had been tucked into their pocket on the messenger bag.  Even then, the weight was enough to leave red chafe marks on my shoulders that evening after my ride home.  Maybe younger riders can handle the weight, but I'm a little further on in age and it is a bit much.  If your waist is skinny enough, you can wear it on your waist like a belt.  I tried it that way and if you put the lock in the back or on your non-dominant side it isn't all that bad.  But my bicycle touring experience tells me that this is one of those items that you should really carry on the bike if at all possible.  I don't recommend the handlebars - makes the steering sluggish.  The top tube is okay, but the lock has a nasty habit of swinging into your knees as you pedal.  Eventually I had to start carrying a laptop computer around for work, so I got a luggage rack with panniers.  Throwing the chain in the panniers was definitely the easiest option.  When you're not carrying anything else in the panniers, the trunk bag is an even better place for it - the weight is higher on the bike, yes, but it is centered.

Overall, I like this lock for its versatility in locking options, allowing me to lock my bicycle to anything large and immovable.  I think this is the best way to get the highest level of Kryptonite security.  However, if bike racks were more abundant in my area, I would gladly give up the extra weight by getting a standard U-Lock"	1
"I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery.  After my delivery the bra was too small.  With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small.  I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery.  I thought they were big just before delivery.  

I decided to go w/ bravado bra.  It has worked out much better.  It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way.  The sizes are more flexable then medela.  The strap support is better then medela.

I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another.  No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding.  And breastfeeding is their main purpose"	0
"This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell.
You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive.
You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate"	1
This bra is very comfortable once on.  Getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head.  It rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body.  As far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed, which with a baby is all you usually have to work with.  The star rating is only for comfort, 0 stars for function	0
"Finally got to try this item out when my wife and I did some bar hopping a couple of weeks ago.  We delayed our drive home until the device gave us the all clear.  Of course the big question is whether the readings were accurate and without a calibrated reference device on hand, this currently remains unanswered.  Indirect evidence (our known consumption rate, body weight, and subjective feelings) suggested the device was in the ballpark.  Since I do have access to a more accurate (and far more expensive) tester at work, I may attempt some experiments and will report back the findings here.  

The device is very easy to carry around and is quite unobtrusive. Glancing at it, one would assume it is just a keyless entry.  And it is definitely at a good price point.  Since these type of devices are a great aid in being a responsible drinker of alcohol, it would likely benefit society at large if their use became common.  It should be remembered, however, that one can still be cited in most places while driving when BAC is above zero even if the levels don't reach the most serious DWI/DUI standards so having a designated driver still remains the best option.

"I like the idea of all this in one case (and it's hard to complain at this price), but some of these things would be better bought separately. We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time.  #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice.  #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little!  #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work.  #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby.  #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.)  #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less.  #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.)
Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it. If you get it for a shower gift, great; if not, you can find substitute items just as easily"	0

In this way, you can check for quality and longevity.  Put together your own kit."	0
I only had a chance to use it once so far. It's been really cold and I have had no desire to go out there and check the air pressure of my tires. The only time I used it, it worked fine. This is my 3rd air compressor for the car. The first one was stolen from my car, but it got me out of trouble a couple of times. That's why I decided to buy the second one. It's a Craftsman unit that doesn't work any good at all. So I went online and did some research and read a couple of reviews for different units and decided to go for this one. The only thing I don't like is that you loose some air from the tire when you try to unscrew the hose. You just have to put two extra PSI's	1
This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care.  The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails.  The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip.  I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering!  The case is cumbersome and of poor design.  Everytime I open it - everything falls out!	0
This is the best !!!  Best store,  best service, fast service, and great packageing.  I will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	1
"I have small hands, so I actually can't grip this product with one hand. It slips right out, because there is no hole. The items are okay, really don't like the nail cutters though, and they don't stay in there places.

Perfect for my needs.  Stores well in my saddlebags.  I saw it five dollars cheaper at Auto Zone a few days after I received it but I'm still happy with the purchase	1

The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.	0

I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods.  You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.  Don't waste your money on buying this	0
"We needed a way to haul three adult-sized bicycles from our home base to various cycling paths. So I visited a number of local stores to see what my options were. I settled on the Yakima BigHorn 4 as the best option for my budget, then discovered through some online searching that I could purchase the next model up, the Yakima KingPin 4 bike rack for a bit less than the BigHorn 4 would run me in a traditional retailer.

The KingPin 4 folds features a fold-down mast, a must convenience to allow access to a vehicle's rear hatch or door. Although I would not consider a bike rack without this feature, be forewarned: once you lower the rack while it's loaded with three bikes (more about the fourth bike claim follows), you will be hard pressed to single-handedly reposition it and slide in the lock or bolt. There is too much weight on that pivot point. 

I soon learned, therefore, that it was easier to have the mast folded up, not down, when loading the bikes. 

The dual bike arms are a must, allowing for more stability and easier loading and unloading. The bike arms fold down as well, though this option, while useful, is not essential in many cases. (These folding bike arms are the main difference between the KingPin and BigHorn racks.)

A series of bike cradles and rubber ""chainstraps"" stabilize and anchor the bikes. You can slide theses cradles along the tubular arms to allow sufficient room to avoid any rubbing or scraping if you are carrying three bikes. (I looked as some less expensive racks that required hand-tightening one or more big bolts to tighten clamps that held the bikes. That system seemed like a royal pain and huge annoyance.)
 
Despite the name and billing, I'm less confident in recommending the KingPin4 for transporting four bikes. I think it's possible, but would require great care to avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals and spokes. Plus, I prefer using four ""chainstraps"" per bike for a bit of insurance, so if you want to carry four bikes, I would recommend springing for another set of these. 

The unloaded contraption weights about 32 pounds, so it's not too heavy as you carry it from the basement or garage to install it. But be careful of the arms or you might shatter the glass in a door or an outside light. Also, you need to do a bit of assembly out of the box, so allow a good 30 minutes to set up and test the rig before using it the first time. The drawings in the instructions did not seem to match what I was actually looking at when I had everything before me on the floor, so I spent an extra few minutes considering the options. This assembly is not difficult---it's just that adage ""never do anything for the first time"" may stump one for a bit.  

I am using this rack with a two-inch hitch, and I purchased a locking pin to replace the bolt that is shipped for attaching the rack to the hitch. I also run one of the cable bike locks through the bike frames and around the spanner between the arms to add a measure of security. 

During our first foray, a 100-mile trip each way, the bikes and rack swayed just a bit from time to time, but overall, the sway was not a problem. Having a hundred extra pounds jutting up behind the rear window will change any vehicle's handling and hamper visibility through the rearview mirror, so be prepared to change your driving style as needed. 

To conclude, the KingPin 4 has performed well. We could load and unload three bikes in about five minutes, and neither the Durango or bikes were scratched during transport. But, again, I would suggest that this rack is great for three bikes, but may be a challenge for carrying four. "	1

 I use it for the air compressor.  I just wish the gauge would be easier to read the numbers are too close together and to smal	1
"This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, ""OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!"" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib"	0
"Many useful features in this design: compact but capable and rugged.  A recommended item for emergency power outages, and for general service where portable power is needed: starts dead car batteries, pumps tires, runs 120V tools, etc.

Two design shortcomings I hoped weren't there, keep it from 5 stars - #1: it charges from either a wall-wart 12V adapter, or from a 12V cigarette lighter plug.  I much prefer a direct 120V power cord connection versus the wall adapter variety.  #2 shortcoming: it doesn't have a self float-charge cycle - you must limit your charge times manually by unplugging it (battery damage if charged too long).  Ach!  Still, guess a person could attach his own float-charge unit instead of the supplied 12vdc adapter.  But heck, Wagan, design that into it, like the better powerpacks have"	1
Looked nice at the store. Thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch...until we got home and tried to use it. The head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat, the velcro is not strong enough. I would not buy this product again	0

"Since my daughter loves everything ""TINK"", and the local auto parts store didn't carry this Tinker Bell style, I decided to buy the one Amazon had. It turns out that she loves it, and it hold the CD's nice & snug too. Very well made"	1
I thought Tiny love products were good, so I bought this.  The first one I received had the water leaking out.  The second one doesn't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying.  My baby seems to like it, but it does not live up to what it advertises	0
It's great just the perfect size for the visor and I can still pop open the mirror.Easy to install with the velcro and the cd's stay in tight and easy to remove	1
I like the music, but we have to have it on auto to play.  Because I have a mirror in the seat to see my son(he is still backward facing), I can't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on.  Also, I have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim.  So just music plays.  There are plenty of other smaller items that can do that.  This thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe.  I am changing them every couple of days, and we aren't in the car much.  What a disappointment!!  Good concept, but doesn't work well at all	0
"I just got this myself and it works like a charm.  Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises.

I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4"" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed.

The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8"" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.  

Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required"	1
Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy	0
Works just as advertised, but requires a bit more light than just sticking it on the outside of the light cover. By tucking it under the cover you get a nice bright blinking dot. No batteries, no outlet, no transformer brick	1
If your baby has fingers or teeth this is NOT a trap. They can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee.	0
"A tennis ball on a string will perform the same function but this is much cooler!
Set-up was very easy although the person who wrote the instructions clearly did not have a full understanding of the subtle nuance of the English language.
The idea that the unit is solar powered (driven by the garage door opener lights) is simply brilliant. No batteries to replace, ever.
Aiming the laser was tricky in my case as both cars in the garage are jet black and my idea of beaming the laser on the car was abandoned after discovering how difficult it was to see the laser light in the black finish.
I settled for finding a spot to shine the laser (it creates a red line)on the garage wall and I would be able to drive the car forward until the line dissapeared from sight. That would then be the ideal stopping point. This worked well with only one problem I did not discover until nightime. 
Driving into the garage with the headlamps on washed out the laser marking and required that I turn off the headlamps before docking.
With all this little issues, I still think this is very handy little product and I have had no problems with the way it works. Once aimed, a little loc-tight or nail polish on the screw for the laser head mount is probably a good idea as a slight movement of the beam after you have developed a strong trust in using the laser light as a guide could potentially result in thousands of dollars of repair to home and auto.

"For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.

On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess"	0
The laser parking system works great! It took me 5 minutes to install and now my wife can park her way oversized SUV in our garage with little problem. No kidding there is 1 inch to spare in the front before she hits the shelves and 3 inches in the back so the garage door can close. With the laser she hits the mark everytime	1
It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time, he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere.  I tried it a few more times after that and got same result.  The lid is WAY too easy to remove. 	0
I bought this from Northern Tool for $9.00 and found a much better product than I expected. The 75 watt bulb in my door opener powers the Solar cell without a problem, guess Andrew got a defective unit or is trying to use this with the light guard over the bulb, It must be in direct view of the bulb. The laser points to a spot on my dash allowing for perfect parking every time.	1

Looking for an easy in-expensive parking system:  This is it.
well, I own a Ferrari and a 'two' car garage. NOTHING comes with in 3' of my-precious.....but, parking this beauty in what has now become a space shuttle simulation area, requires precise skills, of course which I have...goes without saying.   Looked at the in-floor bumpa systems but that required sticky tape and cleaning about it wasn't good.  Desired the electronic stuff but hated the thought of electricity and such and the cost of some was too high to justify:      ENTER THIS ITEM Which is pure spot-on. It uses for power, get this, your garage door's light.  There is a light activated switch that triggers the laser to fire in a blinking fashion. VERY compact, VERY easy to install, VERY small [laser is about 1.5"" long.  The solar powering of the laser works like a charm, the trigger works perfectly and NO POWER SOURCES to worry about.

"The great thing about this is that if you've ever strugged with ear-buds, or something similar you'll never have to do so again!

I have basically forgotten that these are in my helmet, the setup is seamless.  The wires fit perfectly under the padding in most helmets and the female connect is then attatched with velcro to the underside lip on the side of your helmet, so when not in use you really don't notice it.

When you need it..reach up and connect your music male connector.  Piece of cake!

The only downside is that it's not very loud at it's loudest setting with my MP3 player.  Not sure if that's a fuction of the speakers or the player.  It's loud enough to enjoy though"	1
This product is absolutely useless.  Save your money.  The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it.  In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever.  So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.  So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout	0
I recieved the Mr. Clean Auto Dry system for fathers day. Im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place, and one with the incredible claim that this product makes, that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel, well quite frankly I was very skeptical about this products claim. I used it today and was very impressed. It took about 10-15 minutes to dry but when it did, my beautiful silver car looked better than when I used a shamois. It was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes I would have spent drying the car. I am a big fan of the auto dry system, and will never towell dry again	1
I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase.	0
"Been using Mr Clean AutoDry system for a while now.  As long as the filter refill is not used up (stops deionizing the water), you'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off, allowing it to dry spot-free.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't a pressure washer, or anything other than a system.  You have to wet the vehicle, wash with the system's soap, and then rinse with normal water.  When you're ready to dry, use the filtered water, and then let dry!  Best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area, or the soap/rinse water will dry leaving spots.

The only negative I have with it is that it doesn't last very long when you've got a full-size truck and a minivan that needs washing.  After 2-3 washes of my vehicles (total, not each!) the filter doesn't deionize as well.  But sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles!  No more hand drying for me"	1
"I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that ""converts"" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is ""WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"" "	0
I own a cleaning service and was not satisfied with the current stainless steel cleaner I was using. All the other cleaners you need to buff until the streaks are gone but, with Sprayway it glides on and that is it. LOVE IT..  Nikki Madison, WI	1
I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove	0
I have been in the housekeeping business for six years. I ran out of my stainless cleaner today and used my clients. It is the best I have seen there is absolutely no effort to apply this product and the results are fantastic. Two thumbs up for sprayway stainless steel polish. You have my business from now on	1
We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept	0
I have a stainless steel table top and was very disappointed when trying to clean it with standard household cleaners. Most cleaners would only leave a dull finish and streaks. I saw this product specifically for stainless steel and tried it. The results are stunning. A light spray and quick wipe with a cotton cloth leaves a dramatic, bright and shiny surface. No rubbing, no scrubbing, no fuss. It's worth it to have this one trick pony in your cleaning arsenal	1
If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you.  Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting).  I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not.  She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well.  Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter	0

"I researched many car seats and settled on this one. Safe and cute! But it has a *major* flaw:

The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat. My daughter, only five months old, was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out. This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight, forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone. 

I asked around online on some forums, and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons. Many mothers didn't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs, but it was a problem for me already, because we use cloth diapers, so my baby's butt is bigger due to the 'padding.'

This car seat wouldn't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers... and even otherwise, I can't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so... The Britax Roundabout has the croth belt at a different location, a few inches further out from the back of the seat, so it is the one I am getting as a replacement"	0

Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.

I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it.  But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy.  After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL.  Piece of junk. 	0

I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it, it's made of soft, natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby.

I used the compressor to add air to 4 tires, approx. 5-7 psi per tire and it worked fine, didn't take too long.  However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up.  2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over.  I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor.  While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work.  I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem	1

This oil pan is great for changing your oil multiple times, depending on your  kind of car or truck.  It is easy to work with, not too large, and will help you save a lot of money on oil changes, being that doing it yourself costs around fifteen dollars, versus the fifty dollars it will cost you at a mechanic.

"When I ordered this product, I was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it. I was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it. This happiness only lasted two days before the mobile, lights, and music stopped working. I am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product. I have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby.

"The Mothers Powerball & Mini Powerball are outstanding. Recommend it to all car collectors. We just loved the way it works and the time it cuts down to polish crome wheels. Used the big ball on the pro-street wheels and the mini on the front. We'd still be polishing if it wasn't for the Mothers products.

Great buy"	1
"For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to ""customer service"" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing"	0
"I bought this for 'just in case' scenario.  It happened about three weeks after purchase.  Dead battery on my pickup.  Previously, I had followed the mfg's recommendation/instructions for a newly purchased unit and unit was fully charged.

This thing is great, I had to jump start pickup 3 times before finding out I had a defective battery and needed to replace.  It kept me from being stranded.  It is simple and foolproof to operate.  It has worked form me and sits in my garage fully charged again.  It is cheap insurance and saves having to call a friend or a tow truck for a jump start.  I wished I had purchased earlier. GOOD BYE JUMPER CABLE"	1
i got this toy for my brother , who is 4. The buttons were hard to press, the stickers didnt stick, it used many batteries, and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal. Save ur money! buy something else	0
"i just walked a mile to buy this, cause my car is dead, and i don't know anyone in this town yet.  I'm excited to have found this, but it really would be nice to have even a 3-4 inch power cord so i can use my extesion cord that has a double sided female end.

As it is though, you need an extension cord that is made for only plugging in one unit to female end, cause the blades on Instant Power are recessed in a small area. 

I'm sure this product functions well, the owner at ACE hardware told me he has one and he loves it.  It is frustrating though, to have to walk right back to the store again in freezing temperatures, just cause the product doesn't come with cord, nor say on the box that one is required but not included.

Actually, i just noticed it does say on box ""just connect an extension cord.""  But that wouldn't have prevented my hastle if i had seen that at the store.  Cause i have an extension cord, just not one with only one female connection. "	1
"I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its ""travel bag.""  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!"	0

After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it! 	0
THIS IS NOT A CHEAPO CHINESE PRODUCT. MADE VERY WELL. WORKS GREAT. VERY VERY GOOD PRICE	1
I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.	0
It's what I will need if the car battery is drained.  I hope I never have to use it	1
I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them	0
 very helpful and easy for anyone to use I no longer have to call towtrucks to start my car when my battery fails me the money it saves me is put to better us	1
I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly	0
"I've learned from my mistakes. I've purchased two of the cheaper jump starters (one Coleman, one Vector, probably made by the same folks) and both stank. They don't give enough power to do than more than a couple of cranks in warm weather, and are worse in the cold. Worst of all, the cheap plastic clamps broke. It was difficult to open them wide enough.

This charger, on the other hand, works very well, and it's a great value. Lots more power, charges up efficiently, and has solid all metal clamps. You do need an extension cord with a small enough female end to charge it, but that's easily found.

BTW, aside from the obvious uses of this product, it's nice to have the male-to-male cigarette lighter extension cord. This allows you to provide power to your vehicle when you are swapping out that dead battery that was giving your problems, which means that all the electronic settings in your vehicle are preserved during the swap"	1
If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others	0
This jump starter has the capacity to jump start diesel engines and everything else I've used it on; I only wished it came with the cigarette outlet cable that is an option...if it also had that I would have rated it with 5 stars	1
These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom.  The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff.  I lost three bags of milk due to leaks.  If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags.  They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions.  I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these. 	0
This product is great.  Now I no longer have to guess where to stop when parking.  With limited space in our garage I was always stopping to short and the garage door wouldn't close or to close and hitting the garbage cans.  Now I no longer have to guess.  Great bu	1
"The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying. 
I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy"	0
This product just arrived. I am very impressed by the quality of the material and the zipper. I have adjusted the roof rack on my FJ Cruiser and may put something in the bottom of the carrier for support- we will see if that is needed. This product is cheaper and of higher quality than those seen in department stores	1
I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag. 	0
This carrier worked well on our Honda Pilot.  It kept several large suitcases dry.  We used several large bungee cords to secure it.  The only problem was that it made noise but we taped them down.  The fabric kept them very well protected.  I would recommend it for anyone needing the extra space in their car	1
"I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest.  These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do.  These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).

Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them.  They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own.  Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease.  I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me.  Simple, clean and easy. "	0
We needed a car top carrier for a drive from Arizona to Utah.  After much research, we decided to give the Kar Pak a try.  It worked wonderfully!  We fit two suitcases, a duffle bag, and some random stuff in garbage bags on top of our minivan.  During the drive, we weathered snow, sun, and rain.  We were on the road for a total of 13 hours.  By the time we reached our destination, everything inside the Kar Pak was dry and perfect. The Kar Pak itself was easily washed off, folded up in it's box, and put into storage.  This is a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a car top carrier.  It's easy to install, doesn't budge (we checked the straps several times during the trip, they never loosened or anything), and it keeps everything inside dry if it rains or snows. 	1
I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful.  The twist-tie closure is complicated.  They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing.  I recommend the Lansinoh bags.  They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing.  You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer.  They pour great - no spills! 	0
"The carrier held 2 huge suitcases and several other duffle bags and packages.  We went thru a snow and ice storm on a 1200 mile trip to 
Orlando and there was not a drop of water inside.  I also purchased a bungee web to put over the top for the extra security and this worked out well. There was no wind noise even when traveling 75 mph.  Great item"	1
"Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOL 

My daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOL

We used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth"	0
  I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat	1
I didn't even get to use this pad. It fell apart in the washer the first time I washed it. The vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle?????? What's up with that? What good is it to have a mattress pad that you can't wash? TOtal waste of money - I am taking it back today!!	0
"I purchased this bag and drove over 1600 miles in rain and snow. The product performed wonderfully. I noticed small water droplets when I finally opened it after six days. This may have been due to opening and closing the bag to take things out during the trip.

I really have nothing negative to say about this bag. If you need a bag for your car roof, buy this one"	1
Unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber.  When I called the company (I use these cloth diapers in my business) to ask, they told me this was the same product.  It is not. They quilt and wrinkle after one washing, and just don't hold up their shape in general.  Amazon needs to update their site, because the packaging has changed as well.  I miss the old diapers!	0
I knew we needed this thing with 7 people crammed in a van, but I'm short, so I was leary. No problem. It saved our travel experience and wore very well. Easy to work with. Well worth the price, which wasn't bad to begin with	1
"The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve.  I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley
different diaper.  These are thicker, better quality and have blue stitching and ""Gerber"" stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers.  The diapers I got were thinner, plain white and had no stamp. Buyer beware!  You will not get what you see in this current photo"	0
We purchased this item to travel to the mountains for Christmas.  We drove 7 1/2 hours in the pooring rain.  Our luggage stayed completely dry.  It easily attached to our mini van luggage rack and stayed secured the duration of the trip.  This bag is awesome and reasonably priced! 	1
I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child.  They hold plenty and have held up pretty well.  the ones I havn't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years!  These aren't as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper, trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail.  these are the best diapers sold in stores	0
Our first experience with a cargo carrier was over Christmas.  We were really counting on it and things worked great.  It is very spacious, easy to pack and stores nicely	1
After trying almost every bottle, I tried these and waht a nightmare! There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back	0
This carrier is very good.  Only one draw back.  The zipper only went around on two sides.  Would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap	1
"We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well.
1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag.
2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic?
3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant"	0
It does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location.  I had to remount/move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position.  The forward/backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me	1
"I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping, since it was recommended from a friend. However it doesn't work for me. I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag. After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn't like it and tried to return it. The company would only issue store credit because I ""opened"" it. What a rip off"	0
This parking assist works as described.  Its easy to install but the laser doesn't stay on long enough and even with the car in motion the light sometimes goes off before the car comes to a stop because it doesn't detect motion on the smooth, one-color surface.  My wife can't see the light on the front of the hood because she line of view is lower than mine, however, I find it working fine	1
My baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing.  She cried everytime we put her in it.  It really does not provide a full swing motion.  She tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction	0
"This little gadget works well!  It's easy to install, the motion detector works as advertised, and most importantly, it does help us park our cars accurately in our crowded garage.  I tried other devices, but they didn't work.  
I'm glad I bought these little dealios. They've made my life infinitely better, my wife is happier, and my dog likes me again"	1
"I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the ""palm tree"" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around."	0
After reading the other reviews, I had to speak up.  I've tried it all: the garage bump, the stop light type system, etc.  You mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop.  In my case, I point it at the dash.  When I enter the garage, the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright, you can follow it as it tracks along your hood.  If you set it up right, this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall. For example, you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one. Then when it reachs the dash, I watch for it to land in a specific area and stop.  A successful park, usually with only an inch or two variance.  It so rocks	1
I got this swing And I will be talking it back. I put it on 5 and It will not move. I don't know what it would be like with the baby in it. I just tryed it. 	0
The Park Smart Mats work, that is if your're a good aim.  Really these mats need to be about twice as wide.  The mats are about a foot wide and as you are pulling up to them you can not see them because the hood of your vehicle blocks your view.  Consequently,if you're not lined up perfectly you'll drive right past them.  That being said, they're still the best non-electronic item on the market for stoping your car where you want it	1
"The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds. 

My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you"	0
"Overall, I am satisfied.  So far I have not experienced creep, but I move my car into position very very slowly, so that may help.

My one suggestion is that it could be wider.  It is easy to slide by if I am just a little off line.

I have yet to try it on my boat trailer, so that will have to be covered later"	1
"We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off. 
Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand"	0
I've used GS27 on two cars of mine that had scratches. I've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches. It really depends on the scratch and how deep it is. It works like MAGIC on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches. It works alot like a car wax as far as application/removal. You have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it doesn't completly remove all scratches.	1
"I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up. 

Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing"	0
This is a fine product. The 3 LED bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination. I ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom. I left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when I chose to shut it off. You will not be disappointed with these. Awsome	1
"The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off.

Don't confuse these with the cheap ones going around. Cheap ones have only 1 led light and no batteries. These come with  batteries and have 3 led light in each unit. I bought these for a bookshelf and curio cabinet. I have come up with 1000 more uses and ordered 12 more. You won't be disappointed. I have been looking for these for about 2 years and finally found them	1
"This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, ""Sorry, you are out of warranty"" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller"	0

I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.	0
I recived this product about a day or so before Christmas.  It was in perfect condition.  Will order from you in the future. Thanks	1
"I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.

That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing.  I only wish it were better made and more thought out. "	0
A MUST HAVE !!..Well,you can live without it,but if you don't mind spending $20-$25 bucks for a skt. holder,this is the one.Well made,versatile,and it does what its supposed to....HOLD the sockets in place.Magnets make it handy as a shirt pocket	1
"I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom. 

I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay. 

I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!"	0
"I finally had to upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old Schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working, but because it didn't have enough horsepower to handle the big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery in my boat.

This unit was priced quite a bit less than some other brands with similar capability, so I was a little afraid Schumacher, like many companies, might have gone the ""cheap"" route with their products by using a lightweight case and cheap components. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a solid, heavy, well built charger in the best Schumacher tradition. Well designed with a very stout plastic cabinet with pop-up carrying handle, informative and easy to use front panel controls, and nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget to unplug it first, plus automatic polarity protection, and a looong power cord with a handy place to store the cord. I found only a single minor negative:  If I had to change anything about this unit, I'd find a quieter fan. The fan, although it's pretty loud for it's size, is at least automatic and only runs when needed, so this is no big deal to me, since I only run it in my shop/garage. Haven't tried the ""start"" function, which I consider a more or less useless frill for a charger of this size, but it certainly charges all types of batteries like a champ, and the automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great. I highly recommend this great little charger"	1
This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born.  I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice, I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life!  I had the worst time with this bottle!  It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast.  SHe would also gag and had horrible gas! I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better.  It ended up being the same problems again!!  I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding!  My daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula!   Even though it is a little more work with the drop in system, I dont care!  I can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less!   	0
Excellent product, and the Amazon deal (free shipping and a large price drop) made it a no brainer.  The unit is a rugged, very flexible charger from a major company in the business.  The de-sulfinization (or is it de-sulfation ?) battery conditioning feature can bring back a battery you would otherwise have to replace (I've used it successfully already), and the 65 amp boost mode can start a car with a weak battery that you would otherwise have to jump (used that too.)  I'm very satisfied with this unit, it's light years ahead of anything near the price I paid that I would find at Sears ...	1
What more can I say?  These bottles leak all over the place.  I switched to Dr. Brown's, and they have been great.  No leaks, and my son spits up less.  Do not buy Avent bottles and nipples - they leak like crazy, and cause a huge mess	0

Works fast and good.  This is a great charger.  Anybody can use this.  The voltmeter and % of battery indicator is nice, I don't have to check the battery with my multi-meter.

"I was really disappointed in this ""Sealy Ultra"". It does not feel like a very good mattress. We'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better. I'd say you need to see the mattress, decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet"	0

I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store.  The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover.  The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.  The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck.  I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece.  If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great	0
This is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor.  High quality and easy to use	1
I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer	0
"After trying every wiper from the $2 ""Wally World"" variety to even the most expensive Bosch wipers, I've found performance and longevity was actually about the same throughout the spectrum of windscreen wipers I was very disappointed in how long they would last (about 2-3 months of perfect wiping). 

Before purchasing a set of the ICON wipers for my Volkswagen Golf I was about to spend a few hundred $$$ on OEM wipers ""Aero"" from the R32, which seem very similar to these. After more than six months of use I am glad to say they still perform very well and there is yet no need to replace them. I only wish Bosch would make a 13"" version for the rear window"	1
I bought this item in preparation for my first child.  I tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time, from 94.2 - 102.3!!  I returned it the next day, don't bother!	0
After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.	1
Every single time, the reading is way low - around 94.9 or something like that.  It is extremely unreliable.  Don't waste your money	0
I know, who thinks of looking for anything special when replacing your wiper blades.  Get the cheapest ones from the auto parts store and forget about it, right?  Well, if you have to deal with even the smallest amount of ice or snow, these blades are incredible.  They wipe clean and smooth every time and never clog up with ice or snow.  They sit low and tight on your windshield and don't skip or chatter at highway (or higher) speeds.  While $20 bucks each may seem like a lot, consider your safety in bad weather and how effectively these blades clean your windshield, and you'll thank yourself every time.  Buy them through amazon as they're the best deal around.  Every auto parts store that had them wanted almost twice the price	1
I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one	0
I was able to put this on myself. I really love my steering wheel cover. Will definitely want to get the other accessories	1
I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$	0
This is not only a nice Tinkerbell accessory for the car, but a quality steering wheel cover also.  The material appears as if it should hold up nicely and the graphics are nice	1
This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best	0
it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets	1
I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm.  I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice.  First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT	0
Small but reliable. It helps me to save gas and tires. Thanks for it	1
"I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!!  
  
 Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o"	0
It looks funny in the ad BUT it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure + I liked the bright colors so they don't get out of sight.	1

"I found the product to be very useful myself; wiring diagrams are better than any books I had seen and now I know why. The information here comes from Mitchell1; most of the pro technicians I know pay good money every month to use it.

It was worth it just for that and details of the ""surprise"" third fuse panel under the hood. True, some of it might be over your head, but overall I found eAutoRepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do-it-yourselfer."	1

I have a Nissan Sentra so I guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars.  I had the easiest time to put it on.  It popped right on.  It doesn't slide around either.  I bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day.  It's a beautiful steering wheel.  I got seat covers to match with it.  amazon has the best price.

I know it's supposed to be snug but the mattress won't even lay flat with this sheet on it.  It seems like it'd be a great product, if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly.  "	0
Very impressed so far. Used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly.  Never impressed with Black and Decker tools but I think they got it right this time.  Time will tell and I would have given it 5 stars if it holds up for a few years	1

I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.)	0
"You have to be very careful how you apply this product. The instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution, only then will it work.

I've loved this product since I first got some from my dad in many years ago.  Forget the car.  I use it in my bathroom!  Stepping out of a shower and being able to see in the mirror is great.  No more trying to blow dry the mirror or wiping with a towel only to leave behind wet streaks and having the mirror re-fog again.  This is the greatest. I almost thought they stopped making it because I couldn't find it in the last 2 automotive stores I visited (it came bundled with the regular Rain-X for windshields...also good) but now that I see it on-line, I know I can buy it again	1
"The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months, the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams (thus patch would not work).  Kel-Gar does not warranty the product, and the store that the tub came from (via amazon) only offered a 90 day warranty.  

Also, the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub, the rest flows behind it.  Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill"	0

We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered.  Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered.

We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day.  They said it wasn't our concern and to just give it back	0
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away).

I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it.  My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce	0
"Get yourself a can of ""photoblocker"" and this license plate or risk being victimized by some deputy do-right and his shiny new toy: the traffic camera. Rumor has it that several class-action suits are underway while others have been won against these cameras. I lost $180 in tickets to the fiefdom of Chicago before installing this system. The tinted lense covers your plate and protects you from losing your tag. My tag has been stolen once and weather took another during the past 4 years. The solution I chose was a couple of coats of photoblocker with the smoke cover lense over the top; I tried to get a polarizing sheet from 3M but they would not sell it to me because most states are making these defenses illegal. The principle of operation is simple: the photoblocker reflects back the light from the camera flash, the smoky lense deadens some of that reflection but obscures it (like a polarizing sheet)making it even harder to read than with the photoblocker alone. Also, by itself, the lense will make it a little harder to see your numbers in daylight. By law, your numbers must be visible but there is no scientific minimum so anything you can do to inconvenience the cops will benefit you. 

FYI: photoblocker works because the traffic cameras need the flash. It is all about shutter speed. To capture a clear picture of a moving object --obviously, you are racing through a stop sign-- you must have a flash. If you tried without the flash the shutter speed would be too slow to catch anything but a blur. By sending a pulse of reflected light you cause the photo to be over-exposed. One of the makers of the traffic camera says that all they have to do is re-develop the picture. Perhaps, but I seem to remember you would need to develop two pictures and put together the photos. This seems like a lot of trouble for a police department and may even require re-programming the software for their digital cameras. They probably won't bother: there are lot of people without counter-measures and the cameras costs them a fortune anyway.

"I only have the turtle and the fishing net.  
Turtle:  The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it.  I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months.  I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water.  There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle.  I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings.  I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem.

"This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word ""wrap"", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier:
1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion.
2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top.
I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them.
On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of."	0

My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux (she doesn't vomit, it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn).  She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old.  They were horrible!  We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!	0

I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design	0
"I bought this because I was moving from Boston, MA to Phoenix, AZ and driving myself and my 2 daughters.  I was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity- and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut.

It rained and snowed on our trip and luckily, we had everything already wrapped up in plastic bags - this is not a waterproof cargo bag, but rather, water *resistant*.

When we got to Phoenix, I noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed.  I think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship.

I recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip, but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving.

Good points:  Was able to fill it really well, was very easy to install
Not so good:  straps really can't be secured down and end up flapping in the win"	1
My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth.  We don't really like it.  Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe.  That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change!  (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full.  But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half.  We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child.  It wore out around the time we started potty training her.  That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one	0

"We have the All Clear Swing Gate (hardware-mounted, not pressure-mounted) installed at the top of our basement stairs. Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand.

Fortunately, enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance (just!) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs. But it was a close thing. An inch or a pound or a second either way and I -- or, god forbid, one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured. While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge, the gate itself, which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge, fell off and tumbled down the stairs.

The gate has been in place for six weeks, but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks.

"Ths is exactly what I needed. I have so many 12volt DC products I need connected at the same time and this definetly helps. I like thatI can mount it where I need to, and there is a good sized cord that comes with it.

If it goes from green to orange, start your vehicle and you won't have to worry if your battery is going to die"	1
I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose.

I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work.

"I had been looking for a new gauge, and really had my eyes on an analog dial type.  I found one surprisingly hard to find at local stores, so I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon, and at a really decent price.

This Accu-gage model is simply great.  Solid construction and finish.  It's the perfect size.  Perhaps the best feature is the release valve function, which holds the acquired pressure reading from your tyre, until you press the little thumb button to release the air pressure from the gauge.

First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it.

"Buy anything.  Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result.  I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible.  I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!!  So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying ""HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls!  I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains.  This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online.  I feel like throwing a party when it gets here.  I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house. "	0

We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars.  It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc.  We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid.  Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model.  WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER.  As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it.  I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model.  This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it.  HORRIBLE	0
I've used design tech products fo over 5 years and probably put at least 5 in my family cars. The only problem is there tech support isn't what it used to to be. There is one company that took over most of the remote starters and the tech help isn't as good. I tried a bulldog for my son's wife's car and the quality isn't near Design tech. I've had them in vehiciles over 5 years or more without few problems. Caution if you installing on some of todays cars you need to purchase other products to get around the security systems. You still need a key to steal the car or a professional thief. An electrical back ground is needed to install this product. They have a good color chart for wiring. Frank Nielse	1
This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs	0
I installed this item on my 2001 Dodge truck shortly after I purchased my truck in Nov. 2000.  I have not had any problems with the unit at all.  My key fob has worn out, though it has seen some abuse.  I installed the unit myself using their instructions.  The install did take longer than I anticipated, but mostly because it sometimes took a bit to find the correct wire in the truck.  In all, it has great features at a fair price	1
My baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor.  Please use caution with this toy!  The toy wasn't being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted.  There was no reason for the toy to fall apart	0
"I have a 2005 Ford Ranger.  I bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install.  After that I began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit.  I went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout.  
The unit installed well, worked fine after initialization.  Came with a video that really helped in the installation.  I find the range on this unit to be super.
I have no complaints"	1
This cute turtle was terrific for about a week.  My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options.  Unfortunately, the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use.  I was the one pressing the button when it came off, and I wasn't being rough or using excessive force.  We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily.  For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle, but then the rubber sensor fell off as well.  With no way to turn the thing on, we threw it away.  My toddler was sooooo sad, but it was worthless to us.  Since this is overall a popular product, I suppose we just had bad luck.  I wouldn't buy another one, though	0
"I have read down thru the reviews and I would like to point out some issues I have with some low scores.. 

First, why would someone give a low score to something they purchased knowing it had the least features of any other units.  The ratings are about the unit in question. 

Second, if you read the code, then start throwing parts at your car having no mechanical knowledge, don't come here and start complaining that this unit didn't do your dishes for you too. 

This is an inexpensive tool that will allow you to get the information from you car, and can also clear a CEL, 'Check Engine Light' that was set off because of a DTC, 'Diagnostic Trouble Code.'  I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it does, does it well, and is well built.  No E-bay garbage here.    It will not, however, give you a mechanics point of view.  That is training that you will need to buy from elsewhere ;-"	1
I bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it DOESN'T FIT AT ALL! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don't get it for travel as it doesn't work for that	0
This unit does exactly what it says.  Reads the codes and allows you to reset the Check Engine light.  It also has software to intrepret the codes, but this is very basic in nature and you can find the same info on the internet or from some car mnufacturers.  The unit is very well built and easy to operate. 	1

My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping.

"There are more expensive units out there and they might be appropriate for you if you need more information.  But this one is perfect for what I need.

I had ""Check Engine"" lights on both my 2000 Accord and 2005 Camry.  I wanted to find out what the problems were so I could decide if it was something that needed immediate attention and to find out if it was something I could fix myself.

It found the problems on both cars within a couple of minutes and reset the errors.  The Honda had a ""proprietary"" error so I installed the database software (extremely easy to install) and looked it up (extremely easy to use).

Turns out both cars had non-critical problems and I could just reset the errors.  This would have cost me $150 at my car maintenance shop.

This device also functions as a pollution control system diagnostic tool.  I haven't tried that yet but it will be interesting to see how that works.

I would highly recommend this for the ""casual"" user.  Pros would probably need something that does more stuff, but this will be extremely useful for shade-tree mechanics"	1
Not good for larger houses. Ours picks up radio signals sometimes	0
"I purchased this PocketScan to diagnose my engine light, and it does work.
Once it picks up the code, you can then repair. Saves money compared to paying a mechanic to do it and charge loads of money, and it can erase the check engine light once the item is fixed. Its basic, but what more do you need. Also easy to use"	1
  We went through three of these before we finally gave up.  Our poor baby was crying and we didn't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night.  I luckily am a light sleeper.  Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near.  We bought a cheaper,  safety first brand and have not had any problems	0
Don't bother with the more expensive units that display the explanations of the codes.  This is all you need.

We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first, however after about 2 months the 1st receiver, (it came with two), just suddenly stoped working! I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen, but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working! There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we're not the only family having problems. Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model	0

"The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs. my daughter is only 27lbs. and it could not hold her. While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not. After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier. I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs. I love it. 
Also, the cross terrain claim to "" Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent's shoulder and onto hips"" it does not. I was in horrible pain after about an hour. in both my upper and lower back. I suggest you don't waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and  Kelty. 
This will work for a smaller child, but only if you can compfortably carry the weight. I did like the easily adjustable seat and back. I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands."	0
This is a great product for mirrors and windows!  Love it so much I buy in bulk.  And the delivery was fast	1
I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product.	0
"I'm a little surprised by the bad reviews.  I have used mine for years though I did wear one out after about 80 uses airing up four large truck tires from 12 psi to 35 psi through a 150psi, 2.5 gal tank.  

I have it hard-mounted in my Jeep.  It pressurizes an air tank which is connected to chucks at both ends of the Jeep.  I start the compressor near the end of the trail and by the time we stop the air tank is at full pressure.  Then I connect a hose to one of the air chucks and start airing up tires.  

The compressor runs into the tank and the tank feeds the hose.  I can usually air one tire up in about 30 seconds this way.  The compressor doesn't catch up with this makes it much easier to work - everything is up out of the way and all I have to manage is the hose.  In between tires I can stop to talk and let the compressor fill the tank again.  Or I can air up the next tire.

This unit will not last forever and does not like to be handled roughly.  I have only handled the plug once - to plug it in when I bolted it to the Jeep permanently.  So I don't have the plug problems.

It is noisy but it is the sound you want to hear when you need air.  I remember one night helping a friend who had a flat. They were very grateful to hear that sound and see their tire come back to life.

If you want an industrial strength unit, you are going to have to spend several hundred dollars.  This unit keeps up well with an ARB compressor that costs four times as much.  Treat it well and it will treat you well"	1
This product is great but do NOT buy it from BP Medical.  You cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund - they charge a 15% restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase	0
I have never had a problem with it at all. I take it on Jeep trips to air 33x12.50x15s back up after dropping the pressure to make the Jeep go in the sand better.  That unit that won't go past 15 lbs pressure surely has a problem. Just last night I aired up four trailer tires to 80 lbs each. Seems like the farther you push the fitting on the valve stem, the faster it will fill the tire. I like mine a lot.	1
We also ordered the bedding and got the pillow. We called Baby Age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding. They should know there's a problem by now and change this listing	0
"Okay, it is only the second portable air pump we have owned, but it far outlasted the first one! I suppose everyone's experiences are going to vary. We bought our ""Truck Air"" compressor in '98 for our three week road trip to Alaska (from Arizona!). After it died at the end of this past year, I figure we got more than our money's worth from it (BTW, I intend to buy the same one to replace it!). Seven years of topping off our cars' tires and helping others with roadside flats, filling basket balls and footballs, repeated fillings of a five gallon air tank (to 100psi!!) has proven to me that it has staying power. Not sure what to say about the negative comments on this site about the pump. No problems with ours at all (no ""hot plug,"" plenty of psi, valve clamp always worked well, built in guage accurate to within 3 pounds, more than enough wiring to reach from the cigarette lighter to each of the four tires on our Tahoe)until I just ""wore it out""! The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a bit noisy - about as noisy as one of those ""pay for air"" compressors, but as I said, I still intend to purchase an identical unit, after a shop a bit for the best price. Oh, and another important point, it is ""Made in the USA!"	1
Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review.  They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set.  I have to send it back and they will give a refund.  What a hassle	0
"this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats:
1. you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery.the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting. this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery. 
your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you. also, it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire. it is a bit slow.
2. you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down. the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running. i liked it for what it is"	1

"I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.   

I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.

I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.    

I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase. "	0

"I got this scanner and am initially pleased with the capabilities of it as a diagnostic tool. There are, however, some things you need to be aware of. Some of the advanced monitoring functions do not work on all cars. For example, the vehicle identification data does not work for pre-2000 vehicles (but then, I did not need that function anyway). I was able to pull the DTC's from my car, see what it meant (I had one DTC that turned on the CEL), then I was able to read what the sensors were seeing at the time of failure, as well as a great deal of engine data from the ""Freeze Frame Data"" function. The live sensor data function works partially for my car, again, this is a function that may not work on older cars. The advertisement leads one to believe that this will work for all cars - be aware of this. It can print the results using the USB cable that comes with the unit. The printing function can be enhanced by copying the displayed data into the clipboard and pasting it into an editor program (like Notepad). I found this to be a better way to print the results. The software on the CD is VERY basic - not much help with the codes. There is a LOT more data available on the internet.

The tool is easy to use and easily connects to and from different cars. Some of the advanced diagnostic data that it will capture is not easily understood unless you get some detailed instructions from the car manufacturer. There is a good wikipedia with the PID codes for those who want more information to go through (look up OBD-II PIDS)."	1
"We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit.  She's had gas and discomfort with all of them.  I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas.  But they leak horribly.  Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.  

A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.  

I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience. "	0

Here's what I like about it.  It sprays on smoothly and gets off the surface dirt.  (You know, the green pollen that is falling on my new car this time of year?)  It wipes off easily with a paper towel or terrycloth. Also, it leaves the car smelling great.  

It is only used on the car's exterior.  For the rest of the car there is a whole line of Meguiar's products.  I also bought the leather cleaner and car shampoo which I will review later.

"I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product.  With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem.  We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples.  However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.  

The leak is not just a spot here or there.  It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap.  I know many people who have had the same problem.

For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.

"I purchased this product because my wife's 1997 Honda Accord's ""Check Engine"" light had come on.  It turned out to be an O2 sensor that was bad.

I only paid $95.00 for this product and I can get the same O2 sensor for $150.00 online.  I saved money the first time I used it and the tool paid for itself.

In addition, I can use it for any of my friend's and family's vehicles.

"When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly ""double checking"" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation"	0

Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their ""holes"" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big ""footprint"". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table"	0
"Bought this, spent 15 minutes studying the manual, plugged it in, and it worked first time -- read out the ""check engine"" code, and, when later plugged into a PC, allowed the details to be printed in a nice report.  

The only negative I've noticed is that when you reset the ""check engine"" code in the car's computer, it erases the reader's memory of it, so you have to do the PC printout before resetting the code.

Some folks believe that if you use a device like this on one car it's ""locked in"" to that car and can't be used on a different car.  This is not true -- I've used it on several different cars with no problems"	1
My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	0
Tool is very easy to use. Just plug it into your OBDII connector, turn the key and watch it record the fault codes. Then plug it into the USB port of your computer and your done. Software is intuitive and defines all codes captured by the unit and then allows you to create a printout. One use and it's paid for when compared to the hassle and expense of taking the car to the shop. Also prevents fraud since you can tell the shop what is wrong.	1
"Shoppers beware:
The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders:
1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled.
2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out.
3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them "	0
This item is easy to use, the codes were easy to read and could be transferred to one's PC via the usb cable provided.  I do not have much experience with other code readers but can't imagine one easier to operate and erase faults with than this one.  For the price I could not be happier.  My only negative comment was with the PC software.  It did not allow for saving the list of codes downloaded from the reader.  In other words if I wanted to keep this info for future reference I would have to print it out.  A minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product	1
I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.  	0
"I am a professional Technician.  This little handy dandy tool is fast, easy, and gets to the point of the problem with little to no issues.

We bought this car seat (and the snap 'n go) based on good reviews (not the ones listed here). It did not meet our expectations. I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it. Otherwise, I have a hard time finding positive things to say. It is way too heavy. Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days, it was heavy to carry around. Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months, it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time. The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work. On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop. When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend. I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn't need the support in the grocery cart---that is really the only reason I still use it	0
"This product was very easy to figure out and use.
I found my problem code and reset it with no trouble whatsoever.
A very complete manual with a good amount of background material to explain the whole OBD code topic"	1
My husband and I recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy. The noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby.  We were greatly disappointed	0
The code reader is a very good device with an excellent price. I fix my car and I saved money. The diagnostic for a car is almost 80 dollars in the auto repair shop, with that money I bought my own code reader	1
We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy	0
Used this tool on 2001 Odyssey. Gave me the code and fixed the problem. It was EGR related. Took it for emission inspection and passed. Used it also on my 2003 Mitsubishi Montero Sport. Also used to check my relatives and friends car.  	1
We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves	0
"I have been using this cleaner since my brother worked for a car-detailer about 10 years ago and ""discovered"" it.  It is the BEST for glass - truly streak-free.  It is awesome on stainless steel, tile, painted wood, sealed/varnished wood, porcelain and more - I use it for everything.  I'm showing a house right now, and this stuff is perfect for keeping things sparkling with minimum effort (though you should SEE my paper towel budget - lol"	1
"We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate.

I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them."	0
I was very upset to see a dent the size of a softball on the hood of my new BMW. The dent itself was not all that noticeable, but nonetheless an eye sore for me. After reading very mixed reviews about the Ding King, I had my doubts whether or not it would be effective. I was also very afraid that it would compound the damage. Because of the outrageously low price point, I took a gamble. I'm glad that I did. After three pops, my dent was gone. The process around using the product was simple, though a tad time consuming. I highly recommend this product to anyone with minor dents in their vehicle. I'm not sure if it'll work for everyone, but it worked for me. At $20, you can't go wrong	1
I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look.  I brought it home, put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds.  I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds.  I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music.  I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great.  It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable	0
"I had a small but noticeable dent in the fender and I wanted a cheap way to mostly fix it before committing to a full body shop. Dent King can do some jobs, but not all. For what it does, it's a pretty good product. If you fall into the category where it can help, it's worth it.

It's a ""do it yourself"" dent repair kit for your car. It ""pulls"" dents back out and is a fairly good solution for dents that ONLY require pulling ""back out"". This includes door and shopping cart dings you'd get in a parking lot. It has to be minor, no larger than a grapefruit, and only cosmetic dent damage to a metal panel where there is NO crease. It does not address scratches.

The ideal dent for the Dent King to repair is damage from a blunt object, like a rounded plastic corner of a shopping car dinged the middle of your door and left an indentation that is small, did not cause creases, not on a crease.

I think this is but one tool of an arsenal of tools that body shops use. That means, it is only applicable to a specific type of damage. If the dent looks like it just needs to be ""sucked back out a bit"", then the Dent King probably can help.

Clean the surface with the included cleaner, which smells like regular rubbing alcohol. Use the supplied glue gun and special glue sticks and dab the melted glue onto the end of the ""puller"" stick and adhere to the dent where you want to pull it. Allow it to cool, then straddle the ""puller stick"" with the 2 point brace/bridge, and screw on the tightener to the puller stick. This will pull on the dent via the stick until the glue pops off. This action ""snaps"" the dent out a bit; depending upon how much force the glue was able to supply. This relies on a good paint job (OEM), as it's essentially pulling on the surface of the paint.

It ends up you will need to do this multiple times to slowly work out the dent

I can still see my dents but they are greatly reduced; that is, for the ones that the Dent King could be applied to. I don't think ""good as new"" will ever be achieved with Dent King, but it definitely can reduce ""ugly ding"" to ""little annoying ding"".

This is one of those products that is just a tool, and really is more dependent upon the skill of the operator. For the price paid, it delivered  value for its cost. But that's it"	1
"I had purchased the Dr. Brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness.  They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most.  By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else. 

At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks - 
*using only all dry parts for each new bottle
*not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside
*not overfilling

After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides!  Finally, the answer to the leaks!!!  

Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun.  These items were meant for baby use, and for the price  it should help make babies' & mom's life easier.

Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners.  Thank you & Good Luck"	0
These seatcovers are great! My car is a funny color, and it was hard to find something to coordinate with. The fit is perfect! Definately something you want for a change of pace	1
We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time	0
I WAS PLEASED TO FIND THIS ITEM AT AMAZON. I PURCHASE THE IDENTICAL PRODUCT AT A WELL-KNOWN NATIONAL CHAIN B/C I WANTED TO PROTECT AT LEAST THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF MY VEHICLE.  I LIKED IT AND LATER DECIDED TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON. THE ITEM CAME SECURELY PACKAGED AND THE QUALITY IS THE SAME AS THE ONE PURCHASED IN THE STORE.  THE GECKO DESIGN REALLY IS QUITE CUTE, IF YOU'RE INTO CUTE THAT IS, AND I FIND THESE COVERS QUITE ADEQUATE AT PROLONGING THE SEATS OF MY CAR.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM	1
I recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back. They say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not that well fitted. They are paper thin. Apparently Graco hasn't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality! I purchased the Koala portable sheets which were cheaper, thicker, and truly are fitted with elastic! Don't waste your money on these	0
I bought this to polish the aluminum wheels in my 85 Celica. It works so good and it is so easy to use I have been polishing lots of other stuff just for the fun of it and the results area great	1
We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both.  The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package.  After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse.  It has strings hanging all over it.  It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible! A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality)	0
"We love our Lund Tri Fold Ramp! It's a Great Product at a Great Price! 

It's very strong, yet lightweight enough, that one person can handle it. We wanted a ramp that was one piece for stability. Its solid design offers good traction along with worry free loading of all items. No worrying about anything slipping through,....like it could with an open ladder type ramp. The anti slip rubber pads and safety straps make it very secure. The longer length provides a more gradual incline than standard ramps. This adds to their versatility around the home. They're so handy for moving items.....even up and down stair"	1
I washed the cover for the first time and it didn't hold up.  The ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band  attaches to the terry.  Also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else I washed with it.  I'm extremely disappointed with this product	0
"This ramp set is just one heck of an item. traction is great and if wanted each of the three ramps can be used alone or all held together by an easily removable rubber hinge system. I like the ramp because it can be used with small wheel products like a lawn mower, track machines like a snow thrower, or even as a great loading platform for my Road King motorcycle. I recommend that the 77"" length set be purchased if you can store them easily because of the hinged attach platform to the vehicle and easier load angle. Enjoy!!"	1
I loved the gate. So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate, I needed the extension. It was well worth it. My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it, and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway. I am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall. This gate was a great purchase	0
I purchased the TINK decal along with a several other Tinkerbell car accessories for my daughter's first car. The decal is so cute. I received the decal in record time and paid no shipping! The price on Amazon was great!	1
An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	0
This is the only snow removal tool you need to have in your car. Very lightweight, compact and durable.  Won't damage or scratch your paint, and reaches the highest SUV. Wouldn't be without it.	1
"When your infant is crying because he's hungry and you're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed, you will not necessarily hear the very quiet ""click"" another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit.  Did it already cycle through once?  Twice?  I don't know.  I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out.  Yes, it was in plain sight, but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time.   
What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there, reagrdless of it being 4oz. or 8oz., makes the formula very HOT. Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions.  Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby. 
This went in the trash.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil.  Otherwise, I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem"	0
Love it.  It's effective especially when it snows a lot.  I like that it's so lightweight, makes other snow brushes seem heavy and clumsy	1
I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one	0
Used one for several years.  Saves the paint on your vehicle and removes a lot of snow with one swipe	1
"I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did. 

Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.

One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.

I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub. "	0
Haven't used product yet but I'm glad to have it for next year	1
"This tub is a waste of money.  I bought it this evening and I'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning.  Water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery, unsafe floor.  

Very unsatisfied with this product"	0
This worked very well in the record setting East Coast snow we just had. The long handle reaches all the way across my mini-van. Didn't mark up my car the way our old snow brush would. Great item! If snow is making your day sad, Sno-brum will make you glad	1
"For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items.  This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work.  We were wrong.

The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners.  The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates.  Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together.  My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.   
The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled.  Never tried it again.  If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.  

Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again.  Granted it might work for some, but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub. "	0
I finally got a Snow Brum after living in the northeast my whole life.  I can't believe I've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush.  And this is a required tool if you have an SUV and hate having 50 pounds of snow slide down your wind shield when ever you hit the brakes.  You can clean off your entire car in about 1/10th of the time.  And this is great for the deep snows too.  In short, if you have snow - YOU NEED THIS	1
"This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc.

However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue"	0
I've lived in Oregon, Colorado and now the Northeast, and seen my fair share of snow. I got one of these from a friend two winters ago, and it's the best tool for snow removal I've used. I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year. I'm buying one for some Florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year	1
At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them	0
This is a great product.  My neighbor got one and I've been trying to find them in the stores to no avail.  All it is is a sturdy plastic platform, mounted pependicularly to the pole.  You use it to push snow off your car as opposed to brushing it off.  It's much easier to use than a brush because you push rather than sweep.  I'm buyingit	1
"First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on?  Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick.  I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick.  Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things?  They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid.  Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long.  Give me the regular bottles any day.  
PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield!  I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there"	0
"My dad also bought this wax based on the ratings in Consumer Reports.  As others have mentioned, the CR review was right on.  

It went on smoothly and has a pleasant scent.  It took a little more effort to buff out, but it was easy to remove from any black plastic/rubber trim.  Although streaking was more than usual, the shine was amazing!  

Three months of parking outside in the sun and some rain, and the paint still shines and feels like there is still wax on it.  

Highly recommended."	1
"Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting.
We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement.
There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up!
It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat.

After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)"	0
"I am the type of person who only waxes our cars twice a year (I figure that's better than nothing). I want a wax that is easy to apply and provides lasting protection (mostly because I won't be applying it again for six months).

I used Black Magic a couple of months ago on our cars and I am thrilled with the results.

It was the easiest wax I have ever applied. 

And, two months later, both cars are still slippery as snot (I couldn't think of a better description). Dirt and grime wash off easily and reveal the great shine that I saw the day I applied the wax.

I highly recommend this wax"	1
I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old.  I could barely zip it around b/c it is so small.  I keep checking the tags to make sure I got the right size and not the infant one.  I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem.  It's a great product for smaller children	0
"With all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles, the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate. So ""waxing"" is still important. I recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection.
I have been following Cosumers Reports recommedations. Three years ago, their recommendation was NuFinish liquid. This year, CR recommneds Black Magic Liquid Automobile Polish. 
The liquids are easy to apply, and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes.
In my opinion the Black Magic is at least as good as the rest. I like the cherry scent."	1

Excellent product for the price....use a pre-wax cleaner 1st (Mother's #1)& then apply....goes on easily but do not let it dry too long before buffing it in; leaves a nice deep glossy shine...I've put 2 coats on so far this year & the car looks great	1
Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out.

"We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them. Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway. After only 5 or 6 uses however, the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago. 

I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem, but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product. They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase (and you have to have proof of purchase). They did offer to send me out a replacement part, but under the circumstances, I don't feel comfortable using the seat at all, so I'll be destroying and disposing of it. I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat, but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem. 

Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash, or my son certainly would have been seriously injured. We haven't had any problems yet with the other seat, but I'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe. After their horrible customer service, I won't be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again."	0

I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better	0
You can clean any kind of metal with this product.  I think you should buy it.  For the most part it's like copper and silver polish, only it's intended for metal.  Sometimes it may leave a few streaks here and there if you don't wipe the surface of the metal entirely.  If that happens, apply a touch of water and continue rubbing until the streaks go away	1
"We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.

We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it ""air out"" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.

We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product"	0
I purchased these covers for my '77 Toyota FJ40.  They fit the truck seats and made a big difference in it's looks.  They seem to be made well and will service my purposes until I can have the seats recovered.	1
Well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it, so she decided not to sell it to me.   So I never got this car seat. I really don't understand why I need to write a review on it	0
the wires arent that long, so youll need to get some longer ones. and getting the speaker wire through the firewall is  a hassle, but after you get it set up its worth it. its very loud	1
After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats, I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit. The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it. No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey, I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort. For now, I'm sticking with the Britax	0
"This thing is lots of fun. I like driving through the crowded parts of down town Atlanta and putting the loudspeaker on the sound of the frog croaking. Also, I like rolling up on crack heads and flipping on the police siren for a second.....that's funny. 
The bad thing is that the wiring is not very long to connect the speaker to the box, so you are limited to where you can install the thing"	1
"In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving? 

Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January.

The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there. 

It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us ""That should be in there real good, now."" We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, ""Oh they all do that, that's normal.""
Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it. 

Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car. 

Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1"" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard.

Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation.

Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more."	0
This Product is awesome. The other review says that it's not loud which is false it is extremely loud and if installed by a Automotive Electrician or someone who has some experience in car electrics this product works beyond expectations. This is a must for any car owner	1
I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car.  I thought the lights and music would distract him.  After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry.  It is far less irritating.  The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work.  What genius engineered that?  Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money!!	0
"I love my new seat cover. It was very easy to install over my seats.
Nice product"	1
I bought this product as I was going on a long trip.  I put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work.  I put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work.  All that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you couldn't even turn it off without taking out the batteries.  WASTE OF MONEY!	0

"CONS
*WON'T STAY IN PLACE
I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck.
*WHY A REMOTE?
Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride? 
*THE IRRITATING SONG 
too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting)
*LEARN WHAT?
I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car...

Product seemed good, got is as a gift for my mother but she decided to get a different color. The item was actually nice though.	1
These are a complete waste of money.  The nipples flow too fast for a newborn.  I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding.  She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours.  The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space	0
I bought these a couple years ago to hide my ugly bucket seats.  They feel very soft and look great.  Since they fit snugly it is helpful to have some help when installing them.  They do attract hair, etc. so they do have to be periodically cleaned	1
"Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.
They also flow too fast for newborns"	0

I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.	0
Good quality, gets the job done and sure beats the price at the Jeep Website	1
I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!	0
I like the multi-position feature of this product.  It doesn't get in the way by sticking straight out of the dash and you don't have to unplug everything to access what it's turned in front of. 	1
"This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious. I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back. It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders. Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight. Don't waste the money I would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer. 

The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci's, keys, money and cell."	0
This is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney. It could last longer and attract less dirt though. Amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free	1
"I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.

When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. 

So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore"	0
AWESOME!!! This product is wonderful. Take if from me I have been detailing for years and this exceeded my expectations. To be applied over any wax or sealant will not haze when applied and is extremely easy to buff off. Requires minimal effort at all it's like running a microfiber towel over your car it's that easy. I found that it works the best when applied over Liquid Glass which is a polish that carries a lifetime warranty on their product. You can find Liquid Glass at your nearest automotive store or at a local Autozone. I will keep on buying this product as long as they make it. Mothers recommends using their Reflections carnauba wax before the top coat which I am sure is great I have yet to do this since I love the Liquid Glass so much. The appearance of your car will change dramatically especially if you have a dark car. I recommend before you apply this product make sure that the vehicle has been clayed to remove any contaminates before applying the topcoat. Hope this review has helped you in deciding whether this is a great product or not.	1
I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months.  In 2005, I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places.  It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile, BUT... the trapdoors have broken TWICE.  I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement.  That free replacement broke less than 6 months later.  You can't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken!  This week, I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is $10.  I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke.  Unfortunately, it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so. I am an engineer and I don't know what to say, except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable.  Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system, instead of relying on $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle!  Now I have to decide whether to spend $10 on another replacement, try to fix it myself, get a different pail or maybe none of the above.  At what point is enough, enough?	0
Excellent little assortment of parts here.  It's not for everyone, but for those who can take advantage of it, it's a nice ensemble.  All the hardware is of decent quality and appears durable.  Many of the parts would be hard to get for half the price.  I bought it at a discount price and really had very little trouble seeing high value in it.  Even at the regular price, you would be hard pressed to duplicate it for double.	1
"I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).

However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient.

The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two ""trap doors"" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these ""trap doors"" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing.

Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer.

Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape.

Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner.

Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better"	0
Here's the deal, I was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly.  The filter on my son's car is on the side of the engine block (Nissan 240SX) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top.  Every time I remove the filter, the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame (a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps, but not always), then I've got oil draining from the frame for the next week, making a mess all over the driveway.  Anyway, the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique, but not what I bought the kit for (I only used the filter relocator).  Was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would.  The big plus though.....  it's about one third the cost of any other kit out there (including those listed on Amazon.com)and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car.  Been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner....... in fact decided to buy another kit from Amazon for my own car	1
"We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived.  We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive.  We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee.  Don't buy it.  The guarantee or the pail!
It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it.  We have kept it in the garage, and also outside.  Not convenient.  Refills are expensive.  And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing???"	0
"This product was very easy to install for the average do-it-yourselfer!  It took a little over 1/2 an hour when I was doing my oil change.  All of the needed components were in the box and the instructions were pretty clear.  I was a little skeptical at first about whether it was getting all of the oil out of the crankcase, so I pulled the drain plug on my next oil change once the pump was done just to verify.... all that was left coming out was a minor drip!  Overall a super value for the money and it sure has saved me time and kept me from having to clean up more ""oil change messes"".  Buy it; you'll be glad you did"	1
I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink.  But that's not how it works.  It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat!  The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times.  Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby.  I am returning this item	0
I recently bought one of these to put in my wife's car. The kit is pretty complete and well organized; you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but I liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor. The bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it won't slide all over a carpeted area.	1
I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket.  After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead.  Boy, was that a bad decision.  We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds!  Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket.  I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier	0

We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby.

Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke.  Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place.  We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use.  Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs.

a very decent soap for the price and qty delivered.  I have used soaps where the suds will last longer and form with less water, so I give it a 4 rating.  To be fair, any better soap will cost the same amount and will give you about 1/4 the amount, so I can live with re-sudsin	1
Please spend your money on a different gate.  There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate.  We have twin girls in a bi-level house.  A stair gate is a must.  The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days.  Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn.  I will say - when it worked, it was nice.  But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again.  Shame on me for buying it again.  It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use.  I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere.  If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design.  Again, please look elsewhere	0

This is my favorite wash to use on my car. It suds extremely well, holds the suds well, and the smell of it is quite pleasant. I was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes, leaving you with a bucket of dirty water. Obviously not too good for your car! With Meguiar's NXT, everytime I finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles. I highly recommend this product	1
This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash	0
I just used this product to wash my car and it worked great. As it is advertised, a little goes a long ways (1 oz per gallon). The suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy. It is also easy to rinse off. And after washing, my car's surface felt slick as well	1

The price at Amazon was more than $5 less than my local Target store.  The wax is a liqht liquid that's not only easy to apply but easy to remove as well.  I was able to wax my Mercedes convertible in about 30 minutes.  For best results, I would use a microfiber towel to remove the wax and for a final polishing.  The shine is incredible and it leaves the paint feeling silky smooth.  Although it's only been a month since I waxed my car, after 4 washings it still looks great.  This is certainly the best wax I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product	1
The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help.  Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal.  It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in.  The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it.  The worst part was getting her out.  The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position.  I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all.  I'll be donating the swing	0
Meguiar's NXT Tech wax is easier to use than any other wax I've ever used, and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red Honda like no other as well.Buy it, use it, love it	1
We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!	0
I'm so used to using Zymol, I just wanted to try something else.  So I purchased this stuff, and first off, it makes any car bling like crazy in any type of lighting.  Second, if it rains, the wax stays bling and the drops just roll right off of the car for the first couple of times it rains, then you're outta luck.  But if you live in an area that doesn't rain too much, you can practically not wash your car for a LONG time and just whipe your car down with a microfiber cloth and it'll be just as bling as it was when you first put it on.  For application, you don't need a buffer to make it look really nice because it comes off really easily with a terry cloth	1
I should have read the reviews.  I purchased this item, and it quit working after a week of normal use	0
I am a proffessional car detailer and have used many waxes through my 40 year career. Meguiar's NXT Tech is by far the best wax I have ever used. It leaves a tremendous deep shine and gloss. Keep in mind it is a wax, so it is essential for the best results to use a cleaner polish before applying the NXT. If the surface is clean you could get by with just the wax. I find that it lasts a long time in fact on one of our cars it lasted an entire year and the car sits outside. The key of course is to wash often, once a week is preferable. It leaves minimal residue which can easily be dealt with using a soft tooth brush to get out the excess wax. Every year I strip the wax off our cars and reapply polish and the wax. My 2000 still looks brand new and our other cars as well. I am sold on this product. Give it try and see for yourself. It also smells nice	1
I have this and have used it for about 5 months. I have never had problems with it starting, but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation. I am looking for a new sterilizer because of this. I do not recommend.	0
If you want a deep gloss, a smooth finish, and paint protection, then you will love the NXT. But be advised, the NXT paste, is a better product than the liquid. They both give the same look, but the paste seems to last longer, because liquid have more solvants in them. The paste is not hard to use at all, and the secret is to ues a very Small amount. If you try caking it on, you will have a hard time getting it off, and you will end up with streaks. I have a silver frost Lincoln Town car, and the NXT brings out the metal flake in the paint. The car looks as good as it did when it was new, and it is currently three years old. The cost is a littie on the high side, but don't forget, if you want the best look, and protection, it wil cost you a little more. If you just want wax, get a bottle of a less expencive product ans call it a day. If you want the best look your can have, then use the NXT. YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS	1
I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else	0
I own a detail shop. I have tried many products over the years and have found the polymer products work the best. I use Zaino as my main finish protectant. But did give NXT Tech Wax a try. I always try new products on my own cars before any customers. I waxed both my 2004 auto's in the same weekend, 1 with Zaino's and the other with NXT Tech Wax.  As far as I can see the NXT went on and off as easy, left as deep a shine and seems to stand up to the eliments just as well as the Zaino's. With the only real difference being price I'll be using the NXT Tech wax from now on	1
"We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on.  The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed, but several presses got it to work a couple of times.  After about 6 uses it died completely.   Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever (like an electric kettle) is exactly, but these guys found it.

This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized"	0
The suction cups stay well on the window. I like the fact that I can adjust the size, and it doesn't have all the cutesy pictures. The only problem I had is I forgot I had it on at first, and I opened the car window. The suction cups busted off and got lost inside the door forever. Next time I'd try one that doesn't need suction cups, or supplies extra ones!	1
I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working.  When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more.  I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service.  They had no problem replacing the unit.  Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once.  And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row.  To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work.  Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on.  Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated.  I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was.  I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.  	0
 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE BATTERY TENDER I BOUGHT,I ALREADY OWN 1 AND HAVE HAD GREAT SERVICE WITH THIS PRODUCT. I ORDERED THE BATTERY TENDER FROM AMAZON.COM AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THERE SERVICE. I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER. I HAVE ORDERED A LOT OF PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM	1
I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat. 	0
Best item I ever bought. No more over or under charging with a stupid trickle-charger ever!!!	1
"   We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn't work out.  This item too didn't work for us.  It won't stick it there is a table cloth.  Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand!  It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth.

We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag...we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it.  At 14 months she doesn't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out. "	0
"This charger works great a charging a 12v battery.  It is very small and has two small clamps to attach to the battery.
If your battery is in an out of the way spot, you have the option of attaching a 2nd set of cables which attach to the battery permanently. Then you just plug the charger into the loose end of the cable.  When done charging, unplug hide the cable"	1
I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars	0
I have an older version of this charger that I bought in the mid 90's. I used it to maintain my garaged Mustang's battery over the winter months for many years. I made a cigarette lighter adapter so all I needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips. I have to say this thing is dead reliable! It always kept my battery in prime condition. I love it and recommend it highly. 	1
I was happy when this product arrived. It arrived in great time. I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets. It states that it should be used in the last trimester, I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat. I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong. It will pick up my heart beat, but not the babys. I can't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester. The greatest thing about this is the cd's I play them for the baby every now and then	0
Now I don't have to worry about a dead battery. Just plug the battery into the tender and I know the battery is going to be fully charged for the next start	1
I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business	0
If you have a vehicle that you don't use very often, use the Battery Tender to keep the battery charged.  It slow-charges your battery, then maintains the charge.  It works great	1
My experience has been similar to that of other reviewers. The one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro. My two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when I checked her in the middle of the night. Honestly, the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn't move their arms... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own	0
"This unit is a workhorse for the money. I use it on my Corvette in the winter and in the summer I have my snowblower attached to the battery tender. This product is compact in size and simple to use. It came with different adapters that enabled use with different battery charging requirements.

I recently gifted a unit to my father in-law who leaves 2 cars in Florida year round.

A must have for anyone who has a vechicle or seasonal piece of equipment."	1
My baby slid both down and off the side of this.  I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner.  I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me!  She could have suffocated!  I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy	0
This is my second battery tender that now maintains my V-ROD. My first tender is over ten years old and continues to function on my son's bike. Very easy to use and nothing to worry about	1
I had been told that these were wonderful, to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back. But my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides. This worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach	0
For ease of use, The Deltran Battery Tender is an excellent way to charge and maintain the battery on your motorcycle, snowmobile, or even a heavy- duty vibrator, not that I would know anything about that! The kit includes a BMW type plug for machines so equipped, and an SAE adaptor with alligator clips.  You can also wire the SAE adaptor right to your bike's battery and have easy access to the plug- in.  The battery is maintained in a peak state of charge, with no worries of over charging	1
"I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept.  The first night we used it, my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports.  He was horrified that our son could have suffocated.  This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits.

I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move at all"	0
Easy to read, compact and gives tons of information...direction (digital compass), time, temperature, ice warner, calendar automatically calibrates....what more can I want?! It's great, it's handy and I love it	1
I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser,  but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric.  It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad.  The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable.  I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one,  just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose	0
The best car wax you can get if you like a super shiny/mirror finish. Easy to apply and shine last through several washes. Highly recommended	1
This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight.  The screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks.  The rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom. I have another wipe warmer by Dex that doesn't seem to dry out the wipes and I have never seen rust	0
I was unable to locate this item at the retail stores and was lucky enough to find  the wax at you on-line store. I ordered four bottles and received within five days. I was really pleased and will order again. 	1
I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all, therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation. I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy. I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working. I would not recomend this pump, at least not to adoptive mothers. The customer service was awesome though!!! They were understanding and helpful. I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela.	0
I have a detail shop that puts out about 400-500 vehicles a month.And we have been in business for 8 years now.  So you can say that i have seen or used just about everyones waxes/polishes. Mothers FX  works great on the old cars as well as the newest 2006 models. I have witnessed the best results with one simple application. And it does last quite some time. It is the BEST product that I have ever used on a black or dark colored vehicles. NO MORE SWIRLS !!  If applied right you will not experience those annoying swirls and small scratches that come with alot of the leading competitors.Anyone can use this. From large detail shops like my own to someone under a tree or at the local self service carwash.IT REALLY IS THAT EASY !! And this product goes a very long way if applied right also. We have been able to use 1 bottle to about 25 vehicles. So it is well worth the price.  So basically you cannot go wrong with Mothers Fx Synwax. It is the best from the best and used by the best in the business. 	1
"IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.

I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.


The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but ""Tiny Love"" RUINED it by not putting a ""silent running feature button"" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!


If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.

I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.

I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry. "	0
I LOVE my tink floor mats! They look really good, and are supposedly easy to clean	1

Simply put, these are the best wiper blades I have ever used. When they wear out, I'll buy another pair regardless of their price. There is no better wiper blade on the market, period. No streaks, no skipping or sticking to the glass, and they lay flat even on the sharply-curved windshield on my '63 Galaxie. Buy them; you won't regret it, and they're a better deal than Rain-X liquid	1
This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.

I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart.  It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat.  It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back.  The result is that there is no support in the back.  My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her.  Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back.  I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in.  She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much.  I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else	0

Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat	0
I ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work. Overall they work fairly well. No problems jumping our work trucks. Chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford F150's. The light comes in handy. The air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire, and the hose is kinda short,but it does work. Other than that, it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see. I have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges. It recommends charging them once a month even if you don't use them. 4/5 Star	1

it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets	1

"$52.00 less weighted down by cash, and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target. Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like ""clear reception"" and ""no interference"" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond. 

We hooked it up in short order, turned it on, and *SCREEEECH*. Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever. We tried shutting that monitor off, and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away. No screeching, but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can. Totally distorted, useless. You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom. 

We've packed it carefully back into the box, and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight. Needless to say, I'd steer clear of this one. Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg"	0
"Although I have a bunch of things on my keychains, I've decided to start carrying this.  People make fun of me, but that one time you need such a tool, whether inside your vehicle or someone else's, this could save lives.

The great sleeve/cover for the blade works well.  It doesn't slip off easily (in case it's in your pocket, etc.), but with a little effort, it pops off as needed.

"I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything!  I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training.  And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't.  Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really ""go"" in the potty.

We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's ""potty time.""  When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more.  Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.  

If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.  

Here's a suggestion:  Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training.  Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do.  With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore"	0
It is a great item.  I just hope that I never have to use it	1
The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom	0
"That's the best tool. Small and yet powerful! I tested it!
ResQMe is my safety buddy"	1
"We bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds...

We had several major issues with it.

1)  The pee guard.  It doesn't really latch on and STAY on.  Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room.  As luck would have it, when I would go retrieve the item, he would pee and since there was no guard, the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat/ pot.   

To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics (super glue didn't work AT ALL) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training.  It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not.  But I had no choice- the guard HAD to stay on.

2) The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing.  He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went.

3) The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting.  He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby.  I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken.

4) When he was ready to use the actual potty, we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats.  Everytime he pees I have to hold down his ""bits"" because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat, thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc.  The pee guard is useless for this feature. Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down, if he wiggles or moves, then he is not in position... There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes.

It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store.  We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son's potty training experience.  The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us.  Finally, I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets.  It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best.

If we have another child, I am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter.  Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating.

"Excellent for the every day driver.
I got it as a gift, and bought 4 more for my family"	1
I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.	0
I am very pleased with the Solar Shed light.  The long cord makes it easy to use in any spot. Mine ended up under a kitchen cabinet.  It gives off a very nice light	1
"I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, ""Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?"" I replied ""PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!"" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!!"	0
"This SUPER BRIGHT light is great!  

     * Its solar (no need to string wires from the house)
     * It has a VERY bright light (sometimes solar lights can be on the weak side, but not this one)
     * A person could attach it to other places outside to -- it does a great job peircing through the dark night.

DEFINIITELY A MUST OWN IF YOU HAVE A SHED OR DARK SPOT IN THE BACKYARD"	1
I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months.  She hated it.  The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat.  She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller.  After several months of use, the wheel fell off.  Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.  Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers.  I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied.  This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better.  I would not recommend it to another consumer	0
"I used this to haul a 75-pound, 74-inch-long flat-pack furniture box about 100 miles on top of a 1994 Toyota Camry, and it worked just fine. I had my doubts when I bought it. I lost an upholstered chair on the Washington, DC Beltway once -- tied it down with rope and it took off like a kite. But this Highland carrier did the job. When putting it together, save yourself some aggravation and loop the straps through the plastic bases BEFORE you attach the bases to the crossbars (the instructions tell you to do the reverse, which makes the threading next to impossible). The pieces attached firmly to the roof of my Camry, with flat metal hooks going on the sills of the open doors. Once the doors are closed there's no way the hooks can come out. Make sure the straps are tight before you close the doors. This can be a little tricky as there seemed to be some slippage through the buckles, but with a little tugging and wiggling they snugged up pretty well. Note that the rubber feet that fit on the plastic bases provide grip and protect your roof when the carrier is on, but they fall off easily when it's not in use. I don't know why they weren't permenently attached. The maximum recommended load is 150 pounds but I didn't test it to the limit -- the crossbars look sturdy but they're hollow metal tubes, and they bounced a little under the weight of the box. Also, the bars have a textured finish but seemed a little slippery, so I wrapped some gritty no-slip tape around them (the kind used on stairsteps) to prevent any slippage. I attached the box to the carrier with two ratchet tie-downs (highly recommended over rope). The tie-down straps were looped once around the box and under each crossbar and the box didn't budge the whole trip home. One other thing, make sure to tie up any dangling straps -- the sound of them whacking against the roof of your car can be very disconcerting. An inexpensive solution that's good for temporary use with light loads on short trips in cars that don't have roof racks.     

Update: Used the carrier to haul two of the same box on the Camry, bringing the load right up to the 150-lb maximum -- rock solid all the way. I laid the long boxes side-by-side with the longest width down to spread out the weight as much as possible, then duct-taped them together and fastened them down good and tight with tie-downs and rope (Overkill? perhaps, but better safe than sorry and sued.) My next car will probably be a small SUV, but until then I'm glad I have this carrier. Inexpensive, easy to use and remove and does the job"	1
We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone. 	0
This is adorable. It's nice fabric and really creative, but a little difficult to put on my seat securely.	1
"I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story.  Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted.  I bought it because it was lightweight, had a front tray, adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color.  I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk.  Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips.  Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria:
- Poor steering.  Can not handle quick turns.
- Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun.
- 5 point harness is poorly designed.  The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled.
- My drink holder broke.
- Overpriced for features and quality.
My positives are:
- Nice looking
- Easy to fold
- Lightweight
I keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company.  Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room!  I would not buy a Peg Prego again"	0
The same with the frog bucket seatcover, very nice staff for just 15 bucks	1
"When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very ""user-friendly.""  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.  "	0
I collect fairies and was delighted to find this seat covers. I got them and they match wonderfully inside my truck (grey interior), however, my seat belts are located on the seat (i have an 03 GMC Envoy and I think a lot of GMC trucks are this way). So pay close attn before you buy this product.	1
"Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends. 

The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore."	0
These seat covers are allot prettier then the picture. Just recieved mine today and I am very pleased...	1
My son hated this mat at first, then he played in/with it for about 5 days...after that, it got old! Mighty quickly. My son is now about to make 5 months old, and he doesn't even want to look at it. Waste of money for me	0
"The colors were prefect for my car, blues and grays.  The soft velvet gives it a touch of richness.  The image is pretty, but could be a little better quality and well with the embordary.  The colors in the seat are more on the purple side and all the other ""Moonsprite"" items are blue, so not a prefect match.  Over all I am happy I got it"	1
"I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat.  My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY.  If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat.  I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer.  Honestly, now I am skeptical of any ""tummy time"" mat.  I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs.  Better off spending the money elsewhere"	0
"They are extremely nice seat covers ,the quality is great for such an inexpensive price. But they were huge in a Jeep Wrangler with no way to modify them to fit and had to be returned. Universal seat covers does say on package ""fits most"". So if they fit I think it is a good investment"	1
I was initially very happy with this product.  We purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed.  However, the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use.  Since I liked the product, I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one.  It, too, broke; so I'm now looking for a sturdier alternative	0
It is always hard to judge a product by a picture. They looked dark on my computer, but I ordered them anyway because I liked the graphic.I am so glad I did. They are actually a steel blue and they look great. I am very pleased and have recieved many compliments. They were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys.	1
I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	0
"I searched for new seatcovers only to find Hawaiian flower prints in almost all automtive stores. Then I found Amy Brown Moonsprite seatcovers. These were reasonably priced and were not some flower print. There's more to these, they have a soft feel to them like velour. My last set were nylon and some days would develop static and shock me every time I exited the car. The other thing is 
there are other products like floor mats that have the same moonsprite logo"	1
My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings. 	0
The Seat Covers are great......exactly what they look like in the picture and what I wanted.   I would definetly buy other things from amazon as long as they are this well pictured and the quality is amazing	1
I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6&quot; and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby	0
"I have an Acura CL TypeS, and I got this steering control when I got a Pioneer AVIC-D2. The unit wasn't too hard to setup, the manufacturer's website is pretty helpful. I did notice that it sometimes is pretty slow to process my steering wheel button presses. Rarely, it also completely ignores them, I have to let go of the button, pause, and press again.

Even with these little issues, I still like the unit, mostly because I can use my left hand to control the volume while my right hand is reaching for the phone, or whatever else"	1
There are so many other sling out there.  Don't waste your timeor money on this.  I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot.  It was also impossible to adjust.  I got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these. Bottom line, check out the other options, this one is a waste of $$$	0
This ashtray is made solid. I like quick extinguishing feature and if you open the lid all the way, the LED at the bottom lits up. I wish the LED was attached on the lid though. Overall great ashtray	1
This is by far the worst sling I have ever tried!  The padding is bulky and hot.  It is impossible to adjust.  Total waste of money.  I bought a pouch from www.equanimitybaby.com and it was perfect! easy to use and very comfy.  The bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk.   If you can't use this sling, its not you, its the sling	0
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE TINKERBELL. THIS WAS A CUTE AND INEXPENSIVE ADDITION TO OUR GROWING COLLECTIO	1
I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it	0

A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable.

I am pleased with this frame.  No logos and has a clean stainless steel look about it.  My only issue is the bottom part of the trim is a little tall and so Oregon plates which have a registration sticker tag that goes at the bottom of the plate is hardly visible.  	1
"I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get ""to"" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.  Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby"	0

If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product	0
"Ordered mine directly from Motive Products for about the same price.  Mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective.  After emailing Motive, they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing.

The unit worked as advertised.  A bit slow but be patient.  Remember to warm up the engine a bit (as directed in the instructions) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out.

"The ""Breathe Safe Padded Sheet"" also left a mesh imprint on my baby's face. Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine:

3) Removing & washing sheet & mattress pad
4) Wiping off mattress with soap & water

"This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. The Fairing definitely makes the ride a lot quieter, anyone who doesn't like ""wooshing"" should buy one without hesitation. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car"	1
Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off.  With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis.  I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier.  With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway.  I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple.  Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products.  By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway	0
I TRIED THE RACK WITHOUT THE FAIRING, THE NOISE AND TURBULENCE WAS TREMENDOUS.  ONCE I INSTALLED THE FAIRING, THE NOISE AND WIND BUFFETING DROPPED TO A POINT THAT I FORGOT THE RACK WAS ON THE CAR.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT...WELL WORTH THE PRICE	1
When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it. When we did try that, he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face	0

This is one awesome tool I was able to save big on this scanner; this is a tool that pays for itself. I was able to troubleshoot two of my co-workers vehicle without charging them, one was a BMW & the other one was a Lincoln town's car the next time everyone got to pay the piper. It definitely pinpoints the actual fault code. I had it for about 6 month; I just started to use it. I even found the problem with my 1988 Buick OBD I It's an amazing product. It has all the attachments for OBD II & I, which enables one to get the job done without, having those dealers & shop ripping you off. If you did take it to the shop after scanning your vehicle, you can definitely intimidate those dealership by representing your fault to them. Being that they know what your talking about, they will not tend to make markups suggestion to you, if you know what I mean	1

This is a very cute bouncer chair.  However, I feel it was poorly designed.  It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys.

 I have used this about 10 times now and it seems like a well built and designed unit that will suffice any garage or DIY mechanic.

Just a comment about the Eagle Talon comment.  In order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics.  I have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy.  I was a Jeep/Eagle technician for many years. Even though it says Eagle on your vehicle it is actually a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  That is why the connector doesn't work.  At the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars (there were others).  Also OBD1 & 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like ABS, etc if they are not linked.  We also had different connectors and equipment for different systems	1

It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.	0
I purchased this item for my father. It has definitely paid for itself! Just a heads up for those planning to purchase this item... The scanner itself is CP9145 NOT CP9150. I had 2 of these delivered and thought I was sent the wrong product each time. According to the manufacturer, a CP9150 is a CP9145 with extra cables included which allow you to test a greater selection of vehicles. Hope this helps	1
The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.	0

My 8 1/2 mo. granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night.  I've got the correct bumper pads, etc. but babies do move.  She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset.  I've only had the crib 1 week, she's gotten her leg stuck 2 times.  We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer. 	0

"way to easy to install! I had it installed and working in a few short minutes, if your looking for a new hoen to replace those little mortercycle type horns they put in cars these days than this is the one you want.

"Very poor construction and does not ""fit most sleigh cribs"" as advertised on the box.  This company should be ashamed of themselves for charging $70 for this product.  The concept is a good idea and could be so much better, but this company fails in execution.  ""Tots in Mind"" definately has something in mind, however it is not your Tots.  Buyer beware"	0
This horn set is a good deal at the Amazon price, and with no sales tax and free shipping, it is about $8 cheaper than the local auto store. I purchased this as the second replacement for a Toyota 4Runner. The compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads. This compressor looks better sealed, so that might make it last longer. Most Japanese cars come with weak horns, and this set makes up for them. They tend to scare the unwary (a good thing). The installation is straight-forward, but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay, compressor and horns. To keep it simple, I tapped off the existing horn wire, ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels	1

I like the looks of these wipers the low profile puts them out of my line of sight.

I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just  not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend  more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this.	0

I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck.  I HATE IT!!  My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there.  Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.  Why buy extra toys??  I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys.  I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange.  What a waste of money for me.  I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too.  My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym.  Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys. 	0

I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats.  I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall.  The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it. The playmat is cute, but it isn't functional, not to mention, WAY OVERPRICED.  The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out.  He has never liked this playmat.  I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more	0
I was very pleased with this charger. I was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low. My van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out. After reading info about other chargers I decided on this one.  I read the directions connected it and it did the job. I called Black and Decker and they were very helpful with any questions I had. This is a small price to pay for the convenience, certainly better then having to call a tow truck. It's portable and lightweight, stores easy.I never charged a battery in my life and I was able to do it	1
We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.

They are regular bungees...just hard to find this size in the stores...good for small needs	1
I received a SwaddleMe as a gift.  The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son, the velcro pieces didn't meet.  In other words, the wrap was too large.  I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.  A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it.  It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well	0
"I can't tell you what a lifesaver this blanket is. I live in Utah where the winters here can get pretty cold. It definately makes going outside and riding in the car easier to handle. I love it so much, I'm going to give my mother this for Christmas. She suffers from bad arthritis in her legs and feet which is a bad combination when the cold hits her. One of the things she loves, is heat. Even sometimes in the summer she prefers the heat in the car. This of course is not easy from my dad since he's the complete opposite from my mother where he likes the cold. My parents often go on car trips for a few days to get away, and I can see where this may fit in because the heater from the car won't be on so much so both my parents can be comfortable. 

Thank you so much for this product Amazon! :) "	1
"We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.

Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.

Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.

We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.

It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.

So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now"	0
After the usual wash and clay bar usage i can sit a bottl on my hood and it wont slide off.. after using the hd cleanes even on the slightest incline the paint is so silky smooth that it will slide right off.. this product is great but, with its dark brown color it can stain some scratches in lighter color cars ( i have a pearl white one) it isnt a bad stain but it is noticeable and hard to get out if not careful.. also consider the applicator that you use with this product for this product only as there is no washing out the dark brown stains... after using this applying the zymol wax is a breeze.. it buffs out much easier and the shine is nic	1
"The idea of the stroller is great. However after purchasing and using it, it isn't well equipped. There is no cup holders, the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn't even big enough to hold a diaper bag, let alone any bags when shopping. I also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk. Need less to say I don't even use it much b/c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids. I wasted my money on this.

Great for cars that no longer install ashtrays, example Honda. Traps all odor. Once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it's also easy to use at night. I don't think it's a great ashtray but a great disposal system. If a LD light was installed it would be even better for nightime use	1

I will not buy these again.  They are tiny, thick and do not tapper on the edges.  This means you will see the lines thru your shirts. The adhesive isn't enough and the pads shifted durring the night.  I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela, they cover more, are thinner and stick better. 	0

I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)	0

"This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this ""system""  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive... 

The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The ""s"" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier ""s"" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the ""arms"" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!    

Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the ""clips"" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is ""too small""??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.  

This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) ""s"" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to ""deal"" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!"	0
"I have used Rain-X for over ten years now.  I am still amazed at what it does for glass.  The spray bottles or wipes have worked best for me.  Do not apply or buff with a cloth you intend to keep as the chemicals degrade fabrics.  Cheap paper towels do just fine.  Some people complain about glare after applying it, but a good buffing or the next car wash or rain shower will take care of any places you missed.
Windshield, side glass and even my mirrors are treated three to four times a year.  No, it is not intended to replace using wipers, but any consistent cruising speeds over 30 mph and water rolls right off.
I have experimented with spraying rubber scraps & plastics, it degrades and dries rubber trim fast due to the evaporatives in Rain-X"	1

Great product. Used it for 5 years now. Limit the streaking by two ways: Using a spray bottle, lightly mist a paper towel then buff the glass after product dries.

It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl	0
"I bought this scanner as a Xmas gift for my dad.  He's tested it on his GM Pickup and my Mom's Pontiac.  It sync'd up with the cars and worked as advertised.

This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago.  We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well.  It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be.  I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump & Go).  People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier.  Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump & Go version a lot	0
For less than $200 you get a reader with a large backlit screen and one that can also give a live data feed from your car's sensors. It also supports CAN (controller area network) which by 2008 will be a new standard, a standard that Ford and foreign auto makers have already adopted. Did I mention it also comes with a serial cord to connect to your PC? This is a very fun DIY toy you'll enjoy for years	1

Smaller is definitely better when it comes to power balls.  I bought the original one and it worked well, but was hard to get into the smaller portions of my wheels.  I did not use the extension rod much.  I still used my dremil in some of the corners, but if you want to polish you wheels with less effort than just a rag and some elbow grease it is much better.  The polishing compound that comes with the set works very well also	1

I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.	0
"IN A NUTSHELL: 

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN IT'S RAINING & YOUR TIRE GOES FLAT IN WAL-MART'S PARKING LOT?

This happened to me today and I was scared out of my wits. I had an hour to get home before my six-year-old son got off the school bus. I was 25 miles away and I just saw my rear tire and knew it had no air in it. I recalled using this product about 6 years ago and that it worked, so I ran into Wal-Mart and skipped the items I had come shopping for and went straight to the automotive section to hunt for this stuff. Twenty minutes later, standing in the parking lot, I read the directions and realized that I had to try to find what was leaking and remove it if possible. After breaking a small screwdriver and bending a key for a car we sold 5 years ago, I managed to remove a nail that was about 4 inches long -- the trouble was that the rest of the air leaked out rather quickly once I pulled out the nail. 

READ AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!

The directions on the can stated that the valve stem had to be in the 8 o'clock position so I had my teenage daughter back the car up until the valve stem was at the 8 o'clock position. I shook the can for over 30 seconds as Angela timed me, then I screwed the hose attachment into the valve stem. It whooshed as a stream of white, foamy liquid rushed through the transparent tubing into the tire. I could hear air rushing in with it but then I recalled what had actually happened the last time I used this stuff about 6 years ago. 

You guessed it, the hole was towards the top of the tire and the foam never got there allowing the air to simply escape very nosily out the hole. Since the flat was in the rear of my front-drive Plymouth Voyager Minivan, I drove it to a gas station that I knew had air, about 6 miles away. I went about 25 mph and many people hailed me as they drove alongside to inform me that I had a flat tire.

BUT THEN SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED

By the time I reached the Chevron Station with the air, still some 20 miles from our home, I was convinced that I had turned the flat tire into spaghetti and that we would miss the bus. Well, I am happy to report that this was not the case. From traveling slowly, the tire had circulated that white sealant foam and had heated up some due to the extra friction caused by running without air. I filled the tire up and to my surprise there was no sound of escaping air. The sealant held and I drove, at a somewhat reduced speed, the remaining 18-20 miles in about 38 minutes to get home about 2 minutes ahead of the bus.

BOTTOM LINE: HAVE AN AIR SOURCE NEARBY IF YOU PULL OUT THE NAIL

This stuff does work, but after you pull out a nail from your tire it may be rather difficult to get it to hold the air before it can circulate and heat up within the tire. This was my actual experience with this exact product today, and it is consistent with what happened 6 years ago. In short, have an air supply lined-up when you insert the sealant as close as possible to where you remove the nail and insert the sealant. This will reduce the risk of running the tire flat and rendering it unserviceable. If you do this, you stand an excellent chance of executing a fast emergency repair that anybody can manage and, like me, you too might save the day.

"I should have checked this out before registering for it.  The lid won't stay shut, the bottom wipes brown, the unit leaks.  I contacted the manufacturer.  When telling him about the lid not staying shut, he asked, ""are you sure there isn't a ghost in the house""...they offered to replace it if I returned it to them,  offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products.

After reading these reviews I think I'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product"	0
I've used this product for the last 10 years.  I keep one in my trunk at all times.  The Fix-A-Flat will work on small holes the size of nails.  Shake it hard then add it to the tire like an air hose.  The tire will inflat enough for you to drive it to a local gas station for air	1
We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes... that is... until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day.  It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom.  Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model, but after searching online, I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had, and now have decided to buy a different brand.  I did keep the water filled, and still had a poor experience.  Save your money and invest in a different brand	0
"I probably went through 5 different ""suction cup"" mounted compasses and none of them worked properly.  There are too many magnetic fields in a vehicle for them to work properly without calibration.

This compass however worked great within 5 minutes.

Installation is easy enough, and once it's mounted all you need to do is hold the button down for 5 seconds to put the compass in ""calibration"" mode, then drive around in circles slowly until it stops flashing.

Granted, you do look like an idiot driving in a circle in a parking lot somewhere, but once you are done the compass works just like one that you would find factory installed.

The only complaints are that the actual sensor feels kinda cheap and it came apart slightly when I was mounting it.  It just snapped back together though.  Also, the back light just stays on for 3 seconds.  I'd rather have it stay on for 10, but you need to think how long it really takes you to read two letters?

If you actually want a compass for your car and it didn't come with one, this is the only one I've found that actually works.

So just buy it.  :"	1
This wipe warmer is more trouble than it's worth.  The water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table.  As a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes.  I emailed the manufacturer regarding this product  to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective.  They failed to respond	0

This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move. We use cloth wipes it has burned a few, smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it (never happened with any of our other wipes warmers) won't stay closed. It actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it. Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table. GET a different warmer this one is awful	0

"We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing!

"I'm a big fan of the high-end Flukes so I've worked with the best. Well, these defintitely aren't the best, but you can't beat what you get for the price. I got it for my brother for his car and it does the job well.

First, the bad:
1. No auto shut-off. You gotta make sure you turn it off or the battery will just keep draining away.
2. No auto-sensing. You gotta set the dial for the range you're looking for. But hey, I like it so much I don't care that I can't be so lazy.

And the good:
1. All the features. You get all the standards PLUS a tach and a dwell-meter! That'll about cover your carbureted cars.
2. Price. You can find multimeters that can't do the extras for the same price and even more. Great bargain.
3. Alligator clips. Simple things but it'd be a pain without them.

I have 2 wipes warmers - one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  At one point, I had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work - mine took FOREVER to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section; same as previous reviews, the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly.  I have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine.  Do not waste your money on the Munchkin warmer	0
This multimeter is an all around good tool. It has all the features you need plus some of the features that only the more expensive ones have. Like the battery tester and backlight display. I am studying electronics right now and I find myself getting a ton more use out of it than I thought I would. It is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along. There are comperable multi-meters out there that cost less but most would cost more. There are certainly better multi-meters than this one but they will cost more. The only bad things I can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to. You have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart. Actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it. Also most multi-meters come with some sort of rubber, protective sleeve, that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it. If this mult-meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out, I would have given it a 5 Stars.	1
This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won't stay closed.  I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table.  The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid.  Don't buy this wipe warmer, there are better ones out there.	0

I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this	0
Very smooth transaction. Shipping was timely and product as good or better than advertised. Good supplier. Would recommend using based on my experience	1
I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks.  At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it	0
WOW! I couldnt believe that they actually made a hitch for my sports car. The car manual said that it is not possible to put a hitch on the RX8, but I really wanted one to accomodate my hitch bike rack. I ordered this one and it fit perfectly - in fact the holes in the hitch mounting bar lined up with holes already in the car frame, like the car was designed to accept this hitch! It only took me about one hour to install - didnt even have to remove the tires or jack the car up! Very easy installation	1
This toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move.  It ends up moving all around and I can not see in the mirror.  The plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat.	0

I just took a course from the Florida Highway Safety program.  I thought something like this would be wonderful, especially for little ones in the rear facing position.  I was dead wrong.  Anything put in front of, on the side of, in fact, anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash.  This toy, even latched down, poses a threat to the baby.  He or she may just have to be bored for a while.  On long trips have Mom or Dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment	0
Not to sound like a copycat, but it does what its supposed to do.  Read codes, erase codes, run low-level diagnostics.  You probably can't run a repair shop with it, but it certainly will add a level to your shadetree shop	1
This is very cute but my baby is chubby. It gave him a cut and bruises on both legs. The seat isn't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off. I wish it was bigger cause this is really cute. So if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts	0
I've used this Actron CP9175 AutoScanner Diagnostic Code Scanner with Freeze Frame Data for OBDII (Post-1996) Vehicles, on a 2001 Lincoln towncar and a 1999 BMW Z3. In both cases, the device performed flawlessly, and I'm very pleased with the ease of use	1
I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple. The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable, although leakage city!  My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps	0
I orginally bought this at an auto parts store and realized that evening (after getting home and doing some online reasearch)that I could buy it on amazon.com for almost half the cost that I payed at the auto parts store.  So needless to say, I returned the one that I purchaced at the auto parts store and bought from amazon.com.  It's a great investment!  Saves from having to go the the dealership to have them run a computer on a vehicle.	1
"I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance.  After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor.

The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.  

The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).  We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the ""blowouts"", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean.  It has been a wonderful new baby tool"	0

Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle	0

I bought this potty seat for my daughter and I took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets. The second I put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet!

"  Prior to 1998 you could use the MIL (Multifunction Indicator Light) codes on your dash. This tool accomplishes the same thing plus a lot more. In these days of computerized cars it's a necessity if you wish to fix your own vehicle. Don't expect this tool to tell you exactly what went bad and what part to replace. You need to have a working knowledge of automotive mechanics, and a service manual of the vehicle is a great help (almost a must). This tool will steer you in the right direction.
  Example; My car's transmission quit dead in the road without any prior warning. Do I take it to a dealer and spend much $$$ $2400 or so for a rebuild? Not yet. My scanner said ""Gears #1,2,3,4 had the wrong gear ratio.""  Huh wot??  Well, after examining my service manual,I determined that a sensor that measures input and output speeds must be bad.

I was tired of buying new wipers every few months.  I live in Minnesota and the salt and cold quickly wear out wiper blades.

"Really. I've used the 'premium' blades and I've used the cheapo blades. All of them have done an adequate job but none of them could keep up with the kind of thundershowers which seem to blind you on the freeway worse than the thickest fog. That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was ""out there"" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.  "	1

I have tried many different wiper blades on both my car and my wifes. I thought I take a chance on these after reading some of the reviews. All I got to say now is, WOW! These blades are whisper quiet and clean the glass so well I am very impressed. We had an overnight sprinkle and when I got into the truck the next day the spots were all dry, a few quick wipes with the washer fluid, and it was almost crystal clear!! 5 year warranty, these have to be the best blades out there!	1
I bought this sling when I was still pregnant.  After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet.  When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this!  I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful.  First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby.  I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again	0
"All I can say is wow... just... wow. I wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades for the Bosch blades I had (they were about a year and a half old and weren't holding out well). I did my research and decided to look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much about them. I was first going to get the PIAA brand, however the price and five year warranty the Silblades offered changed my mind. I haven't looked back since. 

One of the things I hated about my old blades is they ended up making a lot of noise when sliding against the windshield unless there was a decent amount of water pouring down. From the first day I installed these onto my car and that first rain drizzle came down I was sold. The blades are whisper quiet, even with just a little moisture on the glass. You literally won't hear them. Heck, they are quiet even if you have no water on the glass. All you will hear is the motors that turn the blades. My old Bosche blades weren't anywhere near that quiet, even right out of the box. 

The Silblades seem to work really well in getting the water off the windshield too. I dare say better than any other blades I have used. Some other blades I had would sometimes leave a thin trail of water still on the glass, but not the Silblades. Everything wipes clean from the blade's path. Also it's true what they say about the silicone in the rubber leaving a protective coating. The rain on your windshield will start to bead just like after waxing your car. I can't say it happened immediately because... well my windshield was waxed the day before I installed the blades. However the beading has lasting much, much longer than it should have from waxing alone. 

I live in Houston, TX so I'm love how these blades hold up against the searing heat. No cracks yet or even color fading. I can't tell you how well they do in snow and ice since we don't get much of either here, and I haven't travelled anywhere to test the blades on that yet. However I don't doubt the manufacturer's claims on standing up to the bitter cold. 

The PIAA silicone blades claimed they could do all of these things too. However they were $25 per blade and were only guaranteed to work a year. The Silblades have a five year warranty and the price can't be beat. If you really, REALLY want a noticeable difference in our windshield wiping experience then I suggest you grab these for your own vehicle. You will thank me for it."	1
"...not much more...for us, at least.  we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors!  but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby.  we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and ""breast friend"" sling much better.  sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling.  ;-"	0
These wipers are of the finest quality. They do a wonderful job of clearing the rain from your windshield. I highly recommend them for replacement of your current wiper blades. You won't be disappointed in these excellent wipers. I've tried many, these are the best and they're made in the USA	1
My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..	0
Great wiper for Toyota Avalon. Fits perfect, works smooth and cleans better than original	1
I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster. 	0
I've had it three weeks and nothing has come loose yet.  Seems to be doing the job	1
We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething. One day, she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth. the metal from one of the bells cut her lip! We let her play with the other ones still, but the one with the bells is put away at least until she's older	0
This is the first clay bar system I used, and it's still the best. You absolutely need to use this before you wax, or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish, creating more annoying swirl marks. Doing this step before you wax is a bit more work, but it's worth it. I could live without the Mother's wax they include with the kit, as I don't use it. But I always use this before I wax my car. That glass-like feeling your paint gets is amazing	1
"Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The ""restraints"" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The ""adult drink cup holder"" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The ""saddle bags"" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it"	0
Product is just outstanding really deserves the 5 star rating it has in amazon.My vehicle had tree sap mist all over its finish i tried many diffrent waxes even tried compond and nothing i was begining to lose hope until a little research on the net about clay bars and ran into this product.It took me about 3hrs to do my entire car and although it was plenty of work i could not belive the result its a mirror finish the paint looks gorgeous highly reccomend this treatment	1
"Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).  

When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position.

CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy.

Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name ""Jeep"" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better"	0
This product removed overspray in about two hours and saved me a ton of money.  I was lucky to find out about this system and highly recommend it.  It's easy to use, just wash and dry your car, and then in 2 feet blocks spray the lubricant and gently rub the clay bar on your car, wiping off excess lubricant and finishing with the wax included in the kit.  My car looks like it did when it came off the lot! Couldn't be happier	1
"Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of ""occasional use."" I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump"	0
"After reading numerous raving reviews here at Amazon.com and at several other sites, and learning that auto clay was safe for clear coat paints because it works through a non-abrasive process, I decided to give it a try -- and boy, was I glad I did!

My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash. It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.

That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it has a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.

Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-doh�) and it is used along with the included ""lubricant"" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)

Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!

I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation. Go on, try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint. It's worth every penny and I'm sure you'll be glad you did!"	1
"I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.

For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:

TRY THIS ONE IF...
- You have a very abundant milk supply
- You only plan to pump one or twice a month
- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period

INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...
- You're going back to work
- Your milk supply is medium to low
- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month
- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)

Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)"	0
"I first bought the Mother's Clay Bar system a year ago.  It sat on the shelf until I tried it on my two year old Honda CR-V.
It took less than 45 minutes to treat and wax my whole car and the vehicle now looks better than when I bought it.   You can actually hear those little rust causing impurities coming off the finish.  Stop destroying your clear coat or settling for less than a perfectly smooth finish get this product!  I do not own stock in,  or work for,  Mother's Car Care prducts"	1
I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time	0

I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far	1
This was the second pump I purchased. I was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand I bought. This pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the AC plug in is much weaker than the other side. The motor died out after 2 weeks of use. This pump is not meant for everyday use. I just bought a Medala and I hope to have a better expeirence with it	0
"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old.  At first, he seemed a little intimidated by the toys, and would cry when I put him in it.  Once he got used to it, he really enjoyed it.

My son loved this!  I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame.  I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down.  I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was.  Once he was walking, he didn't use it again	1
I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump. This is a bad breast pump. I couldn't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples.

If I could have rated this a negative I would have	0
We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	1
This is the worst pump you could buy.  I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down.  It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work.  PLEASE don't waste your money.......  I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product.  If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing.  I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product	0
"I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper.  It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed.  I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame.  They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise.  Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.  

The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious.  There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though"	1

I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower.  The products lather up really well and they smell great!  They are gentle and they don't make my daughter get a rash.  You get a lot of product for the price too.  My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold.  Now that my daughter is teething, she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin.  The moisturizing stick works great for this.  We love this gift set and would recommend it.	1
"I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. 

I will simply list the things I do not like:
1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had.
2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any.
3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary).
4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those.
5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks.
6) The MP3 player, which is the ""cool factor"" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller."	0
"If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.

"I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! 

But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to.

The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too...

Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. 

On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price.."	0
I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product	1
"I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a ""leg separator,"" which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;"	0
This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it.  We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability.  I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall.  I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great.  When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive!  I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something	1
"Ok, this chair is fine except for two very important things.  One: the tray is huge, and not in a good way, in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way. Also, the two trays that fit on top, that are dishwasher safe, ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER!!! So what's the point???
Two: it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY, rather than on the chair...making it impossible to set down anywhere when it's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair.  Everything else, about the chair is great, but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair.  I'm bought the one that's made by the famous toy maker, and love it"	0
In terms of pre-natal resources, this is the best I have found!  The positive results are proven.  I can not think of a reason not to buy this product.  Every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child.  This system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born.  You will even notice a response from your baby!  It's very exciting	1
I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror.	0
I purchased this item (not from Amazon) and my child loved it! The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great, not the usual 'kid-drivel' that usually is part of any kid item.  Some HBB's come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon.  Highly recommended	1
I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can't hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby's face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan.  He's in an infant car seat though and I couldn't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror. I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest.  I'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now. Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn't bother.  On the window, it would be held by suction and I really don't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby	0
I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc.  I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc	1
I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby.  Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash.  So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless.  I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in.  Don't waste your money	0
WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT.  IT REALLY KEEPS THE BABY WARM EVEN IN THE COLDEST WINTER.  WHEN THE WIND IS WHIPPING, THE GENEROUS FRONT FLAP FLIPS UP OVER THE CARRYING ARM OF THE BABY SEAT AND ALSO KEEPS THE BABY WARM.  NO FUSSY COATS AND HUNDREDS OF BLANKETS.  I HOPE TO USE IT NEXT WINTER ALSO	1
I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy.  Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva.  Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc.  I just don't see the difference in that and not using it.  My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc.  I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material!  My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.  You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth	0

Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare	0
A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read.	1
"I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for.  It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic). 
I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled.  It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't.  It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles.  Ahhhhh"	0
The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement.  I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt( I have a small frame and it is big on me) and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it's done.  Very friendly, amazing customer service, that's hard to find these days! 	1
This item is misleading because it runs VERY small.  I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG!  I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen.  Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help.  If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine). It is definately made for taller, longer-torso women (aka 6 ft. models). I would go with another type of support if given another chance	0
"This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life!  It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus"	1
"If I could have given this no stars I would have. This product in L-XL only fits a pre-pregnancy 28""-34"" waist. And in sizes that only goes up to a 18. So now I'm on the search for something a little bit bigger.  So if your pre-pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side, dont waste your money or time by getting this"	0
I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago.  I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times.  This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly.  Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks.  The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky.  My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around.  By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's.  By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters.  I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3.  Do I credit the Baby Plus?  Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby #2.	1
"I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first ""big girl"" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed"	0
A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system.  I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20.  I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system.  I feel like I am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way.  While using BabyPlus, the battery cover clips snapped off.  I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover, no questions asked.  BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby, rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts	1
I am so disgusted that I woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a Dora toddler bed. I held the Dora toddler bed until christmas, when on Christmas eve I went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong  and I was unable to assemble the bed at all. I ended up returning the bed, in exchange fr nothing. I found out that they no longer carry the bed.	0
"I am using the babyplus system for the second time and  am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old.
Faith was born alert, calm, and hardly cried at all as an infant. She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat.
She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write, sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts. Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble.
Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination  with activities and sports.
I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system.
I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again.
Do not be afraid to try something new. Just read the studies and reviews, they speak for themselves.
You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child."	1
wow-  cheap plastic, poorly routed holes, took 1/2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction - sent it back - my daughter loved the Dora picture and was very sad that she couldn't keep it	0
I bought this swing because our first baby had colic & reflux and I heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic.  I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing.  No colic this time, but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top.  She follows them around with her eyes.  Very stimulating for the young ones	1
"I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. &#60;br /&#62;
What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child"	0
I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall	1
"My son, who was used to using a wood stool (8"" tall with slick wood feet) fell climbing up on this because the top (foot area) is too small and it tipped on him!  It's only 6"" wide on top.  Not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on.  If you push it in toward the toilet there is NOTHING left for the child to stand on.  If you leave it out, then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste.  Getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top.  

His feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet - not coming near the top of this 8 1/2"" tall stool.

This is advertised as being 10"" tall (actually 8 1/2"") 14"" long (correct, but top surface is only 11 1/2"") and 10"" wide (also correct but again, it is only 6"" wide on top)

The rubber feet are great for non-skid purposes, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this. "	0
Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub	1
Nine days from MN to PA seems too long; perhaps Target Direct got process problems.   I AM NOT SATISIFIED...got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for $1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	0
I purchases this basket for a friend. I was very pleased with its usefullness style. It arrived in two days of ordering	1
I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!	0
I am a Mother of 6 and this works. You can put a few baby neccessities in it. I use it for a few diapers, baby wipes, desitin, and the bulb syringe. I can move it around and it does not take much space	1
I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it	0
I orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things. It got too heavy & everything wouldn't fit. So now I use it to hold his baby tylenol, etc. It is really nice.	1
These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.	0
I purchased this to put on the changing table.  I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc.  I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one.  It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc.  I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over.  This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby.  The price was also reasonable.  I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount.  This basket is a great buy	1
We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase.  First of all, we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work, since they make you order each little piece separately.  We spent all night putting it together and it didn't work for us.  The actual gate is very small, I don't see how it would be big enough for any opening.  Even with the extension kit, it was still not long enough.  The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart.  It is a very poor design and way overpriced.  We spent over $150 (with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart.  Save your money and buy a different gate	0
"We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much.  But, since my 2-month old still ""lives"" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue.  However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper.  (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!)  The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me.  We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the ""main"" center part.  I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed.  (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.)

The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon.  (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!)  We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle"	1
I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen.  Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes it impossible to close with one hand. Even if you don't care about the one-hand feature, it is still a hassle to adjust.  I do not suggest buying this gate.	0
When my third child was born, we got this tub.  It has been the best yet for us.  From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly.  As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached.  We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.  Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time.  No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead	1
Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards.  It was not sturdy at all, returned it	0
Great product.  Son enjoys being in the chair.  He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray.  Only thing I don't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion	1
I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area. I was totally wrong!!! Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand. Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry, 'cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it. Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose, so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly, the bottom one is to lose and not secure. I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it, only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes. I would have returned this gate, but I trashed the box before I installed it	0
"My mother-in-law bought these for my daughter.  At first, I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be, but my daughter took to them right away.  In the beginning, she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise, but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures.  She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up.

They won't entertain her for hours, but she's always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day"	1
This gate is almost totally useless -- unless your doorways and walls are all /perfectly/ plumb and square AND happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock, that is... 	0
"Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier.

At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through ""both"" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them"	1
"I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing ""pad"" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags"	0
My 6 month old got these for Christmas.  They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in.  She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg, but it broke.  I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite.  They are sending a free replacement!  We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	1
I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child	0
My son loves these blocks. We've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set. He loves saying the colors, numbers and stacking them	1
The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts	0
My daughter loves this toy!  All the activites keep her entertained and it gives us a break, too :	1
I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib.  I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards	0
My daughter loves this activity center.  I wish they would change two things about it.  I wish we could change out the toys and it folded up	1
"I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed.
I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon"	0
I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far	1
This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months	0
"We waited until our daughter was [...] to get her this, and it's fantastic!  She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...]  I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it.  (It was a poop-eroo for us too.)

A few things that I learned using this though is:
The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it.  It is incredibly hard to clean.
The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside.
My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it.  I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet"	1
"I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came.  Well, the ""mattress"" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry.  I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all.  I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface.  Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed.  If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars.  I'm so let down by this product"	0
My son loved this!  I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame.  I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down.  I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was.  Once he was walking, he didn't use it again	1
This is a great product for a few weeks, then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out!  I go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out.  No matter how tight I make the blanket, the velcro comes apart.  I encourage you to buy their other SwaddleMe blanket with the larger velcro flap. 	0
We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	1
This product was a waste of my money.  It was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use.  My husband tore it off the day after we got it.  I would rather use duck tape then this product :)  :	0
"If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.
I keep all of the ""out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!
The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!"	1
I was really unhappy with this lock.  It not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	0
"I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't.  It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!

I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.  

The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!

I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. 

I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be"	1
"I received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow.  Although the tag reads ""100% cotton,"" it is most certainly not the soft, 100% jersey cotton advertised.  The print is cute, but I was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling.  I gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising, but if one is looking for a nice, regular cotton crib sheet, this would probably be okay"	0
THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER, IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU. I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE. MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME. I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL. THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE. VERY SENSITIVE, I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE (I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP). IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME (I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC). I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE. THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE. TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN. THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT, I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WET!!!!!!, BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON'T HURT IT	1
"Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial.  It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth.  Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing.  I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.

This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.  Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap"	0
I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product	1
LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED	0
I've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor.  We have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference. I've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception.  I think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it	1
This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son.  So since I got it and used it.  My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged.  It was one of the worst experiances.  I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby.  I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one.  I am know expecting again and looking for a pump.  I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again	0
My husband and I adore this monitor.  It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great.  We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away.  The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up.  I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house.  I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long!  You can defintely trust this monitor	1
I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone	0
We live in the cold, rainy Northwest part of the country.  This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December. It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital.  We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat.  He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me.  This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby.  It is a must for Winter babies.  It is well worth the money	1
"I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant).  My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser.  For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway.  My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel ""too snug"" in it.  They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep.  If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it"	0
"Wow!  This is the best thing I received for my baby.  It has saved me sooo much time.  I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this.  I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit.  We just never use them.  I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller.  She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy.  When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller.  It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination.  She never felt the cold!

It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats. "	1
We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture	0
"This is a great pack'n'play.  It's easy to set-up and take any place.  The bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that I have.  The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby's attention.  My only problem is the piece for the top.  Whenever I try to use it, the arms bow in and it doesn't look very sturdy.  I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground.  It just doesn't seem very sturdy and I have tried everything.

Other than that, I am glad that I bought this!"	1
I ordered this crib almost a month ago and I couldn't be more disappointed. Every single piece was damaged somehow-- either chipped, cracked, discolored or stained... I will NEVER buy a Storkcraft piece EVER AGAIN. Don't waste your time and money on this crib!!!!!!!!!!!	0
My little girl loves this play space! The colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that I can get dinner on or help with home work. The only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes.	1
"I looked amazing on the computer but let me tell you it was Ugly!
we had recived it my mail and it was cheap plastic fake wood!!! Needless to say it went back!!! I also was upset by the way it was delivered it was left on my front patio blocking my door in the pouring rain... So i am sure the crib was wet as well"	0
I think for your money you get a great value for this playard.  It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this.  It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with.  The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others.  It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops.  The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars	1
"My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a ""Depot"" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0"	0
"Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product.  From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby.  She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open.  Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds.  Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch.  She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little ""lay lay lay"" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's.  

Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst.  Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation!  At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals.  She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition.  Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! 

When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, ""if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it"".  We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours.  We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.

"We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's ""cheaper"" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again."	0
ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny	1
We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex	0
The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement.  I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt( I have a small frame and it is big on me) and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it's done.  Very friendly, amazing customer service, that's hard to find these days! 	1
I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.	0
"This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life!  It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus"	1
We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it!  With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand	0
I bought this swing because our first baby had colic & reflux and I heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic.  I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing.  No colic this time, but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top.  She follows them around with her eyes.  Very stimulating for the young ones	1
I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first. I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out. The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest...I have an average build but have a chest....and it would'nt reach. My friend tried it also and had the same problem. I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake	0
I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall	1

"Reasons why I do not like this potty:

1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty!
2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways.
3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty.
4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess.

I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield"	0
"We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much.  But, since my 2-month old still ""lives"" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue.  However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper.  (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!)  The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me.  We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the ""main"" center part.  I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed.  (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.)

The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon.  (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!)  We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle"	1
definately NOT a potty for boys. As with other reviewers, the shield does not stay on. Looking for another simple and basic potty now :o	0
"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. This bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as I bought it the price reduced on Amazon. This had been a constant problem on Amazon and I think somebody should do something about it. I think I should get a refund :-)..

Shobhn"	1
Though this potty is nicely priced, it's worth it to buy a more expensive one.  Though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers, it does shift around on the base, allowing for spillage.  The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat, so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside, not just in the receptacle.  The inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it's impossible to clean messes out of it.  It does serve it's purpose as a potty, but I'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one	0
I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!!  She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her.  She really enjoys bathtime.  And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby...  you will really enjoy it.  I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her.  After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place.  Caution:  Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size.  This tub is perfect if you do that!  The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use.  Please read the directions.  Both you and your child will appreciate that you did	1
"I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart.
Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!"	0
"Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier.

At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through ""both"" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them"	1
"I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying ""here you go"".  It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty.  There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning.  Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy"	0
My 6 month old got these for Christmas.  They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in.  She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg, but it broke.  I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite.  They are sending a free replacement!  We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	1
I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son.  When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable.  I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face.  So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference.  It didn't.  He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz.  I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all.  A big disappointment.  If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn.  A million times better than this	0
My son loves these blocks. We've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set. He loves saying the colors, numbers and stacking them	1
I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.  	0
"These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy.  Each has different textures, images, and something unique about it.
-The yellow block has a duck on the one side that ""quacks"" when pressed.  On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror.  Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif.
-The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another.
-The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake.  It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif.
-The blue block is another rattle.  It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another.
-All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English).  The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding).
My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying ""soft"", ""smooth"", or ""bumpy"" and she loves the feelings.  My friend's daughter, who is five months, loves to pick up and throw down the blocks.  It's one of her favorite games.  I'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant"	1
Rather than this sling... I recommend you check out [...] for your sling.  They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors.  This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier	0
"i really liked this swing--i have the older model papasan swing, nothing was wrong with it i just wanted the new model.
i loved the pink and the fact that i could plug it in"	1
When my daughter was tiny, she enjoyed being in this sling... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes. The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose. 	0
"I have recently had my FIFTH child and so I have experienced many baby items, including swings, and this one is the BEST!  It has a cushiony, comfy seat for baby with different recline options; soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at; several musical tunes with adjustable volume control.  There is also a dial to set the swing motion -- to go slowly or faster -- and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side, or front to back.  Sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back, and she'll cry -- we then change the swing position to go side to side, and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep.  And vice versa, sometimes we put her in side to side, and she wants to swing front to back -- how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she's in the mood for!  As my husband says, ""this is the best money we've ever spent!"	1
This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle	0
I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it.  I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon.  There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van.  I can't wait to try it out at the mall	1
I'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo. old son weighs 28 lbs. and should be able to stay in it for alot longer (up to 40 lbs.). The straps are let all the way out and it's still too tight for him. I wouldn't recommend this car seat for chunky babies.	0
I like this product.  It is very stylish and lightweight.  Definitely, I highly recommend to anyone	1
and had problems with it from the beginning. The cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached. Evenflo did replace it after I sent pictures. The shade protector doesn't stay up. I had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter. I wish I had checked safety ratings and reviews before I purchased this product. 	0
The first time I used this excersaucer I was at my sister-in-laws house and she advised to put my six month old in it. At first I was hesitant because I thought it looked too high and kind of unsturdy, compared to my excersaucer deluxe and my excersaucer 3in1. I did end up putting Daireeann in it and she loved it so much that I bought one two days later to take to my after baptism party at a restaurant where I might add was so compact that she did not get bumped into at all.  The only thing is mine did not come with a musical pad at the bottom.  Just a little tip, if you bend the bar back a little bit it will not bump the babies head and the mirror can be flipped facing a way from the baby. I do recommend this one and trust me I am very picky when it comes to my kids so this is a good choice	1
"The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an ""infant""' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up"	0
I love the bather.  I hated the old plastic ones, with this my daughter is more comfortable and doesn't cry when I give her a bath.  I wish I had it with my first child	1
I loved the idea that this car seat was. Then after I bought it I have had problems with it. The handle realse has broken many times. Then the gray handle part  has came apart also. This is has not been safe at all. I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me. I think it was a waste of money	0
We loved the wedge for our little boy.  He slept on it until he outgrew it.  It really helped him breathe better when he had a stuffy nose	1
The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty	0
We had a very fussy baby, and we used these, and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned. I was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape. I considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so I could use it over with child number two	1
"The idea is good...but it does not sit well on oblong toilets. The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus.
Would recommend with round toilet only"	0
"This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins.  Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a ""U"" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings"	1
The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea, but the plastic is very flimsy, and when set in place, it just barely reaches the floor. It's a pretty unstable situation. A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better	0
This monitor is pretty good.  It pick up my little one's little noises so I can get to her before she awakens.  It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars (which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long).  I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service.  I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up.  Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working.  I was able to send it to Fisher-Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days! (no questions asked	1
"It's not just the most icredible piece of junk I ever seen, it is the most DANGEROUS piece of junk I ever seen on the market for kids.
The plastic is very thin, very weak and bends every each way. My daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight. Is SLIDES off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child's weight, which really frightened my girl.
 There's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat. 

I feel soooo stupid to have bought it(("	0
"Pros:
+ 900MHz Communication for less interference and long range

I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product	0
"I just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs.  My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs.  However, gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative.  

We considered this model and the Evenflo ""Top of Stair Gate"".  After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking.  If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit.  Also, why take the chance with safety?  
 
Anyway, here are a few things to consider when installing this item: 
1. I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only.  This is a must do.  It would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall.  
2. Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through, use longer screws than the dinky 1/4"" to 1/2"" screws that are provided in the kit.  I went with 2"" screws for additional strength.  
3) Installation isn't that big of a deal.  Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls.  I found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet.  It wasn't a five minute job but it was not hard at all.  

I'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog. "	1
We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected	0
I love this bra!  It is very comfortable, I hardly notice I have it on.  The soft stretchy material is perfect.  The closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them.  I am glad I bought this nursing bra and I highly recommend it	1
THESE BOWLS ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  THEY DO NOT STAY ON THE TABLE AT ALL! 	0
"This nursing bra is extremely comfortable, ONCE you get it on. It is difficult to get over the chest and back. You practically need 5 hands because it tends to roll under as you're pulling it down your back. I've been wearing it during my pregnancy, I can't imagine how much more difficult it may be to put on when my breasts have grown after the delivery. 

I give it 4 stars though for it's comfort. Once it's on you hardly know you're wearing a bra, and the snaps have been easy to undo and resnap with one hand. Because they are plastic snaps though, I'm wondering how long they will last with 7-8 feedings a day. I will write more on this once the baby arrives (5 more weeks!)"	1
"I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray.  Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl.  Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well.  The littlest one doesn't even stick to that.  None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.

On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them.  Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use.  They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher"	0
I love this bra! I have 2, so that one is always in the wash.  It is the most comfrotable thing I have ever put on.  I bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in. It was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra.  I felt so much better after I put it on for the first time.  I felt like I could breathe again	1
I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose	0
I bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one.  This is the only one I still wear.  Traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes.  I bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when I go out.  I sleep in the Medela bra and wear it around the house.  I am quite large breasted, and I find they have plenty of support.  I even do low-impact aerobics in it.  It is worth every penny	1
"I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal.
I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing.
BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature"	0
This is the most wonderful and handy kit I have ever had. Everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case, it is just wonderful!!!!	1
The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat.  They do come in lovely colors, though	0
"I don't have twins, however I have an infant and a toddler and it works
great for them. I go jogging every morning with the kids and

I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately. I always follow the measuring instructions, but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot, even though I have been practicing to get it right. I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me, who only has a 3 room apartment, the cooling feature is not that useful	0
My Mom always said that the Rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me I found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and I like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so I dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what? My brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old.	1
"I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one....

Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product"	0
We registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby. Upon receiving it as a shower gift, I knew this was going to be great. I love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in. It's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag. This is a must have for every new parent	1
"WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly.
First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write.
But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot.
And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time"	0
I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining.  I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking.  I never could find the place that is was leaking.  So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair.  My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box.  He wanted to use it in the family room.  I love it because it is only 2 pieces.  It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color.  Great price and great size.  I recommend this item	1
"I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better ""mouse trap"".
To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...

we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on. he wouldn't use that potty, but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it. the bjorn is shaped perfectly, with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee. it's so comfy that he will sit and read a book! looks great too. simple and easy to clean	1
Not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected, my child's grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it.  And nobody in this household is overweight	0
"Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and ""practice"". So far so good......"	1
After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno	0
"I purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year.  It was on clearance at Babies R Us for only fifteen dollars.  It was well worth the price.  The only problem I ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal.  I do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it.  The weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark.  

My brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him.  I would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase, if you don't go ahead.  I personally would still make this purchase.  Another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a Sling.  People never gave me those looks with this!"	1
"I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually ""fit"" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.

My daughter was flying to Virginia Beach Virginia to see her husband off to Kuwait where he is serving our country.  She flew alone with two toddlers-one still in diapers.

"I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive.
You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference.
I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety"	0
Finally!  The Joovy is the best double stroller out there-- it was just missing one key element: a cup holder/organizer for parents.  Well, here it is!  I would imagine these will eventually be included with the stroller, but for now- if you buy the stroller- this is a must	1
I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features.  However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward.  I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking.  Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before.  I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem.  I am truly disappointed.  Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears.  I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue.  I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem.  HELP!!!	0
This was a great addition to the Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem--I can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse, have everything discreetly on hand, and not have to lug around yet another bag. Organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and doesn't shift around at all. Have found this product to be really helpful	1
"I bought this doll because at the expensive price, I figured it would be the best.  It definitely is not.  Patty is cute, but that is the only good thing about her.  To fill up her bottles, you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water, then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again.  It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water, no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes.  Then, to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle, where she is almost standing up.  Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms, but Patty will not drink in that position.  Even in the standing up position, most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit.  It takes 5-10 minutes to fill Patty up.  Most children don't have the patience for this and lose interest, as my daughter did.  Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle, only an adult can feed Patty her water.  Then, to make her pee, you must press her thigh very hard.  This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty.  Once I assured her Patty was ok, then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee.  My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier.  At 35 months old, my daughter was not able to fill the bottles, feed Patty or make her pee.  Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty.  So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles.  The whole ""teach the doll to pee"" part of the potty training was lost.  I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead.  Then I e-mailed the company to complain, but of course received no response.  And you can't get a full refund if the doll has been used.  In fact, getting a refund at all is extremely difficult, I have just given up on that.  Don't waste your money.  This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child, which defeats the whole purpose.  Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll.  At least that way, if you don't like it you can return it, unlike Patty"	0
"I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the ""pusher"").   There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder.   I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder.  We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders.  It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink.  :-"	1
Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy.  The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!).  My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old.  And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off.  Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with.  I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts.  I would recommend that you do not buy this item.  I now have to waste more time returning it to the store	0
We love this item. I was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink. This item solved the problem. Highly recommended	1
I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first.  My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor.  It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller.  The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm.  I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off	0
The wedge, along with a vaporizer, helps my three-month-old sleep better at night. sometimes she slides down, but she used to slide around before the wedge, too. Most nights she stays on the wedge just as I positioned her and i think it helps with winter's stuffy noses. It's easy to use and not that expensive.	1
After only 2 months this toy fell apart. My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams. $20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better	0
I am very pleased with this product.It arrived quickly,same as pictured,keeps baby in place insuring a goodnights sleep,im glad the headrest was not elevated,elevated positioners make baby sink into bedding and could cause suffication.again ,im pleased would purchase for any future children i might have	1
"These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because ""they had already replaced the items"". Be careful when ordering from this site"	0
I liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece. My baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so.  I also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider I could adjust the wedges.  One more thing this comes with a mat.  This saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much.  I bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick	1
My son is ten days old. I tried these bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners are a pain in the butt. Once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it, if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again. I changed to Dr. Brown's bottles and my son is having less gas and isn't wearing his food.	0
This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.	1
"So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.  

Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart"	0
"I found one of these at a yard sale ... and it didn't have the suction cup portion.  So, I have no idea if it's a good high chair toy.

However, the toy part gets 5 stars from my daughter!  She has been fascinated by this toy since she was 3 months old.  Now, she is 5 months, and she chooses this toy over all others.  It is her favorite to chew on, bang around, grab, and study.

The black and white handle (that goes into the suction cup) is very easy for her to hold.  She can grasp it with both hands and bring it to her mouth. The mirror/smiley face ball is fun to watch.  The rattle and noises it makes are fun, but not annoying"	1
Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants.  So now it sits in my car fading in the sun.  Save your money	0
I used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space.  The Kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces (i.e. 72 inches total), so if you need extra length, you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length.  The extension was easy to use and is very sturdy.  The gate looks uniformed and you cannot tell it is several separate pieces.  The only 'issue' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door (i.e. 24 inch section with the open/close swing door) or use it as an end piece.  I was not able to continously connect extensions to one another (not sure if I did this incorrectly or not.)  But nonetheless, the extension worked fine and I love my new gate	1
This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only.  If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it.  I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong.  It hardly covers anything.  I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	0
Bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room.  The entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly.  Works well, looks good and feels solid.  Highly recommend for this use	1
"I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima.  Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.  

The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert (""blue"" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.  

I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.  I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options.  :( "	0
"We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate. 
     The elongate was to cover an area of 84"".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.
     The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.
     It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.
     To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.
     I highly recommend this gate."	1
"I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily). Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend. My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me. Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced ""just the pump"" in the pack with a new one. 
Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back. 
Another thing that is happening is my back pack's handles have started wearing down. And I hardly carry them around.
I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump.
I would think twice before buying this"	0
There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate. She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate	1
I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year. 	0
This gate us a lifesaver.  Not only do I pets, I have a very adventurus toddler.  This gate is sturdy and very durable.  It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight.  My living room has a curve to it so it fits great.  A wonderful item.  Thank you	1
"Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.

For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.

We are the fans of the AVENT bottles."	0
"My 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups. She can monitor her snack time, eating as much or as little as she needs. She loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other. 

The only reason I give it 4 stars, is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around. This makes single Cheerios fall out here and there. But, nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl. I've only used them on Cheerios so I can't comment on other snacks (she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair).

She hasn't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers, so that's not a problem for us (at least not yet). We use them all the time and I definitely recommend them"	1
"Like you, I read all the reviews I could of bottles, travel systems, baby swings, cribs, etc etc etc.  I loved the shape of these bottles (very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding), and the concept of the ""ventaire"" system made a lot of sense!  HOWEVER, 2 months into using these bottles, I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts, drying them thoroughly (it's a MUST with these things), and having to ""activate"" BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal; wasting valuable time and energy that should've been spent with my family, catching up on laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and grabbing naps in-between (I also work a full-time job and didn't get home till 6 PM every night).  The WORST of all of it is that if you don't install the vent juuuuuuust so, it leaks...the person (below) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it on right, hasn't met me - I'm 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap!  It's a ""hit or miss"" deal...sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue...water EVERYWHERE!!! (and they're slow leaks too, so it's not like you would notice right away...it took like 30 minutes before showing)  Then I called Playtex to ask them what the problem was, and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material...so, they kindly sent me some new ones.  Well, yeh, THAT didn't work either!!!  It is a GREAT idea, but VERY bad design!!!  I finally threw my hands in the air...and purchased Evenflo's version of the ""angled bottle"" and now I am in HEAVEN!!!  Do yourself, and your time, a favor and don't waste the money"	0

I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently.  My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all.  Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months	0
I love this product! I works graet as a barrier between your little one and whatever surface he or she is on (e.g. a car seat, high chair, stroller etc.).  It really saves you from having to wash your furniture when the little one has bathroom accidents that leak out of their diapers.  It is great for any aged baby/infant/toddler.  It will really make your life easier. I highly recommend it	1
I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used.  They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her.  She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast.  They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages.  Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back	0
"These slings have been an essential part of being parents. Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on. 
If at first you don't succeed, try again later. It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage. Another tip, get moving! The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort. 
Again, baby wearing is such a wonderful thing. I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you. 
We recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain"	1
I thought this cover was horrible.  It doesn't cover enough area of the cart.  It's difficult to put on because of all the ties.  I couldn't even get the harness to fit right.  Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic, you can put them on the cart with one hand, and it completely covers the cart, even the big ones at Costco	0
"I love my New Native sling! I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile.  My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling.  He loves it too, whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in.  I've even nursed while walking around..in many places: Costco, Disneyland, Walmart! Very discreet.  I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag, so I always have it.  No bulky rings or padding.  I'm buying them for all my family with babies! I love it, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.  A must have item!

You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.

I used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son (that doesn't overlap the mattress) and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times. I remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that I was panicked and thought he had suffocated. I was extremely happy when I discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed. She is now two and I haven't had one problem with it. I at one point had three on her bed. I went down to two as I pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open. I have not had one problem with them. I take them off her bed and use them when we travel. I can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween. I wish they had these when my son was younger : 	1

"My 3 1/2 year old son finally graduated into his ""big boy bed"" with our move into our first house.  That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib.  We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there.  The weird thing about it, however, is that the pressure bars ""POP!"".  You'll get the rail in place on the bed, push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green' to indicate they're locked... then after a while they'll go ""POP!"" and begin to inch their way UP into the 'red zone', meaning ""unlocked"".  It's weird!  It doesn't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed, but it's a loud noise that, until he was used to it, would wake him out of a dead sleep.  All in all, I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds.  It's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night"	1
I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same.  Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on.  Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart.

We have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece.  They are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market.  They are made well, stand up to a lot of washing, and are soft and comfortable for baby.  The dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch.  Note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months, not for a newborn.  We started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets.   Two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night- all you need over pj's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable.  A great night's sleep for all!	1

I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue.	0

I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected.  The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but I don't quite get how to adjust this.  It also says that there is a blanket.  Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here.  I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does.  At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1/2 inches thick.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby's sleep problems	0

"1) Like others here, my charges do not last more than 5 hours.  The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger).

2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  ""Cycling"" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.  Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal.

Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated.  My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story ""box"" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.  So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery.

Poorly designed (operator interface, controls, directions and trouble-shooting), poorly engineered (poor reception, enormous static, fast battery drain) and poorly manufactured (apparent faulty parts and lack of quality) product"	0
What a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter.  When my son wants me to play a game, puzzle or play on the floor.  I just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time.  I have also found it helpful when I fold laundry.  I can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what I am doing.  It props the baby's head up just enough--better than just laying flat on the floor. The lounger also cradles the baby.  I wish that I had found this when my son was a baby.  I recomend this lounger to every new mommy. 	1
"I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday. (only available in store at Babies R Us).  It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children.  Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back.  

Pro:
-The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside.
-No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference.
-Easy to setup.
-Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony)
Cons:
-Controls are not very straightforward.
-The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated.
-The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on.
-The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.  With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the ""off"" mode.  You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on.  Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red.

"My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child, and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed.  We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in, but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage.  

This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors, but you certainly don't get what you pay for here.  

Pros:

1.  You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range (see cons for a further explanation)

Cons:

1.  The biggest complaint I have is the battery life.  Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting, you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge.  You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge.  This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night.  The nursery unit is even worse, as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in.  Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me.  Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times.

2.  I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit.  They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range.  This required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct.

3.  The range is not ideal.  I have a 2800 square foot, 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit.  Granted, the units were about as far away as they can be in our house, but considering this distance was only about 60 feet, I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house.

4.  As other reviewers have noted, the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper.  Since the speaker is always on, you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit.  Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume (i.e. if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib).  Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room.  

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.  We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a $100 baby monitor, although I'm sure I would be much happier with a different product.  

If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time, then this product would probably suffice, although I'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well"	0
This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it. 	1
I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors.  The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery.  And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it.  I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out.  There is tons of static and extra noise.  Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much.  Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!!  Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend!	0
"I got this tray for my son's daily rides in the car, and it has been terrific! He can eat on it, put his sippy cup into the cup holder, and be totally independent. He can also play on it - cars, crayons, etc., and it holds his books too.

After approximately 9 months of constant use, it cracked. (It is very stiff, of course, but I don't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked). Worth the money as far as I am concerned."	1
"I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:
To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. 
The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. 
In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case.
So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. 
I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system."	0

We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..	0
We purchased this gate for an odd sized opening, because it is expandable.  It attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side.  We have the gate in a very high traffic opening, and it is not only easy to open and close, but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out.  In the evening when the kids go to sleep, we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side.  I love it so much, I'm buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have. Works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also. Quality, durable product.  I definitely recommend it. Target is the only place I have found this gate	1
"This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.  
At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.

After checking out all of the boppys, I decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers.  I have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it!  It is so soft, and I have washed it a few times with no problems (I haven't put it in the dryer, though).  It does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up, etc., of course, since it is not a waterproof cover.  However, I was not expecting it to be waterproof, and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof, so it's not a big deal to me.  Since I have the plain white boppy, nothing shows through, but this might be an issue for decorated boppys	1
I got this to make sterilizing easier. I'm not sure it does. It is kind of a pain. Cartoonish in appearance, cheap looking, cheap feeling,not nearly enough room for what you have to put in, you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things. Water does spill like crazy from the lid. Does it really sterilize? I hope so! I can't tell. Air vent bottles air dry, but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have. Why? I don't know, the steam? Metal of heating unit isn't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don't get cut! I was VERY disappointed! For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality! You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure!	0
very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row	1
Both my children get Thrush very easy so I purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use. My kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards. If my kids keep getting thrush, obviously this product does not work	0
I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant, and so far I've been very pleased. I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I'm out running errands. There are just a few parts, so assembly, disassembly and cleaning is very easy. But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds, but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby.	1
We just learned in Parenting class (and I checked with my pediatrician) that you don't need to sterlize bottles, nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher. So save some money and don't get this!	0
I have had the Harmony for seven months and use it about 2-3 times a day.  It it still working great with all the original parts.  I have not had to buy replacement anything.  I do admit I recently tried another pump. It was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby.  With in two days I called the company, I got a refund and am back to my Harmony.  This is a great pump and I am so happy that we bought it.  Stop searching and buy this pump	1
this product is a mess. i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50$ down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun	0
This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces.  It is also more stable than others we used.  We like it	1
I received this steralizer as a gift. If I had to do all over again I would have never put it on my registry. The steralizer is messy; everytime I lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere. In addition I have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out... there has to be a better way	0
i love this simply designed, sturdy potty. my son loves it which is most important. he has no trouble sitting down on it; no pinching, no crampedness, no tipping over. the well sized arm rests help him up & down & the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over! having only 2 pieces & no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean. the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on & read books! great product, great price. i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother's.	1
I was given this as a gift, so thankfully I didn't waste my money on it.  This sterilizer is so messy and awkward, that I can not recommend it at all.  The metal pan started corroding after only a week.  Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop.  All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty, so I can't imagine how it could possibly clean.  Horrible product	0
I  bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features.....overall I am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it....but few things I wish it had is ....one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention.Overall for the price it is good	1
This is the worst nursing pad that I've tried.  It slips out of place, and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it.  I found myself with wet bras all the time!  These pads are terrible!  I recommend the Lansinoh brand. 	0
I purchased the extention kit for the Superyard XT Play Gate to go with the Play Gate that I purchased. It works great for my new Pomeranian Puppies.  The Play Yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe.  It will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves. The fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so I can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be. I love this item and I am very happy I purchased it.  I feel the gate is great for animals, I have not used it with Children as of this time	1
These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).	0
I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it. The extra extensions you can buy for it are great. I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room. I found it to be very durable and sturdy. When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in. As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set. You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose. I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though. It's sturdy but probably not for that age. It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside. I'd recommend this highly	1
I received a box as a shower gift, and they worked okay, unless I changed them a lot though, they ended up leaking. I was resigned to just living with wet spots, until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try. I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn't arry them, but they really need to. These things absolutely do not leak, they hold tons of liquid	0
My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo.  I love these sleep blankets, the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece.  I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits.  I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep, your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers	1
After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enoug	0
Once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks I was glad I bought these halo sleepsacks.  They are made from awesome fabrics and I like that the zipper ends at their feet (for easy diaper changes).  I highly recommend these to any new mom (or experienced mom).  It left me assured that my daughter didn't wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head.  She is a active baby in her crib. :	1
After spending over $30 for this item, we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across.  A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong.  Would not purchase again or recommend to others	0
There is a place for everything in this drying station. I use wide mouth bottles and it's a little tight on space, but it works great for me. It's convenient on the counter when I have to grab a bottle for the baby.	1
We own two of these and they have never been easy to use.  We tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat.  We have kept it though.  We bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off.  We would not buy this one again.  We do have large carseats - they are both Britax Marathons	0
I really like this.  I have had some water leakage on the counter but not enough to really make a mess.  I think sometimes the excess water is going to get through the cracks no matter what. My bottles fit just fine, I use the Avent bottles. 	1
waste of money.  does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this	0
This is a great organizer.  I read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until I received this one.  It is great!  We use the Avent bottles and they, and all of their parts, fit very well.  There are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers.  It did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter, but once we mastered that, all is well	1
Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily	0
We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...	1
"We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks.  We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit.  I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off.  An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony.  We regret not reading the reviews before buying it.

If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for"	0
"My son is [...] and aside from getting too big for his crib, my sister is having a baby and needs it. I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his ""crib attachment,"" but this bed made it easy as pie. It's adorable, sturdy and fun. My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we've never had a problem (we've had it for a month). He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying ""choo choo."" It's just been great....I'm so glad we spent the money"	1
"Due to the fact that you can't give 0 stars, I had to choose a 1, otherwise it would have been a big fat 0!!! We bought this mattress when I was pregnant, thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong. A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping, mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers, no toys, nothing sharp, etc. Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter, and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out. My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!! Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do!!!

My first son had a race car bed which wasn't made very well. We moved him to a big bed when our second child was ready for the toddler bed. Well, we decided to get rid of the old car bed and get him his own Thomas bed for his 2nd birthday since he is OBSESSED with Thomas. BEST DECISION EVER! It is SO much better made that the other plastic beds! And I'm so glad I read the reviews...the springs from the crib fits PERFECTLY in the THomas bed (and it's pretty strong because I can lay in the bed with him at night if I have to). It is really worth the money. If you are looking into a cute toddler bed for a boy, I'd skip the other cute beds and go straight to this one! We all love it	1
I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.	0
"So many convertibles car seat to choose from but the Britax Marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum.

I was very pleased that the Marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness. No other seat that I reviewed offered this feature. I also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap.

My son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his Peg Perego Primo Viaggio.

(...)They offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color I wanted in stock. 

I believe I made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments"	1
"I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.

What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable ""chucks"" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.  

While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable. "	0
This lock gives piece of mind. It's easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open. It's sturdy and doesn't require drilling into any cabinetry. I started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house	1
The first one of these I had came apart at every seam the first time I washed it.  I returned it and got another I was pleased with until about the 6th washing, and now IT is starting to fall apart.  They just don't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure.	0
I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort. 	1
I really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in, however the quality of the material is less than desirable. The cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier. I expected some shrinkage, but it seems excessive. I still use the covers but am disappointed overall. The material is not very soft so admittedly I will look around for other products	0
Our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat.  We love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding.  I was looking forward to the reclining feature as well, but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature	1
I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating	0
We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair. I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it. This one has a higher back, reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable (the one I have is better than the one shown. I bought it at babiesrus). It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray. My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere. 	1
I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore, they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad. i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great, unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily. and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white	0
I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we're out strolling in the sun.  It does a pretty good job; only my son's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined (my only beef about the product), but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem.  I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable.  I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached.  I think the side pouches are an excellent plus.  I am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family	1
I bought this but it's junk. My husband and I have both tried it on ourselves and can't get it to register of 95 degrees. That's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one	0
I tried to use my other kiddopotamus shade with my 16 mt old the other day while taking a stroll on the beach. He would not hear of it! He wanted to see out!! I searched the web trying to find another shade to cover him - This was the answer!! I did not want to pay more than 20.00 for the shade and at 15.00 this is a bagin!! I have found it extemely easy to use on my baby jogger. One windy day it did blow in but that was OK with me because I knew it was also blocking the wind from my son's face. If you are looking to extend your stroller's shade area this is the product for you!! I  only wish I had found it before I got rid of my Inglesina stroller because I could not move the shade forward to block the son from my fair skinned child	1
"Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart.

For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.  

Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.  "	0
My son LOVES this toy, although I think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color. He is 10.5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy. A good buy and will keep them busy	1
This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat.	0

I've had the Hippo faucet cover for over six months and I think it's great! My son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt. It is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise I think it's worth it!  The only problem I found with the Hippo cover is that it doesn't really dispense bubble bath well. 	1
It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. :	0
This thing cracks us up!  We ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it.  He can play with it, but its secure enough that he can't pull it off.  It was also an absolute necessity for us - now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime, it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet.  It puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time.            	1
I tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me. They were hot and of course they also showed right through any top I was wearing. I had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention	0
We had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to Disney World came. To be honest I didn't know what to do because she wouldn't go potty on the big potty.  I felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her.  A full week at Disney World was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around. Then I found this at babies r us!!! What a little blessing to little ones.  It fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty. Plus it fit perfect in my Wendy Bellissimo diaper bag.  I carry it everywhere!! I don't leave home without it.  Thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to Disney World so much better!!	1
"Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position. The wheels have a mind of their own. The handles make it hard to go up curbs. Hard to close up, need both hands and foot.

i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.  (after she was diagnosed, we were given zantac... but still used this as well!)  it's a true godsend.  we'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content!!!  this works far better than mylicon.  it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price.  we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	1
"We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly.
Our children are 2.5 and 10 months.  Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support.  Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric.  The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when  my two kids were in it.

Works great. We tried other brands of Gripe Water, which didn't seem to do much. Something about Baby's Bliss does the trick	1
"But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)
Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore"	0
"This is amazing I tell ya, Seriously I've doubted it since my first child, and then my twins ( never got it ) with them, just assumed it was some Hype.

anyway her screams were out of no where, she wasn't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you. and sometimes that wasn't good enough.  she cried and cried and waled. it really drove us all bonkers. she isn't a pacifyer baby either, so we were at loss.


she was obviously really gassy, she got hiccups ALOT. She's breastfed and we couldn't figure out what it was, that maybe I was eating? 

Sure enough today we tried it, and she's peacefully sleeping without stirring. I recomend it 110%. My husband got it at his work with a 20% discount, I'm so relieved"	1
The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price	0
"I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie.  She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds.  And she seems comfortable in the seat too.  The seat snaps into two positions, a reclined position and a sitting position.  Additionally, you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward.

I did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood WHILE we were using this swing.   When the power came back on, I tried all the different switches to turn it on and it didn't work, then later on, it finally did work.  This swing has so many switches on it and I admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform.  That said, I don't know if the failure was user error or a quality issue.  It appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so I think it was me.

Another user cites instability of the stand on this swing.  I have had no problem with this as I tested it carefully before putting baby in.  Also, we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time, so we haven't had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup.  This might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot.

I personally like the fact that the mobile, the rocking, and the sounds are independent of each other, so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with.  I LOVE the fact that you can use batteries OR the wall outlet to power this thing.  Thank GOODNESS for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore, but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity isn't available.

I would recommend this swing, but I would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it"	1
I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women	0
My two year old son, loves this talking phone he carries the thing everywhere.  We love the time and quailty that he spends playing with this wonderful toy	1
We haven't yet put the bed together so it might be great but I gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it didn't!  This was a common complaint in reviews.  Two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped.  It did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well.  There is a phone number to call if parts are damaged.  We'll do that soon.  I'll update this review if everything is fixed	0
We also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller (limosine style) and our pack-n-play.  In addition to bugs, it keeps leaves, etc. from falling into the play pen.  My in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one's sold these days.  The netting also fit that but not as snugly	1
We received this item as a Xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken.  My two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor.  The legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item.  We were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a Step 2 product. 	0
I actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby's cradle (we have two cats and didn't want them to nap in it while the baby wasn't in it).  I've used it once for my Pak n' Play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood.  Since it was such a nice day I let her nap in in the stroller(it fully reclines) with netting covering the entire stroller.  I feel, that for such a low price, this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for	1
"Unless your baby has very long legs, they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water. My son is 1 and cannot reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat. However, he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when I am trying to buckle him into his seat.

Also, I have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it, and I am not finding a way to put new water into it. The floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated - and it's kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat"	0
The Pack and Play Netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your Pack and Play outside.  The netting keeps the bugs out! It is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag.  It also fits easily over the Graco Pack and Plays	1
"Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child.  This gate is all look and no function.  It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it.  If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work.  I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4"" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together.  I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6"" then drilling two holes about 4"" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something.  Good luck!!"	0
Diaper Genie Stage 2 Refills have helped us eliminate odors in our twins room.  Easy to install and discard.  Our one year old twins use a lot of diapers and they have been eating solid foods for 6 months.  But you have to install them tightly on the Diaper Genie.  If the refill wabbles on its place, then you need to see what's wrong before starting using it.  Otherwise the odors will come out.  The real fact is that it works!!.  And you know, its great to be at home with my twins in their room and have everything tidy.  We used to throw the diapers in the bathroom garbage can, but after a few hours we couldn't stand going in there.  Note: I am the father, and just spend a couple of hours a day with them... My wife could tell you more on how she loves this diaper genie	1
I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide.  Within one week of use, the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable.  I am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type.  This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for	0
As I am not personally using this, I can only pass on what I have been told.  It does a great job of trapping odors and making terrific sausages which are easily thrown away	1
I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!!  Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up.	0

"I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.

PROBLEMS: 

1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory.
2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks. 
3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week.
4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing.
5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said "" don't know."" 

Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer. 

My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at ""stadium seating"" strollers."	0
"We received the original co-sleeper as a gift.  We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard.

The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up.  The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard.  The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb.  Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15.  The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard.  The width is 28"" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29"" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31"".

There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy.  (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens)  This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual.

I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly.  Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out"	1
"I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal ""cheap"" single stroller, instead.   "	0
"Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly.  I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble.  Assemble is probably too strong a word, there is no actual assembly or tools involved.  As for the weight, maybe 15 pounds, certainly nowhere near 50.  

The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn't really need to use them.   

Basically, if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern, don't let that stand in the way of choosing this item.  "	1
"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out. 
Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well."	0
"I've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he's been with us, but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and I a bit more space.  I have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer.  We've run into a few problems:  First we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we've had to switch bed frames for now.  Second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since I'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing I didn't want to have to reach in and pick him up.  We solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses.  Now he has a softer surface to snooze on and I can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him... we'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he's a bit bigger so he doesn't fall out, but for now it works!  Hope this helps!

*** I'm adding this a few months after use- I like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed, but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times... still prefer to have him in the bed with us!"	1
"I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews.  I'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later.    
Problems:
The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull  
The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park) 
The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios
The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six ""buttonholes"" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag
The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right
The shades are very small and next to worthless
The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller

For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel.  It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.  If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience.  A shame"	0
"I think this is a great quality product, and I love the idea of it. However, I find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it. It's not very soft and it's just so big for him right now. I can get him to sleep in it only if he's completely zonked out beforehand. 
I think the mini co-sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning. The original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it.
I do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many, many times"	1
I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second	0
I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard.  My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it.  The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment.  So that's very easy to clean.  The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots.  The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening.  The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl.  The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!  	1
I bought this stroller for when we had our second child.  My children are 19 mo. apart.  I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it.  This one is definitely not the same.  For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.  	0
"I ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects.  This seat is perfect!  My almost 2.5 year old daughter took to it immediately.  It's not too small (she's very tall) but not too big (she has a petite bottom).  It cleans up easily, and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her.  The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet, and has handles for the child to steady him/herself.  The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning.  There are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it.  The lid closes ""just like mommy's potty"" and becomes a wide flat step stool.  Perfect product"	1
If you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you.  But just try turning and especially sharp turns--you'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way. 	0
Very easy to use, and comfortable, it didn't bother my daughter when she was asleep. Stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be. Easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night. Washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year	1
"My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.

Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great.."	0
"I replaced our old Ocean Wonders Aquarium soother with this Rainforest Waterfall version about a month and a half ago.  The Aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music, but I was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time.  With the Aquarium, I had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep.  Not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all I want to do is fall back asleep.  I had read that the Waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes, so I thought I'd check it out.

The soother has 3 different length settings: lights, music/sounds, and movement for 6 minutes; lights and music/sounds for 12 minutes; music/sounds only for 18 minutes.  There are 3 settings for the sounds: rainforest sounds without music; rainforest sounds and lullabies; rainforest sounds and classical music.  There are 3 volume settings as well.

I have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and I rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time.  She almost instantly settles down once the music starts.  If I happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she's still awake, she'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own.  And I'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as I try to fall back asleep.

My only complaint is that the lights seem REALLY bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep.  I ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit.  The baby can't see the critters, but since I don't have them set to move, it's not really a big deal.

Despite the bright lights, we're happy with this soother"	1
"This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink.
And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail.
The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken"	0

I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive.  Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for.  Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in.  I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk!  I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie.  I hope this will work out much better	0
"I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up, and not just the sides.  This is also sometimes refered to as a ""4-sided changing pad"" since all 4 edges are raised.

It seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser, effectively converting the dresser to a changing table.  The only reason I didn't rate this higher was that it didn't include a non-skid pad on the bottom of the pad.  Also, it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover.

Next, I need to order some covers for it, since the baby doesn't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface.  I am not sure which covers to order"	1
"I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.  

After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off.  I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half.  I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First.  They only had the blue top without the spring.  The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top"	0
"My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.) 

My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem"	1
This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail	0
The Snuzzler works well for our small baby in his Graco Metrolite stroller.  It supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it. 	1
"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.  

Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.

I would not recommend this product"	0
i like this car seat. it is very soft for a bab	1
"Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided.

Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down. If the smell isn't a problem for you, go for it. But if you're picky with the smell, research something else"	0
This carseat is a good value.  The pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow.  I did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that's expected in a 4 month old.  It reclines far enough that her head doesn't fall forward and it's so simple to adjust the straps.  Overall very nice carseat for the money I spent.   	1
"I was very excited to finally recieve this stroller, but after I put it together (which was pretty simple), it was very heavy and bulky to handle. I was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon.  I bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution. 
I was not able to load it in the back of mt SUV due to the size and weight, and it is very long and hard to steer. Anyone considering the Ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney.
It does not accomodate my Evenflo carrier either, so I would have needed to also purchase the Graco carseat.
I am returning the stroller to Amazon today"	0
I got one of these for my baby shower I loved it so much I went back and bought another one.  Very easy to use. I just put my baby in it before she's going to sleep for the night. There is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack. Puts your mind at ease, no loose blankets in the crib!! Also, reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights	1
I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item!  These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter.  I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad.

I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser, which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience.  I was very disappointed.

"We purchased the Fisher-Price Open Top Take-Along Swing a few months ago for our daughter, and have been very pleased with its quality and performance. We haven't had any problems with the operation of the swing, even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs. It runs on C batteries, which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use.

This swing has several great features. It folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed. It pops right in the trunk for trips to Grandma's house, and I've also used it quite a bit in the backyard when I want to do yard work. Having a 5 year-old in the house, I also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room. Being only a flat 5 foot tall with short (and admittedly weak) arms, I have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it, but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one-handed while the baby's in the other arm.

Though I'm pleased with this swing, I'd really recommend it in *addition* to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one. The compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast-moving, unlike the slow, soothing motion of taller swings. My daughter seems to like the Take-Along Swing just fine when she's in an alert, awake mood. When she's tired, however, it just goes too quickly, even on the lowest setting, and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down. I'd originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full-sized Graco swing, but we've ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs. Overall, I'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going to have one swing in your house, you might consider whether you'd be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep, or this little one that entertains during those fussy, bouncy times"	1

1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly.
2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break.
3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.

Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it. As for the locking mechanism, it's annoying, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse.

This gate would not be safe for kids"	0
These are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself. Whenever we are out at a restaurant I just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table. Who knows what they wipe those tables with?! This is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on	1
If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.	0
These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible. 	1
This gate is absolutely worthless.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  It was difficult to install and is very flimsy. I have it at the top of the stairs and I don't trust that it will hold at all. I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one.	0
Love these.  I use them everywhere.  I really can't imagine not having them, since my son throws down all plates and napkins still. 	1
This is the flimsiest gate ever.  To boot it is not cheap.  I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate.  I had to use nails and duck tape.  The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together.  Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good.  So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate.  So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled.  This gate isn't even worth $1.0	0
I wouldn't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a Table Topper for each of them.  The self-sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place, creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre-schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant-table germs.   I wish I had thought of these!!  They're a great invention for families on the go	1
Hard to install, ridiculously confounding installation directions, and when you're done, it's flimsy. Don't waste your money	0
This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per...	1
This gate is horrible to try to open and close... don't try to pinch pennies when it's your little one's safety and YOUR convenience at stake.  Buy the Configure Gate instead... you'll be glad you did.  It is well worth every penny... this one isn't worth a thing	0
"I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.  

This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot.

I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to ""nap"" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.  

Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff.

Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!"	1
"I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe.  Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever.  The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.  

This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).  

We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional."	0
"We really enjoy this travel system.  Having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car.  Being off of work for 3 months, I didn't have to feel cooped at home when I could easily take my daughter to the store or the park.  As big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers, we still prefer to take it, because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath, the seat-back folds down (allowing sleep or diaper changes), and it has THREE cupholders, 2 side pockets that can hold other items (burp cloth, bottled water, toys), and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone.  The basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot.  The stroller fits in the trunk of our compact Saturn 4-door, or if necessary, in the front passenger seat (upside-down to fit in the wide wheels, which are anyway relatively easy to remove).  The loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand, so I can push it if I happen to be carrying my daughter.  The stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street, on paved park paths, and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach (it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand, if you go backwards).  In her car seat in the stroller, she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies, although I found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow.  We took the whole system on a 10-day trip, which included a flight out of town, and I felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born.  At 6 months, she has just outgrown the car seat (but she's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight), but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up.

Drawbacks, all fairly minor:  Not easy to close stroller one-handed.  Wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top, so I'm always banging the wheels on something.  It takes a few minutes to remove/replace washable carseat cover, but this is probably necessary due to the straps.  As with any carseat, we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car; we had many questions on installation, particularly since our car lacked the LATCH system.  We purchased a second base so we didn't have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter's car"	1
"These retail now for $229 at BRU. Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit!

This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego!  All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :).

I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store?

It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too!

Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2.

Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price"	0
I received this as a baby shower gift from my Mom and love it! It is so easy to manuever, you can do it with one hand. The stroller has ample space for bags, purse, etc. below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items. The drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus. The material is so pretty and the colors are great. The best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby, should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather. I would highly recommend this item.	1
The design is pretty narrow. My 3-4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described. The product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry. Unless you have a very small and quiet baby, otherwise it is not a wise choice	0
My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though)	1
As the other reviewer stated, the seal appears to be faulty on this, and it stopped working almost straight away.  I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well	0
I think that this is a great stroller for traveling.  I have a 4 year old and she loved riding in it.  We used it on our Vacation to disney World and it was wonderful for all of the walking we had to do.  It fit in tight spaces and was very easy to manuever.  It was light weight and easy to use. Overall I am glad that I had this great strolle	1
I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn't turn it off. I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it. A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof	0
"This seems like a really sturdy, lightweight stroller. I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.)
 
The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo. 

The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off. 

Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6"" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase. 

I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into."	1
I love the idea of this product. Like many of the other reviewer's I don't have the regular traditional style crib. Our crib converts to a toddler bed. This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs. I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one's that are more with the current styles of cribs, like mine's.	0
"We've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old; she's now 2 1/2 and we've never had any problems with it.  This is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall, park, etc.    The sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too.  We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that.  It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do.  For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option.  I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light ""quick outing"" stroller to keep in the car. "	1
This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days	0
I love this bath tub!  We were not happy with my son's infant bath tub, so we were anxious to move into this one!  It fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs.  When you're done with it, it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry.  The best part is that we'll be able to deflate it and store it easily.  It's also great for traveling	1
I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work. 	0
I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath	1
Product is not worth the money. Made the bassinet very unstable	0
We bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats.  He was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly couldn't handle the full size version.  This tub is a perfect in between option.  The only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub	1
"These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.

There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height.  We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.

It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces.  What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child"	0
My son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year. It is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub doesn't accomdate the rings. In fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand. Ours has withstood a year of use so far and we'll be using it with the next baby too	1

I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily	1
I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	0
This is a great item.  I paid 17.95 for it at Walmart though!  Get it there	1
This product was terrible.  First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats!  Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt.  The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it.  The stroller is a piece of junk.  When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match.  Do not buy	0
"This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a ""bunkie"" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a ""big boy"" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)"	1
I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing, because of the shower and spa feature. But the shower is so hard to use, it's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time. You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling, beacause it's just not positiioned right, it sits too high up, and she just looks uncomfortable on it. You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit. It wasn't worth $40, the sling, and the spa and shower unit isn't useful or helpfula t all	0
"I am a pretty picky shopper, but I have fallen in love with this product.  My now 6 1/2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place I could ever get her to sleep comfortably.  She still sleeps in it (at 18 pounds, it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out).  There is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies.  

Save the money you'd spend on a co-sleeper, swing or a bassinet and try this instead.  I buy it for every baby shower I attend. "	1
"When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great.  It had everything.  

Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came.  I am so glad that I did.  The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.  

The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling.  It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub.  In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else."	0
We love this glider as does our 6 week old!  She has reflux so this has been a life saver!  She sleeps in it and enjoys the gentle gliding back and forth as she falls alsleep.  We swaddle her and tuck her, turn on the side to side glide and set her womb bear on the edge of the glider....off to slumber land she goes...We highly recommend this	1
We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money	0
Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow.  My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product.  At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing.  I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.  I would say my money is well spent	1
"In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless. 

1) The ""spa"" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby

2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.

3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.

All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same"	0
"This product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night, especially since she can't kick off the blankets. I highly recommend it.  Sizing is different than baby r us. I'm probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought I'd provide info.

"I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after ""squeezing"" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold. 
I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.
It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub"	0
I haven't been able to find the sizing info. for the sleepsacks on this site, so I called the Right Start (they also carry them but for $24.99) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds.    Just thought I'd put this info. out there for everyone - hope it helps	1
I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn.  I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse.  Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it.  Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick.  My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath.  The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it.  I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out.  Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated.  Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40.  So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-	0
As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face	1
This is my first amazon review b/c I feel this is such junk I had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed.  Usually I can find something to do with a junky product, but this is so junky I can't do anything with it, I might as well have just washed the money down the drain.  The fabric is rough, too rough for a new baby, the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable.  As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it, once filled it sinks.  How can it support a baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks.  You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger, the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break.  Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later.  I have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs, seats and supports for the tub, some I disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi	0

I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would.  First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub.  The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it?  Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub.  I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic.  Don't waste your money.  Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief	0
I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems.  Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months.  When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me.  But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20.  It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience	1
I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all!  This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over.  It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath.  It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit	0
We purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping. She always woke up congested and strangled. Since we started using the wedge she hasn't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now	1
"Seems like a good idea for a seat.  I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat.  But the opening is just too small.  It is not the lack of a deflector.  I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one.  This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time.  This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty.  Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy.  We are shopping for a replacement now.  I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.  We just teach him to point ""it"" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine"	0
I would like to ditto (and thank!) the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers.  After reading her review, I purchased the covers from cvs.com . Then I thought about checking at Walgreen's, and sure enough, they carry them (same price as CVS, 40 for $5.99).  I just picked up a box today.  So I will soon have a bunch of covers, but I don't care.  I just love this thermometer.  I actually have the one with the light on it.  Outstanding product	1
my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now.	0
     this stroller is the BEST 250.00 that i have spent in a long time!!  we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters (aged 16 mo's and 3) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood.  depending on weather and moods sometimes we'd do 3 laps.  it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills.  plus, i can actually JOG or even RUN!!!  i can't tell who loves it more, me, the dog, or my girls.  it's light, easy to steer, worth EVERY penny.  plus, i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls.  oh, and it was incredibly easy to put together	1
"I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:

- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.
- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).
- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.
- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over. 

The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.  

Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand"	0
We had the forerunner (Diaper Genie 1).  No matter what I did, it still stunk.  I would add baking soda after poopy diapers, line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners.  It always smelled like poop!!  One day it broke, so we looked for a replacement.  I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one, but we thought we would give it a try.  It's amazing.  My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench!!!  Also, it's so easy.  No twisting.  Just put the diaper thru the trap door.  It's easy to load and change cartridges.  This is definately a great buy!!! 	1
We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son.  Boy, were we wrong.  The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart.  So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again.  He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.   	0
"I love the plug-in feature, there's been many times I've left the swing on (have to rush to change a diaper and left it on). True, it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls. 

The swing isn't incredibly fast, but for my 2 month old, it's worked well. There are two volume levels for the music, but I've only used the lowest setting."	1
"this idea is nice but, the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap.  next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray, and that is really hard to get off, by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash.

This high chair is so easy to put together and use.  My grand-daughter loves this chair, the music and toys on top occupy her.  I like how it changes height and reclines.  My grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months.  The recline position came in handy!  I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family	1
It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it.  Now the bad!  The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy.  Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it.  First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off.  At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing.  Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child	0
I love this chair, and so does my 6 month old.  It's super easy to clean, to recline the seat, or to adjust the height.  The toy that comes with it is cute, too - I love the music it plays	1
"I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so.  I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units.  The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem.  Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.

I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them"	0
I bought this chair for my third child and wish I would've had it for the first two as well. It is easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean. I like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age. I love the wheels because I could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner.  The one hand release on the tray is a dream for Moms who could use eight hands! My son seems to enjoy the toys, too. I only wish it came with extra trays	1
"We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35"" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food"	0
Love this tub. The hammock attachment works well for small infants	1
"We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby. By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom. She was hurt pretty bad. No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight. 
Please beware of how unsafe this product is. Not at all what is advertised."	0
We love this tub & still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old.  The incline position is great when they aren't quite ready to sit on their own.  We used to just place this over our kitchen sink & give her baths there. Now, we place it inside our regular bathtub because she isn't quite ready to be in the big tub yet.	1
"My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him.
I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.  
 Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his ""own body weight"" DOES NOT ""keep baby in place"" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor."	0
I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors	1
I received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is. I have a large baby. He was almost 17 lbs at four months old. So his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age. He also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs. He didn't seem very happy in it. It may work better if you have a smaller baby, but the chubbier ones will    never fit for long	0
I have two children now, and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born.  I have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car, and nothing worked 100% of the time.  This however does.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it's very inexpensive	1
"I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item!  When it first came out, I purchased one for my son (he was around six months old at the time).  He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back, extending his arms behind him, and straightening his legs, so I returned it.  By the time I had my second child (a girl), Bumbomania had kicked in, and these seats were EVERYWHERE.  I began to think that my son's experience was a fluke, and I purchased another one for my daughter.  Low and behold, she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY!  So I returned the second Bumbo as well, but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children ""may"" be able to get out of the seat.  In conclusion, although the Bumbo may work great for some - BEWARE!  If you have little Houdinis like I do, this product is simply not safe"	0
It works really well.  It's stable (the little guy is trying to climb) and holds a lot	1
"the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new ""channel"" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one"	0
"This is one of the best on the market. Looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books. A ""Must Buy"""	1
i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone	0
Finally! A big, spacious, nice looking toy box!!  I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor, but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there!  The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up.  The drawers on the bottom are small, but hold a few things, and don't take anything away from the big interior of the box.  It makes the box look more sofisticated!!  Love the new colors and design.  Thanks Little Tikes!	1
I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.   	0
It fits our Baby Trend car seat, hooks easily to the LATCH anchor points, and in our mid-size sedan, leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side	1
I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant.  I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work!    I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in.  I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on.  I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction!  I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on.  I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me!  I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it.  A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare	0
"This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old. He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror. He also loves the music, which calms him down when he is crying. The music is soothing and doesn't grate on our nerves even though we've heard it many times. 

My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play. It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times. There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme.

All in all, a good product that I would buy again.

By the way, the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle"	1
I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked, my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work. I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus. My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy	0
All rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff, there's no avoiding it.  We squirt them til empty at the end of every bath.  My kids love the net and little fish, as well as the other toys.  No problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we've had it over 2 years. 	1
"My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.  My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other ""baby"" toys.  This toy is just not that interesting.  I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all"	0
"Used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt.

Purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here. I liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions. 

While using the wrap isn't intuitive (ie watch the dvd) it's easy to learn.

My back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap (tummy to tummy) than in traditional front carriers. I wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise.

Only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so I have to hold baby's head while I rock her to sleep. 

Would recommend this product, great price too"	1
"My daughter really LOVES this BUS.  Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it.  She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them.   
The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up.  My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm.  But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since. "	0
"Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust.

For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage.

Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces). 

If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles).

I absolutely love this product & would never consider another bottle"	1
I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one	0
I have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs. The gates are attached to the walls. I have not had any problems with the either gate. For those of you searching for a gate for a dog, the gate works will with by 70 pound Boxer.	1
I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it	0
I was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib.  Nothing was inside except the sheets and baby.  As you can imagine, this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails.  So, number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over-cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper!  I still worry about SIDS but I feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy.  Highly recommend	1
It's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached.  Effectively serves its purpose, but for nearly 16 bucks?!!  Puleeeeeeeease	0
This is great for young babies..once my son became more active (which is when it's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it's very thin - unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w/ a crib set.  I think that is the only flaw but I will definitely use it again for my next infant/baby	1
My daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times!  I am returning it first thing in the morning.  I should have never let her on it a second time.  If she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over.  Please do not buy this product	0
"I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it.
I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers"	1
This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace	0
"I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.  The only complaint I have is that the ""short"" section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby, thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib"	1
I was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by.  I tried it out with a baby doll first and I ended up covering the Snuggle Nest with my blankets in the middle of the night. 	0
This protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby.  Otherwise a good product.	1
"This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!  The ""kit"" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose.  Total and complete piece of junk!!"	0
This is one of the best products I have seen for the car seat.  I am very particular about my car and did not want the leather to get messed up.  This product is the best and will prevent items from spilling onto the sea	1
We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but, the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close, and hard to open, specially the one that goes between the legs, it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle  that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them, and is complicated to align them to finally buckle. In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips	0
This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs.  In contrast to one of the other reviews (and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer), this seat does the job adequately, and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs, measurements, fit, etc., IMHO.  There is no &quot;universal&quot; seat saver or, for that matter, car seat, that will fit every car.  This one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat, and hence, serves its purpose well	1
"At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems. 
But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby.
Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway."	0
I like this because it is a nice construction.  I bought the white and it blends in nicely.  I just wish it was a little higher.  We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now. 	1
"We started out really liking this seat.  Its colors are not horrid like most of the others, and it doesn't cry ""I have a baby!!"".  It just looks nice and stylish.  Also, our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat.  HOWEVER, the #1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts.  

First, you clip them together at the baby's midsection (easy).  Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom, so you can clip them (as one) into the female end of the lap belt clip.  This is easier said than done, as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them (as one) into the other part of the belt clip.  It's hard to explain properly, but really, it's not easy to do, especially if you have only one hand free.

Second, the belts get twisted.  The 2 pieces at the base of the belt, which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip, they get reversed because the belt twists.  Think of taking your seat belt in your car, and somehow twisting the belt itself, so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way.  If this has ever happened to you, you know what I mean, and it's a pain to fix.  Just like with this seat.  It seems to get screwed up effortlessly, but then to fix it takes several minutes.  

FORGET THIS THING!!  We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego, after we used a friend's when we went to visit them for a long weekend, and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did.  The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it...  Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room.  Yes, it cost us about $100 more, but it's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it's time for the standard (non-infant) car seat"	0
My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost. 	1
"I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy, they button onto the car seat and it isn't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off. The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on.

I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out.  But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don't want them to get a crook in their neck.  

I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat. "	0
If you're going to get the Baby Bjorn potty chair, you've got to get a matching stool!  I love how the stool has a rubbery-grip top to prevent slipping.  My son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair.  You've gotta get one now	1
I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though	0
I really like how this step was designed to stay in place.  We have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it.  This one stays put!  The only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top.  It is a little difficult to clean.  Since this is a potty step stool, it has gotten some messes on it that I wish would have been easier to get rid of	1
When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all	0
I bought this thinking it was a gimic. Worse case was my daughter would get a night light on her bed. Turns out this actually works. Her bedroom is filled with stars. She uses it every night and I use it to check on her. It is still using the original batteries, 30+ days. The amber color does not work so good but her walls are pink. On white it might work better. Get it for something diffrent that works	1
I bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all.  We have the Britax Roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow.  I returned it	0
This is a great light - shines stars all over the room.  Constellations aren't quite right, but they're close.  The different color options are great.  For the price, it's a great deal	1
I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!	0
I've had this seat for some time and I saw all of the negative reviews. It took a bit to figure out the quirks, but once I did, it was fine. The seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet, not the back or in the middle like mine at home. You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat. Otherwise it will fold, which is probably what happened to the other reviewer. It will slid off as you come off if you're not careful. My five year old uses it by herself and I use it with my 2 year old. It is so compact that I can stick it in my purse (I carry in in a zippy bag) and very easy to clean. There aren't too many of this type of product out there, but for me, it works just fine	1
I couldn't wait to get it.  I got so excited when it finally arrived!  so I used it right away! sooo disapointed! it did not get anything out at all, it is soooo weak! The one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from Target and it works! but this nasal-clear is no good. do not buy it	0
My sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect	1
"I was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere I looked, so I figured it must be awesome. Not so. It is loud, which freaked out my 8 month old, and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well. I've tried every aspirator on the market, and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital. I took that one home with me, and urge you to do the same :)

Very disappointed"	0
After using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub, this one is the best!  I only wish I would've just bought this one to begin with.  My little guy is 6 months old, 24 pounds but can't sit up yet.  He still uses the side that lays him down in the water, and he loves it!  Don't waste your money on other tubs, this one is the best.  This one will grow with your child while saving water too	1
This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.  We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless.  Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators. 	0
I ordered this pack after my friend's baby shower, she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was.  It fit both her and her husband very well, so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in.  WE love it.  It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great.  Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it, it has made our walks more enjoyable, I have free hands to hold our dogs' leashes and she likes being up to see everything.  I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack, but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars.  Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get, I cannot wait to go on a day hike.  I had been pricing other packs and they were close to $200, this was$90 w/ free shipping, a huge price break, plus I got it in about 3 days, thanks Amazon	1
"Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.

First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.

Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.

Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!

There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can"	0
"I bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and I am glad I did! I did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks I found were either MUCH more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features.  
My 7 month old daughter loves this backpack.  In addition, we don't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets. I did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use.  I originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but I can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well. I don't know how it would do for serious campers, but for every day use it has been GREAT. "	1
"I ordered this through Walmart.Com and received it damaged, but Walmart and/or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide.  The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib. So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box.  Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well.  Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large.  I then received the second crib and it was spotless.  The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer.  I was not impressed. 

I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib.  I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great.  I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.  "	0
"I bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and I am so glad I had it!  I used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller.  There are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it.  My daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep.  She loved being able to see everything around her at our level.  I am 5'3"" and my husband is 6'1"" and we both wore it comfortably.  I would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller"	1
"I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair  (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. 

Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap.

Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher.

ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS"	0
AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! My hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality, design, and function about products and he loves this carrier. I liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else. He tolerates being in this more than his stroller. This was my first choice based on all the feedback. Thanks	1
Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair	0
I bought these sheets online since I couldn't find any in the local Babies R' Us store and did so with hesitation.  But when I received them I couldn't be happier with them.  The best thing about these sheets, besides that they fit perfectly, is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug	1
"I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray.
2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!  

Good points:
-pop off tray
-divider that keeps them from slipping out
-cool colors

I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less"	0
"These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.

While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. 

I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.

I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.

Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. 

We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. 

We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one"	1
I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could	0
my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.  I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face!  Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night.  This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	1
I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies. I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different. My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal. I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great! Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair.	0
This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do.  I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is.  A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile.  The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands.  One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side. 	1
"We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week.
The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles"	0
My daughter recently had her second child, and spends alot of time breastfeeding. This product allows her to pump at her convenience. She can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child. The product works very well. She said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her, but it is an excellent product. She previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer, and heard how good the Medela brand was from a friend. This brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive, noisier pump she had before. We would highly recommend this product, and the product is well worth the price paid	1
First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead	0
It's expensive but worth it. It's nice to take to work because it looks professional (many people didn't even know what it was) and it comes with a cooler so I didn't have to put my milk in the fridge next to everyone's lunch. A friend also bought one around the same time and says she got it much cheaper on eBay for a brand new one.	1
I bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we're out running. Not only do the tabs not stick, as any toddler would, she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world. Wouldn't you?	0
"I LOVE this pump!

If you're going to breastfeed, you NEED this pump.  It's expensive, but worth the investment.  I pump at least 10 times a week and it's just so much easier than the manual pump I tried."	1
"We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...

I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying"	0
"I got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend. It worked great even after many years... I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag. It takes up less desk space (no extra space required for the bag). Also, it's more portable if all you need is the pump. I pump all over the house (study, bedroom, living room while watching TV with my husband).

Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast).

I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm."	1
The walker has a few flaws.  First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head.  My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly.  The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower. 	0
This is so much better than any potty chair, and it is never in the way! Very easy to put on and my daughter loves it! She ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also!!	1
This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility	0
This potty seat is the only toilet training item I have bought. I highly recomend it! My daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty. You need a step stool for them to get up on their own. I like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb. 3 ft. 2 yro. climbing up & situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal & this product I feel helps get to that goal.	1
I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon	0
This sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm & toasty on those cold san francisco nights.  it is really easy to use & to move from the carset to the stroller.  i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides, but it's the best thing around we've seen. 	1
We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker.  Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work.  I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy.  I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it.  And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes.  Other than that, I really like the walker!  lol :}  I think it will be better once we get a new toy	0
This fit very easily into my daughter's Graco infant car seat.  As the other reviewers said, it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm.  Wind has not seemed to be a problem, but then I only carry her between the car and my destination in it.  I would recommend this to a friend	1
I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops.  It does do those things but it is hard to clean.  It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of.  I used it twice and will never use it again.  I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done.  They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table.  I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did.  Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier.  You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag. 	0
"Our baby was born in early October and we put the Bundleme on her carrier immediately.  We live in Chicago and have had warm weather (75 degrees) and cold weather (10 below) since then.  We love this cover.  The top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall. It also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days. The day when it was 10 below freezing, she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit.  I was concerned for her warmth, but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be.  We have not had to buy a winter jacket.  It has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms. 
I have gotten numerous compliments on this cover (almost every time we take her out) and it still looks like new, even though many things have gotten spilled on it.  I would highly recommend this product"	1
"I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.  Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!
I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table"	0
"I love how wide they are.  This makes them much easier to clean and to handle.  Since they are shorter I can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when I use the stopper caps on them.  I can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short.  My baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles.  Her arms don't have to stretch as far.  

I haven't had any real problems with these bottles.  I was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem.  I went ahead with them because my sisters said they didn't have any problems with them.  They have leaked twice but only because I didn't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet.  Any bottle will leak if you don't screw the lid on sufficiently.  I have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when I watched my twin cousins.  We tried three different brands and weren't ever really happy with any of them"	1
"[...] to see how worthless the Graco Lovin' Hug swing is.  The baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds (the swing has a supposed 30-pound limit).  The swing is on hard floors, is brand new, as are the batteries, and still the swing barely moves at all, even on the highest level!  When I contacted the company, they told me that the swing won't go as high when a baby gets larger, but this brief movie proves that it won't ""go"" at all!!  Instead, I highly recommend the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Swing.  I only wish it held a larger baby so I could continue to use it!

"I wouldn't call this a ""rocker seat"" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair.

The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a ""rocker"", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!"	1

I wish I would have bought this bouncer when I first found it.  My son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer. This one holds up to 40 pounds.  I didn't buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me.  So I tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute. Then I realized that if those people could get $35+; then I could too when I was done with it. So I finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds.  He loves it. I love it.  It's made very well. If I had bought it when I first found it I would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it. So don't hesitate. You won't be sorry. 	1
The &quot;sticky&quot; pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.  The organizer doesn't come with any information, so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not.  This is a great idea, but it is very poorly constructed. 	0
"I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.

Pros:
-very comfy seat, good padding 
-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely
- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat
- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing
- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.
- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.
- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position
- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo
- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo


Cons:
I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).
- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.
- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.
- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems
-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!

Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it"	1
The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it!	0
"I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.  We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).

Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:

1) The base is super easy to install.  Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base.  That's it.  Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.
    
2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping).  Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.
    
3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows.  No such system on our old seat.
    
4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.
    
5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.
    
6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room.  Every inch helps.
    
7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure  and solid as the old one.
    
All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one.  Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly.  The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.

Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price!  Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :"	1
I got two of these as shower gifts.  I thought that they would be so handy.  WRONG!  The velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table.  The openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are VERY small.  They will only hold the travel size or the next size up.  It was made cheep. The &quot;shelves&quot; are not sturdy at all.  Save your money!	0
I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this	1
We loved the monitor at first.  The features are nice and the price was reasonable.  Then, without event or explanation, it died one day and we haven't been able to recharge one of the handheld units.  Maybe we got a dud	0
I read some other reviews that were poor, but I disagree.  My son loves this toy.  He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room.  It plays music continually for 12 minutes. So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out.  We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy.  However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons.	1
"We purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units.  Don't bother.  Whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor's baby!  What's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you can't then walk into the baby's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren????  

They are getting returned right away. "	0
"I tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us.  We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent's Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design.

These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she's feeding.  This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth.  She also has reflux.  I can't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds.  However, I have to think they've helped a bit.  They are also comfy to hold for me.

I've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking.  I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it.  So, I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since.

They are a bit pricy, but I believe that you get what you pay for.  

Lastly, I don't think that the small parts are difficult to wash.  Yes, it's a bit more time consuming if you don't have a dish washer, but for us, it's been well worth the extra time"	1
You really do get what you pay for.  I got this for around $53 but I did NOT like this product at all! The bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made. The comforter is pretty cheap too. The only thing I saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup	0
We started with Dr. Brown's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning.  We've used them both for breastmilk and for formula, and they've been great for both.  We've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes, and I give all the credit to the bottles.  They're comfortable for me to hold, light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own, and easy to fill.  The cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it's worth it.  And we haven't found that Dr. Brown's leaks any more than any other brand.  Definitely give these a try - they're great	1
Tired of hearing your baby cry?  This is the monitor for you.  You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing.  Looks like Evenflo  was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect.  You can barely hear anything at full volume.  I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.       	0
This is a thin sheet but it fits my full-size Pack N Play bassinet perfectly.  I would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often	1
The monitor was terrible!  It would only pick up our baby's voice when she was screaming.  It had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference.  It is going back to the store and I am looking for something else.  I wish I would have checked ratings first!  Choose something else	0
I purchased this despite the reviews I read, out of desperation!  But have been very happy with the fit on my Eddie Bauer Morgan Gingham playard bassinet.  It is a little thin, however, I use a Carter's mattress pad underneath anyway, so I am not concerned with absorbancy.  It does the job as a nice surface to lay my son's head on, and I purchased one more in Navy to switch out when it is laundry time	1
We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	0
I purchased these for my Pack N' Play, and they are soft and durable.  A real must-have for pack-n-play owners	1
"My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green ""on"" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes."	0
I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased!  Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age.  We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry.  Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won't fall off the wall.  Sizewize, it's basically a perfect fit in our tub, which is slightly tapered from head to toe, but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub. 	1
This monitor didn't work for us at all! We heard a lot of static, and the alarm would go off too. It wouldn't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen.  The alarm was always going off.	0
When I saw the pictures, I thought I could fit both kids. They fit, but with little room for two. No room for play.  I will purchase another one. Still a good product, safe and sturdy and easy to clean.	1
I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	0
"I've been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and I think I've found it!  We've been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born, but he has clearly outgrown it.  I tried one of those seat tubs(?), but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs ... TERRIBLE tub.  Thankfully I was able to return that one.  I found this one here on Amazon and reluctantly purchased it.  Glad I did!!  It allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play (now that he can sit up unsupported).  Bath time has become much more fun ... for both mom & baby!

UPDATE : i first reviewed this after we purchased the item.  I've been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn.  I don't think i've used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than ""expected"".  Unfortunately, the patch-kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely.  Very unfortunate because we loved the tub.

New rating : 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore"	1
I was so excited to buy this stroller. It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us! 	0
It's kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad, it gets the job done, it folds rather compactly, I think it's well worth the money	1
I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups.	0
Love it!  Fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it	1
I've heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself.  I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link.  Not just a littler either but with every use.  My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases.  I find this odd b/c the 6mths cups don't link at all. I think these products are very hit or miss. You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great. ?	0
I expected a sage or mint to come in the package when I ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking.  I don't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right.  Kiwi is bette	1
"This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic ""leak stopper"", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak. "	0
I was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews, but I did it anyway, and I'm glad.  The covers are durable--the color hasn't faded, and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad.  I think they're soft enough for diaper changing--I wouldn't put my baby to sleep on it, but then, who would	1
I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good.  Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak.  My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star.   Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.  	0
I bought this beacause I needed my gate to be just a little bit wider.  It attached very easily and was easy to install.  Also, it is very hard to find in stores	1
"I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles, that we would love their ""magic"" cups. I am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups.  It seems like the lid and cup don't seal together well enough to withstand any activity. I'm sad to have to give Avent a bad rating, but don't waste your money on these cups"	0
This has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk, formula and now baby food jars. It heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it. I wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child. I think that this is a very good investment, especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it doesn't heat ANYTHING evenly!!	1
Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid	0
Heats milk and food esecially when frozen. I use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food I've made	1
The screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately --- was about to use my own, then read the review below and decided I'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . . 	0
"After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product.  I love it!  I'm not sure if they made a different model before, but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine (its on the back).  Its not rocket science if you follow the directions.  I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.  It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature.  There are no ""dings"" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me.  Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.  As a first time mom, I highly recommend it. "	1
I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option.  We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation.  Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell.  I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped	0
I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner	1
We got this as a gift and  have used it 0 times.  It's expensive and poorly designed.  A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper, easier to fold, and nicer looking	0
"I have used many infant tubs and I love this one!  It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry.  It fits in the sink, and I keep the faucet running like a little shower, and I can rinse her with fresh water.  I actually think the angle is great for an infant, but with a newborn I use one of those ""yellow bear sponges"" in the tub for extra support (but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used). "	1
This did not work for us at all.  I found that I couldn't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off.  If you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton	0
you don't need the whole kit. only the loop and latch is needed. if you use the plastic, it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway.  you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing.  this way, you can use the softfit breastshield too	1
"I agree with the first reviewer,""Cindy""--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.).  The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.  However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better"	0
This product works great.  You hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things.  I am so glad a coworker told me about this product	1
"I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22"" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit."	0
Well, I felt a little silly paying about $20 (with shipping) for 2 pieces of plastic, 2 bra hooks, and some rubber bands.  However, the kit does work, and does allow you to pump hands free.  One word of caution - if you use Medela's Quick Clean steam bags to clean your pump parts, TAKE THE HANDS FREE PLASTIC SLEEVES OFF before throwing the bag in the microwave!  Otherwise, they warp and don't fit right	1

This baby gate is great!!! the top of my stairs both walls going in 2 different angles and i am so glad that i found this gate! it works great and i havn't had any problams with it at all. I installed it as soon as i got it. and i didnt seem to have any problams installing it. I have a 2 yr old and all moms and dads out there know how 2 yr olds can be at trying out new things! it is a tall gate so he cant lean over it and fall. all the bars on it are vertical so he cant climb it. and the lock on it is easy to use but he cant unlock it. The gate is made out of metal and is welded together so you dont have to worry about the bars coming out like you do with the wooden gates. I highly recomend this gate for any room any doorway and its great at the top of the stairs	1
I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door.  I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex.  I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it.  I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.  I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels.  Note to self:  keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!	0

So far I haven't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies (also we haven't run into issues to need it) but I have used the nose aspirator and it's great.  It's soft and I don't fear hurting his nose!  I'm very excited to use the rest of the products	1
Very useless pants.  I bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and I did buy the correct size.  They even leaked when used over diapers at night.  They bascially do nothing	0
"I bought the same brand, but maybe an newer/older version of this? It didn't have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned.  However, it DID have an Infant Tylenol equivelent, which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet.

The gas drops are fantastic - thank goodness we had these, especially when we had to change his formula!!  Anytime our son was ""fussy for no reason"" we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time.  The saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds. The aspirator works fine, I've never tried a different one, so can't compare.  He didn't care about the teething toy, and doesn't care for the taste of the teething gel, but it seems to work.  It also has two cooling wipes which we haven't had to use (no fevers yet!).

Overall I was really glad to have this, and to have all these things together in a nice case I slid right under his changing table - no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night.  I'd recommend this to all new moms"	1

I definitely like the Drop-Ins liners better than the traditional ones...  from a convenience standpoint, paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system.

I'm not planning on any more children, but I don't dare part with these bottles yet.  They are stored in my basement for future use, either my myself or family members.  They also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze"	1
"(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???
My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!"	0
"This is absolutely the best bottle on the market. After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.  

The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up.

I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!!

Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.) "	1
I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long	0
"I'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl. I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say ""both"", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too. And my daughter is now starting to ""help"" hold on to the bottle while I feed her. These are the best"	1
This carrier didn't survive one airline trip.  The bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip.  This carrier is junk.  Waste of my money	0
I wish that it would zip up all the way... The top is coming down all the time and I have to adjusted. Maybe it's better for a two and up age child.	1
I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made, then I got a new bag (customer service was very nice and helpful) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it (my stroller wasn't damaged), so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money, still waiting on a refund	0
This product was recently purchased for my 5 1/2 month old son's stroller by my mother-in-law & I love it. I had an older hand-me-down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better. I love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another.I only wish it came in more colors & color combinations	1
I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper.  It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap.  I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover.  This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye.  Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60.   	0
"I have been using the Graco Snugride since my son was about 2 months old - he's now five months old.  The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry.  As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat.

The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness.  The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily.  I have found that I have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly, which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car.  Apart from that, the seat provides good value for the price"	1
I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only	0
"We got this seat in a different color for our first baby.  We feel very secure with it. Easy to install and a little hint, they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars... you don't need it, you can fasten the seat without the base. the directions for it are on the seat. 
   I like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it, and that it's transportable to our stroller. (bough seperatly) It comes with a head ""brace"" whatever those things are called to cradle the head. Those never do anything, and are pretty useless, but the seat itself is great."	1
Don't buy this humidifier!  It is MUCH too loud	0
"My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!! 

Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now.

With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already.

Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!)"	1
I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower. But after several tries, I finally returned it. This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically. Well, the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on, my baby wakes up crying!!! Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base, and the planes don't even wake her!!!! Don't buy this product	0
I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son. My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children. Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well. He loves the arm rests and the cup holder. It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary. We liked it so much we are going to buy  another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	1
Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly. I feel like I'm constantly filling the container w/ water. Though my son is a sound sleeper, it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr. I would not buy this item	0
My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son.  He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old.  The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it.  Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time. 	1
I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it	0
That's just it- I love this product, and I am so happy that we purchased it.  It saves time and space, and is very safe for my children.  We bought 2, one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful	1
I have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing.  Child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her.  I will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck	0
I was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry. I am so glad I did. I have only had to empty it about every 6-7days and it is simple and odor free. Even when full there is no odor! I didnt need to put in a refill for 3months. the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts. in comparison, its cheaper! I would recommend this to anyone	1
I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth	0
"The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market!  It's easy to operate and stays odor-free!  To get rid of a dirty diaper, just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail.  Completely hands-free!  You don't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie.  When the pail is full, just pull out the bag, cut it loose on the door-mounted blade, and tie a knot in the top.  Then, just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers!  The ""continuous liner"" concept is genius!  I've been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter's birth ... and I'm still on the same refill that came with the pail.  I did, however, stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry! :-"	1
I spent a lot of time researching strollers, and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one.  Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight, but I have not been pleased with it since.  The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat.  The snack cup has never stayed in place.  Steering this stroller is impossible...we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida.  All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego	0
I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn, and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews.  And we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl.  I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car, but it was a BREEZE.  I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes.  My car has the LATCH system, and it has worked great.  My daughter loves being in her car seat, and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it.  I was surprised to read the other reviews, since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat.  I would highly recommend this seat to any parent	1
I just bought the knobs and they are terrible!!!!  I have so much trouble opening them.   DO NOT BUY IT!!!!  IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY,  it's better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it.  	0
"I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old, and he's now 8 1/2 months old.  We've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix (7+ hours each way).  It doesn't work miracles, but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss, about 70%-80% of the time.  And I think it's more effective now than it was when we first got it, maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it. It might help that I *only* use it when he starts to fuss. 

I haven't had any problems with the toy working, and the volume dial is a nice feature. It does have its shortcomings, though, like some of the other reviewers pointed out: It only stays on for about 15 minutes (presumably to save batteries) so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat, I push the button to turn it on, just in case we need it during the drive.  It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror, but it still works to distract him.  It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order, but they are all extremely short, so it ends up being very repetitive.  

Overall, I think it's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips, and when it doesn't work it's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car.  And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying, it's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together"	1
With our knobs being on the front of the stove, these covers hung down over the oven door, and either got in the way, or were popped off on a regular basis (or pulled off by our 16 month old). We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn't in use	0
I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!	1
"I agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had I come to Amazon first, I would not have wasted my money.  I got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and, being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight, he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove.  So we got and installed these covers.  Within minutes he discovered them -- and became even MORE fascinated with the stove!  He immediately began spinning them around on the knobs, and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward, the cover and the knob come right off together!  Now he had a fascinating new ""rattle"" to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain.  Our solution?  We took the real knobs off the stove, period.  We keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook.  As for these clear covers, they're are still in the closet -- maybe I can use them to display insect specimens or something?  Useful as knob locks they are NOT"	0
"Due to the room layout, I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed.  We don't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these ""in person"" and then decide which one best fit our needs.  So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails.

After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out, we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years.

To help others, I have attached two customer's photos to this product description.  These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail.  Why amazon/Target can't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me.  But that seems to happen many times.  

This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed.  This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took.  

The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows:
(1)	It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed.
(2)	This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible.  
(3)	The quality of the construction (especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins) was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead (which is also made by Regalo.)
(4)	The design made more sense than the Regalo.   The installation was more straightforward.  

Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows:
(1)	It is only 17"" high, so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit.  In our case, our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11"" high, depending on where you measure it.  So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress.   But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue.
(2)	This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down.   Others had more substantial locking mechanisms.   I could see where a toddler who watched you do this, could then do it himself.  So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler, only during sheet changes.   Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be.  

Despite these two issues, we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us.  However, if we are later disappointed with this bed rail, I will go and update our review.   "	1
"My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas.

Bad design.  Don't waste your money"	0
This is a good quality item for the money.  I LOVE that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets.  I just bought a second one for grandma's house! 	1
I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface. THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around. Also a few of my knobs pull off easily. My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come, both knob and cover. Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover. They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. It probably depends on your stove	0
"I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable.  The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them.

The shades come with two straps, one small and one large.  My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big.  The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head.  In this position, her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it's not a big deal.  If straight around her head, the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes.  Even if adjusted as small as possible, the large strap is still a little too big.  It should fit in another month I think. "	1
This pump is REALLY slow, and absolutely KILLS your hand. For about the same price get the Avent Isis manual pump, it is WAAAAAAY faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump, so it doesn't hurt your hand. I haven't found that it hurts my hand at all, because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often.	0
I own this blanket and just bought another! I brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park. It was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me, my daughter, and all of our stuff. A few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too. My baby spits up quite a bit, especially during tummy time, so I decided to buy another one to use in the house. It cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth. Great investment	1
the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected. 	0
I purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby.  My plan was to carry it along with me whenever I would visit family and friends at their homes.  I could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface.  The blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches, which will accommodate adults well.  I was pleased when I received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece.  The quality is absolutely top notch!  The surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur.  The only slight con I have of the Essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side.  This is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time.  Otherwise I adore this blanket and highly recommend it	1
There is no need for this item.  It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed.  I hated having a wall between my baby and me.  When I woke up to nurse, I had to take her out of it anyway.  Co-sleeping is intuitive, naturally safe and easy easy easy... please don't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement.	0
"This is our third baby monitor.  The first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices.  This one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static.  The talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old (""Go back to sleep,"" ""I'll get you juice in the morning,"" etc.)  Not having to get up and go to the child's room is a real feature.

The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren't encrypted.  Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations, but most monitors are this way.   We took the monitor to a friend's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house (Video monitor, TV, I don't know.)  Since it only had two channels, we were not able to find a clear channel. 

Overall thoughts: Best monitor I've had (Stay away from the Fisherprice models).  I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex (I wouldn't want other people listening in), and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels"	1
"I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use.  Getting it back into it's ""bag"" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.  

I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it!  I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money!  I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20!  It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND!  (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!)

DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product! "	0
"I was debating between this analog model and digital models. I have never heard the digital models to be honest. But this analog model has been great. I can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to ""buy time"" when I am busy and can't get to her immediately. I have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about. If your family is on a tight budget like mine, this is in the best bang for the buck out there today"	1
"One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw:  it cant be put back into its carrying form.  Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.  

This ""floppy"" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car.

After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)  

Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag."	0
I have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature.  It works well and has a great range.  The vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep	1
"I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor, my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area; this way, I can pad him in and he's secure.  However, I find it very difficult to manage.  

I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other!  The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand!

Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out.

All of that being said, once baby is properly ""installed"", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles"	0
My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended	1
The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller. 	0
I love this product. I have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early. I swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the NICU and they loved sleeping that way. I stopped swaddling them at 2 months because I could see they no longer liked it. My night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year. She said it would help them sleep through the night. I bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them. Not long after I started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7. What a dream! He is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all. I have found that it works better when I put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep. We don't use them during the day now. I will always give this as a baby gift going forward	1
This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day. Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz. in 15 to 20 min. My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter. Geat pump at a great price	0
"As very frequent (often long-distance) travelers, we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips.  We really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller (the Graco travel system) for ease of use, but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat, we tried practically every method for moving the seat, toddler, diaper bag, collapsible stroller, carry-on, etc., from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated.    Of all of the options that we tried, the Pac Back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient.  I'm not very tall (5'5""), and find that I can manage to wear the Pac Back, stow loose and light objects (such as coats or stuffed animals) in the car seat itself, sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other, and still have enough mobility/agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand.  (Granted, I look like a Pac Animal, but that's a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments.)  The  strap system is intuitive to use and seems well-constructed.  Compared to a car seat bag, the Pac Back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane, and I have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two -- plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane.  The straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and I can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves.  The only drawbacks: you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you don't bash someone or something while turning, and the straps may have to be removed to go through security IF the x-ray machine has an extremely small opening (only happened once or twice at regional airports).  Overall, an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product."	1
I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.	0
We have had this puzzle toy since my son was one. (He's 3 now.) It has provided hours of entertainment and education.  We started by just showing him a few choices and matching, now he can easily do the whole box himself, and enjoys it.  I like the textures, vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces.  The nice sturdy box to hold them is great too. 	1
Don't buy peg-perego their customer service is horrible!! I will NEVER buy from them again!!	0
"When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep"	1
"I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly ""wobbly"".  I was shocked as I figured such an ""upscale"" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little ""envelope"" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name"	0
The mom who received this gift was very pleased with it	1
"I absolutely agree with this review: ""You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006""

We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.

My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.

The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.

The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.

Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.

I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.

If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son"	0
"I love this Item.  It was a life saver.  At around 4-6 weeks, my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding.  Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a ""No, No"" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS.  I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it.  I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another ""no, no"" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro.  And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night.  He's 4 months old now and we're still using them.... Buy a few, because if we wets himself, which boys do a lot, you'll need another one to switch him into"	1
"After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice.  I was VERY wrong.  When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large ""bag"" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in.
Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the ""Usage"" part.. but on the back under ""Cautions"" it states this:  ""Unplug power cord when not in use"".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy! 
Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.  
For the record.. I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell.  This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info.!!!!!!  Also.. this is baby #4 so I am quite familiar with baby products. "	0
"We love the swaddle me blankets.  We have the flannel and the fleece.  This has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night (in just two weeks of using them).   She loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again.  With the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer.

The fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat.  Have not tried the cotton ones.

Definitely worth a try"	1
It worked great for a few days, then as I got to the bottom of the batch of wipes, they were totally dry.  Also, the whole thing flooded my changing table, not sure why, but I am returning this unit	0
HI this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs. Some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child. Some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over. This one is great I love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble!	1
My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings	0
I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub	1
"I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers.  Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.  
But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings. 
Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM! 
My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months. 
All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without. "	0
We looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we've found.  I love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down, it stores flat, and that you can add as many toys as you want.  Our baby has really enjoyed it.  There is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time	1
"The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these. 

Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause"	0
My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment	1
"I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.
So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown.""  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!"	0
"I love this carrier (I bought it in Feb 2007). My daughter loves it too. She can sleep very well in it. The only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb, while mine is already 17lb (she is only 3 months). I guess I don't have too much time to use it. If this company could develop a one which suits for big baby, I will definitely buy it.
ji"	1
"I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's ""Best Pick"" Yeah right! I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis. Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking! I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money"	0
I definately recommend this product. I used it every day for my baby for the first 9 months. Great both indoors and outdoors!	1
"The idea for this product is great.  The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles.

The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex.  This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place.  They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.

If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect"	0
"I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive, since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower.  But knowing what I know now, Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it.

My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times, the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep.  (She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much)  Being that it was so used, Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off.  The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use. 

Now that my baby is getting older, I switch her forward and she loves that.  She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her.  The ease of the clips is a godsend, so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me.

I tried some other carriers, but all the straps and clips were so confusing.  Plus alot of the others arent reversible.  You can only have your baby face inwards.  

This is totally worth the money guys!   "	1
I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed.  She says the sheets are itchy.  The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard.  I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"This is my second superyard. The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers. Aside from being a little stiff to fold (which might be because it is new) this model is a vast improvment over the old. It's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier. Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby. 
During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I've 
ever owned. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with North States' customer service has been poor"	1
Do not buy this or any item from Baby Age.  Their customer service is horrible.  Amazon should remove all of their listings	0
The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion.  Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it.  You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained.	1
I placed this order on July 25th, Amazon's estimated delivery date is Aug 18th-25th. I contacted BabyAge, and my order wont be sent until the 6th of Sept. Very disappointed	0
This play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers, espicially ones that garden, since the invention of disposable diapers! I bought two and an extension panel, which make for an ample size playpen. Inside, I put a Little Tikes climber, a Step One ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel, and a Playskool Grow-With-Me picnic table, and he still has plenty of room to romp. I can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips.	1
"This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the ""catch"", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through. "	0
These work really well, but be sure to get a couple of the magnets, because we lost our first one and then we were all hosed for a while	1
"I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on ""Play"" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product"	0
I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests.  The gate is built well...simple and functional.  It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily.  It went up easy and works as designed.  It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue.  In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close.  My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended.  Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs	1
Our 4 month old loved this toy, at first.  But we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it didn't work more than it did.  Runs through batteries much too quickly. Also, unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin. But now it is in the trash because I touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust.  Not very safe.  Very disappointed	0
"The gate works perfectly.  However, it doesn't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive.  I am very handy with tools, remodeling, etc. and I found the installation to take longer than I would have expected.  The latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top.  There was a ""U"" stamped in it, but no mention of that in the instructions.  Nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom.  How hard would that be?  One sentence?  I went through a dry run and figured it all out, but it doubled the installation time (took +/- 1 hour)"	1
I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon.  The size is small and convenient, but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck.  Also, the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks!  I am really disappointed, and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag.  	0
"I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room.  I have read countless reviews of the ""double faced tape foam pads"" that come off right away with little effort.
This product attached exactly as described.  I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes.  The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace.  I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried.  Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced.  An absolute must for your hearth."	1
The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction	0
"I love this stroller, and tell all of my friends about it. Our daughter was about 3 months old when I purchased it. 
There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched, and there still is not. You can run, walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe. Lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks, and occasional rollerblading.
She is a fussy girl, (only) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat, but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB. 
We live in Florida, and with the sun-guard canopy, she is well covered.
Some other factors which made we chose BOB:
* The braking mechanism, which is hard to find, has a wrist strap which if you should fall, locks the back wheels (unlike most strollers on the market). This feature is great for rollerbladers.
* 5 point safety harness
* 70 pound weight limit (highest that I found)
* Metal frame (others have more plastic that metal)
* Shock absorbers, great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep
* Swivel front wheel, which locks with a simple pin.
* Simple Lily likes it, and we tried several others, all that Babies-R-Us has in stock.

The cost is pretty high, but would you put a price on the safety of your child, if you were to fall while exercising?

Thanks for hearing me out"	1
"I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the ""shelves"" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out. "	0
"We bought this swing for our 11 month old daughter, and she loves it!  We attached it to our back porch easily enough, and she swings in it every day!  We've had it for about a month and it is still her favorite toy!  
The only issue that we have had is that it hangs slightly crooked because of the way that they put the hooks on the swing at the factory.  The aren't both facing the same direction, which is something that we cant fix, but it isn't bad enough to not use the swing or to cause any problems.  Its more irritating than anything.  Also, the swing seems secure and safe.  We've not had any issues with safety, or even any close calls"	1
I saw this at the store, and I just had to buy it.  I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place.  The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table.  What a marvelous concept!  So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it.  It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical!  When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump.  So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead.  It was the next best thing and I really did like the device.  I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it.  So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it.  This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed.    	0

"I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic ""Diaper Depot"" by Prince Lionheart"	0
This is a great sterilizer, it's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings.  I bought it when my son was born and after a year, I'm still using it.  It works great, saves time, and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete.	1
Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use.	0
My daughter is just learning how to self-feed and these placemats are great.  I've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are.  This product solves that problem.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off.  However, I do NOT find this to be a major problem.  Also, I tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table.  Great tip.  Thanks.  This is a great product for kids learning to eat	1
I bought the volo after reading many reviews. However, it was utter disappointment. As soon as I took out the stroller from a box, and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece. Yes, the stroller is light, and very very flimsy. I returned it right away	0
Now that I've caved to the power of pink (it only took three girls for me to finally give in), this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest I could find.  Quality seems fine (two weeks post purchase) and who doesn't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood...?  For the first babe, we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat, but had so many functions it was basically useless.  This is a case, though, where the basics are the best.  In looking around for a new one, saw many for $100; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic, this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months, anyway	1
"We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel. I think it's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo, not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down.
On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact. Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange. The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car.
We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad. This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller. The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller. I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support. On top of it, the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same. The awning offers very little sun protection. The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access. On top of that, you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller.
When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired. With limited cargo room, it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles. It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering. Further, while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car, riding escalators and getting on and off the bus, the Volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces. We encountered potholes, dirt paths, cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster. The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters. Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief. Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo.
If I had to do it over, I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels, easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat"	0
We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them!  Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down....she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive....and she doesn't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating.  We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages....and they don't work worth anything!  The adhesive on those is down the sides, not across the top where it should be, to stick on the shopping cart handle....In fact we've decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart.  Also, with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently, we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table!  Well done	1
"This is the most stupid product you can buy. It makes opening doors even easier. Maybe instead of selling this as a ""door knob lock"", it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis. This doesn't even deserve one star"	0
"We have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she's almost 2 now.  We keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of ""pocket bibsters.""  Whenever we eat out at a restaurant, we stick this down at our toddler's place.  She sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate, it spills onto this nice clean mat.  The mat also has entertainment value, as she can name the items on it.  After she's made her mess, we just peel the mat off, wad it up, and throw it away"	1
We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents.  This cover lasted about one minute.  Seriously!  By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors, my son had opened the first one my husband had installed.  The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open.	0
I loved this product.  My baby slept in it until she was able to turn over.  She resisted swaddling, and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib.  I agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful, particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down. 	1
I installed this mirror in our car two days ago.  Today it was in my daughter's lap when I went to get her out of the car.  The mirror broke off from the base.  I bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors (suction cup attachment, etc).  I would not recommend this product	0
This is a great wipes warmer for use with cloth wipes if you are cloth diapering.  The wipes are nice and warm and don't dry out.  I have seen no rust like one of the other reviews said.  Nightlight is also very nice and gives just enough light to see in the middle of the night.  I change out the wipes every 3-4 days and have had no problems with mildew. 	1
Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there.  This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless.  It is just very poorly made from cheap materials.  I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target.  Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design.  Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money	0
This mobile is amazing. From the time she was 6 weeks old, my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music. She loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile. Although it can be noisy, it doesn't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds. A MUST for any nursery	1
we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good.  the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again.  sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking. 	0
Its a little hard to adjust, but its definitely worth it.  We've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller.  Folds away easily and doesn't take up a lot of space.  I also love the pockets on the sides where I can store my keys, phone, water bottle, etc	1
We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift.  For a few months it worked very well...easy to use.  After about 8 months it started acting strange, giving us inaccurate readings.  The final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son's temperature wasn't even over 100.  The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital. 	0
Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park -fantastic!  Easy to put on - easy to store!  I don't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway!   But this did it's duty	1
When I purchased these drapes, I assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the Zanzibar valences, sheets, etc. Wrong! The material is striped, and is a darker, different shade of brown than the rest of the set. I love the other items in this set, but don't waste your money on these drapes--they look awful	0
I bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape.  We use it to hold all my little girl's stuffed animals and she has alot of them!  On occasions we do include her heavy toys -- no problem at all.  We live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that doesn't take up too much space, but big enough to store away toys	1
I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board	0
This is a very cute table perfect for my 2 kids.  They like having picnics outside sitting at their table that is just the right size for them.  As far as assembly my husband put it together rather quickly and it is very sturdy.  I am pleased with my purchase	1
I really was disappointed with this product. Our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile.	0
We just bought this for our 3 yr. old, and he does everything on it! It is very durable, and also light weight so we can move it around easily. This table will last well through our second son as well.	1
Did not stick to tile. Sucktions were big but it just sit in the corner	0
Well made and well priced. Your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it... more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart. Buy buy bu	1
Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls	0
Play Table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson (18 months) loves it.  It is good for small children - better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over. I wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely	1
So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn't stick to the wall. At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower, but oh no that's not it at all. Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon. But yet again, the darn thing came un-stuck. So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn't register for, investigate whether or not it's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return. Literally. 	0
The bundleme is a must for any mom. It works so well! It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets. The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her. As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm. She was actually sweating. Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy. We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect. No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car. The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it's the only part that needs washed you don't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece. You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you'll be indoors for a short period of time. I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again	1
I can't get it to stick! I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold, but as soon as I put toys in it, it falls	0
Don't bother with bulky snowsuits.  This makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby.  We live in the north east, so it is a life saver.  Yummy snuggly	1
"The whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub, but that is impossible since it won't stick to tile above the tub.  I hadn't even put any toys in it, and it wouldn't stick.  I returned it and found something on ""One Step Ahead"". "	0
I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat.  It was awesome.  I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough.  They did tell me at the hospital, however, that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat.  This goes underneath them so it probably does, but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway	1

I got this hat because it matched the JJ Cole Bundle Me blanket for my son's car seat. He looks absolutely adorable in it, but he hates wearing it unfortunately. The elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down. Overall, if your baby is a hat-wearer and this fits him/her, then it's wonderful. It's warm, soft and is made very well	1
The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter.  My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her. 	0
FINALLY!!!  I am a stickler for matching things, with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but I LOVE having the matching hat for my December baby, I know she's warm.	1
The suctions are pretty weak, dont stick well to the tray.  Also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up. The arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face.  When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick, as soon as my son would touch it, it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face.  They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time. I took this back the next day. I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead.  It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose, even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray.	0
It is still waiting for the baby to arrive, so I haven't used it yet....  but I do love the utility and design of it	1
This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing	0
My son loves this mobile, it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around. 	1
For some reason the product was not delivered, UPS returned it.  This was send for charity.  After many emails and phone calls, the company refuses to respond or refund the money. SHipping was more than the product	0
"I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market.  When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play.  The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned.  The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old.  She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings.  She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption!

And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays.  There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys.  The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle.  I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play.  I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up.

Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product!  I'd put it on the new parent's ""must have"" list for sure"	1
I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.	0
I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter. There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago. This one was exactly what I wanted. She has room to roll around and play with toys and it's easy to set up and take down	1
This item is packaged horribly. If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price. Received changing hutch and tower, crib and toybox intact. Very happy. Ordered this dresser twice, both times damaged. Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks. My suggestion is to order two dressers, take the best pieces from each, and return the rest. Believe me, you will be glad you did	0
"We bought this stroller for my daughters: 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds.  We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again.  I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like ""a baby,"" but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc.  This stroller was the answer!
The front seat is perfect for our little one.  The tray swings open (and comes completely off, if needed) to get her in and out easily.  I was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because I didn't think a 5-point harness was necessary.  The tray is large and sturdy, as is the foot rest.
My older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines, but we have absolutely no problem because of it.  She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break.
The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller.  We can store keys, snacks, cellphone, etc., plus two cups/bottles.  The basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access.  The side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be.
The stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily.  It takes very little room to store.  The steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push.
The stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant.
The price is fantastic too.  You can't beat $120 for a double stroller like this!
I wish we had bought this a year ago"	1
"I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly.  The two main parts, left side board and right side board, both came in totally cracked.  When I called in to order replacements, the customer service rep knew exactly what I'm calling to re-order.  ?!?!?!  If it's a known problem, why not fix it?!  

The customer service reps are very nice, but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn't make this product very attractive.  The processing itself takes 2-3 weeks.  In my case, 3 weeks later, I found out that my 2 parts are on back-order, awaiting shipment by container from Brazil.  So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it.  I hope the dresser arrives before the baby... "	0
This product is great. It is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it.  But I found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier.  Makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old	1
I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble	0
I have no idea how our parents had us with out these!  They are the best invention!  My son likes to play with plates, so I can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating.  I have a toddler and a 9 mo old.  NEITHER of them have been able to remove these things.  And beleive me, they've tried.  So I dont know what that other review was talking about.  They're inexpensive, easy to use, and clean. 	1
Do not order this item! I ordered and returned this item FOUR times due to cracked pieces. Storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage. I refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture. What a disaster and diappointment	0
I BOUGHT THIS MONITOR SO I CAN HEAR WHAT GOES ON IN MY SONS ROOM WHO IS UPSTAIRS.  I HAVE CRYSTAL CLEAR RECEPTION AND I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MONITOR IN THE HOUSE FOR ANOTHER ROOM AND THEY NEVER GET INTERRUPTED.  IT IS EXTREMLY SENSITIVE, EVERY BREATH IS HEARD.  AWESOME MONITOR, NO PROBLEMS YET SO FAR !!!	1
This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY!	0
"I recently purchased this monitor when my old Fisher Price 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year.  I could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs.  I figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim.  

Well... It works and I enjoy this monitor so much better that I am considering replacing my other Fisher Price one.  With this monitor I do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise.  My other one makes a low static sound all the time, it is not bother some but I can still hear it.  I would highly recommend this model. The price is great and I have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that I can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries.  

A great find, a great buy, a great product"	1

I love this key and cell phone set so much I'm buying another one for a friend.  I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall.

i own these bottles they seemed nice.but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean.i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle.im thowing mine out	0
We bought this for our son (now two), and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car.  It gives him something to play with, and they aren't too noisy for long trips	1
I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable	0
"My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl (Apr. 9, 2007) and I simply could NOT live without this item. My daughter loves sleeping in it. 

It is light; therefore, it can be easily moved from one room to another, as needed. You could easily travel with it.... from hotels to the ""Grandparents house."" It can be folded compactly and easily stored; and, there is also a handle for carrying. The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well.  ***Obviously, do not leave your child unsupervised in it!**  

It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents"	1
I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles. 	0
"This is the single best new baby item that I purchased!!  I was a mom who swore that ""my baby will never sleep in my bed"".  Needless to say that didn't last 3 nights.  I got this co sleeper and it was just perfect.  Felt much more secure with him in there.  Very portable too, I took it everywhere for the first three months"	1
As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition.  I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies.  I bought a starter kit and several other bottles.  I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak.  I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid.  Nothing helped.  My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them.  I switched to another brand and now we are very dry	0
like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary).  we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep.  Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up.  We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks.  overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months	1
Doesn't stay in place, too expensive...  I do better with a waterproof diaper changing pad!  I cut slits in it for the buckle and straps to go through, and it works TONS better.  Save your money on this one	0
This is great for keeping the sun out of my baby's eyes- from all angles. And those on window shades always fall off, and are annoying when you want to roll the window down.. This does the job just fine. Highly recommend it	1
"I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  ""Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the ""potty"" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway.""   I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else."	0
My boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it. It's fun and it's a miniature size adult potty. They love it. The seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already, but we are making it work. We have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger	1
"I bought this item because the FAQ on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib, including ones with solid headboards.  However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard.  Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following:

""The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it."" 

When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told:

""The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire.""

I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same.  Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ, however, I now am inconvenience with returning the item.   I am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product."	0

My son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates (he's broken two already...)  and so far, this one's holding up.  I would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it doesn't have an installation kit, but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well.  It swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut...  we use ours in the kitchen so it doesn't wake the babies up- however, if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping, it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep.

All in all, it's a really good deal and I would highly recommend this product"	1
I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser	0
I love this gate one because of the height. It is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble.  I also like that I can operate the Gate with only one hand.  That is great because like other Mom's my hands are often busy with something else.  I would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate	1
I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend.  However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces.  I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue.  The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks.  With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for. 	0
I purchased this sling from ebay for $8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it, we did just that.  It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product, and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it, I now COMFORTABLY, have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure.  I am petite and this is one size fits all, you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter.  If you have problems with the baby being secure, you just need to pull up the material high on the back (theirs and yours) AND tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand.  I am now VERY impressed with this product, a little knowledge goes a long way!  The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php  ~ once you see how to use this product correctly, you WILL LOVE IT!  :o)  I do now	1
I was very disappointed in the product.  The picture does not accurately represent the armoire.  The entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood, not cherry wood at all.  The pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet, in addition to the outside.  Also, pieces did come chipped, cracked and one piece was also split into two!!! I returned the item and wish I hadn't ordered in the first place	0
"I love these little books... they play music.. good for before bed, my girls can chew on them (which makes both me and my two year old son happy)...
Just fantastic... great buy"	1
This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless	0
Such a great product for my baby. She loves it as she can hear the music with me singing at the same time. It builds confidence for me singing so my baby loves that we sort of sing together. The plastic book is so gentle to be held by those tiny hands. Such a winne	1
I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment!  My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked.  if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one	0
"I absolutely love this walker. The songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained. I also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere. There are also great safety features such as the ""grip strips"" on the bottom. The wheels are very easily manuevered also. I would definitely recommend this product to other moms"	1
"I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child? 

My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.

I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though"	0
"My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right!  Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet.  First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off.  Especially when you get it on there just right.  Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners.  Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion?  Ugh, I don't think so.

I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have  my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it.

As far as the ""imprint"" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered"	1
This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts.	0
We have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night.  They are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach.  I gave it 4 stars because it's not extremely soft, though it isn't bad.  I also like that the top layer is breathable - gives me peace of mind	1
This was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm. BUT...the zipper does not work well and it broke already. I tried to repair it, but after that broke, the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix. I would not recommend this JJ Cole product as I had the same problem with another one we inherited	0
"I was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub.  She loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills.  The only down side is that the crayons get a bit ""mushy"" after a bit of time in the water.  But it the Baby Einstein crayons are a good replacement...which are inexpensive as well.  I look forward to many ""Van Gogh""s from her. "	1
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.	0
"I am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath, its getting him out that's the problem.  With the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas.

Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys!  My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet.  You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler, it also makes a great place to color.  Be careful to wash everything off before it dries."	1
I thought these would be great specially for the $ but I was soo WRONG!! I've only washed them once, to have everything clean b/f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls!! The fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls, way to many to even remove by hand- And on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam!!!It looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand-me-down after one wash!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!	0
My two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world. It's so easy to get him to take a bath now!  The crayons are great and come off the tub easily...I give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off. The compartment to  keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open.  Thank you for making this!	1
This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke	0
But, there are 2 things I don't like. One being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low. My sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old. Second being that the continuous play songs, don't actually continually play. It actually pauses for about 1-2 minutes. My son will fall asleep to the music, then it pauses and starts up again, waking him. i do love the vibration feature, which is the main reason i bought it. All in all, it is worth it	1
I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it	0
My daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out.  Then, we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic.  AMEN!  I don't care how many parts there are -- it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting	1
Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The &quot;strings&quot; used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative	0
"When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did!  My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies.

As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do"	1
After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you	0
"We love it!

Yes, the volume is low, but there's a very simple solution to that -- put it near your head.

The best things about this device are the AC adapter and the fact that it will run all night. I just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time (Our cat must think we live by the ocean now!)

A couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds. If this happens to you, turn it over and flip the switch off of DEMO mode -- it has the 5-second setting so you can try it out in the store. 

We're hooked on this thing now. I may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room."	1
I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product!	0
It's perfect for people without a lot of extra room.  It's very sturdy	1
Don't waste your money on this high chair.  By the time your infant can safely sit in it, they will have almost outgrown it.  You're just paying for the name brand, not the quality.  Stick w/ a Graco instead	0
"I was worried this looked cheap, and too sterile and hospital-like for my new baby, but it is much more attractive in person. Safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib, theirs looks dated. It arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble, by myself at 8 months pregnant! Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position. Click- Done! Has two adjustable height settings, and comes with a nice mattress. I would not order another one. This is very soft and suitable. This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly. The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft, love it! My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out. In fact I can't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives, since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs I saw in person at a local store. 

I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs, but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed. We bought one, but she doesn't want to stay in it at night. She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib. 

This crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib. This is a great product and very reasonable too!"	1
Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills	0
The Safety 1st Cosco Portable Crib is great!  I purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits.  It's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib.  It is very sturdy and also attractive	1
"Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, ""unacceptable"" because it's unsafe.  (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.)  Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay.  Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should.  CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling.  Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store.  Be sure to avoid model 14565"	0

"This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.  
  
 I can't GIVE this one away"	0
I am a new grandma.  The size and portability are a plus.  I was surprised that it came with a mattress.  I hadn't read that in the description	1
Maybe it's just me, but I can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature	0
[...] it def. is...very sturdy, doesn't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too :) i'm very happy with this chair - the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms...i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders. i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse...my son hasn't gotten food under there yet...i can't wait to use it as a booster seat :	1
I have looked EVERYWHERE and there are no probe covers to be found ANYWHERE!  Who would sell a $30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times!  This is insane.  If anyone finds them, please let me know where.  I have checked BabysRUs, USA Baby, Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, Snyder's Drugstores, every grocery store, every discount store, every drugstore I have been to in two states over the last 3 months.  This is crazy.  I recommend not getting it	0
"This product definitely saves space but I've had a hard time cleaning the tray. Yes, it's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand-washing it. There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I'm always finding places that I misseed washing. Trust me, the baby will manage to get food there too! 

This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing (I've seen this on some highchair models)."	1
"I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing - so I bought a lot. They aren't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers. Hope this helps others looking for covers for this. If the first years doesn't sell probe covers for this anymore - they shouldn't let companies sell the thermometer either.

I have yet to use this chair as I am a grandma awaiting the arrival of her first grandchild, but from what I can see, this high chair has everything a larger chair offers but in a lot less space! It is very sturdy and well put together and I am already recommending it to friends	1
"Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links.  
  
 The thermometer works well but without probe covers, it's not a good investment. You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers. If the store you're buying the thermometer at doesn't have covers there, find another product with covers available"	0
This chair is a great space saver. Attaches easily to the chair, has two cup holders and the tray is the size of a normal high chair. The draw back is it's hard to adjust the seat for the infant. Was able to with some effort	1
I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better.  I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item.  I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box.  Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed.  Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future	0
My son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now.  I'm sure they will be perfect once he grows into them	1
The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :	0
Being that we had our baby in December, this was a godsend. Instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat, my wife or I would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket. Works great	1
Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer	0
I bought this for my twin girls and i love it. I had them in September and they fit it in all winter. It was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming. Using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle. Once you're in the car and warm enough, all you have to do is unzip the sides and there's no fuss	1
I purchased this wipe warmer because I didn't want a warmer that heats all the wipes.  Those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless.  The top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes. Well, this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box.  It didn't even heat the whole wipe!  I am returning the warmer.  It is a complete waste of money	0
Absolutely LOVE this product!!  Wish I had had one for my other 3 children.  We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use.  There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it.  I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months.	1
First, I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby's sleep better.  That I cannot deny.  Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking.  However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk.  I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters.  She could have easily suffocated!  This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had).  Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product.  I have to tell you that that is not quite the case.  Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated.  The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either.  If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it.  I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down.  As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters. 	0
We got two Bundlemes for our twin infant sons. The product handles, wears and washes well. This product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates. The only problem we have come across: on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute	1
My daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time.  I even tried to put a towell to make it less steep, but it didn't work.  Worst yet, her head would slide off the edge.  I guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around	0
This is so much better than the Bjorn carrier.  You can wear it on the hip or in front.  It is very comfortable.  My baby always felt secure and I never thought he would come out.  I could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem.  My back and shoulders were never sore. Easy to put on.  Great way to calm a fussy baby!  Reversible black for men too	1
I like the concept of an elevated design.  They should make the sides breathable.  I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home.  This has been 6 weeks so far.  He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such.  Typical baby stuff.  He ends up slidding down in between the wedges.  I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up.  You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in.  He slides no matter what.  When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge.  Good Idea needs work	0
"I LOVE this pillow. I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly ""hang"" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable.

**UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash.  Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new. I also like that, yes, it does take up some room, but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows. All in all, whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice"	1
This product has been a disappointment. The pillow portion is good in theory only. The baby's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not! So the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right! Wouldn't recommend, good concept, bad design	0
After months of sleeplessness, I received this pillow as a gift from my mom. It is WONDERFUL, but not for the reasons I thought. I thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins (which it is), but the real relief is that I barely wake up as I flip from one side to the other, since it is nicely wedged between my knees	1
"My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.  It went together fine, but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT.  In fact, we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room.

Little Tykes makes this unit, but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction.  They told me just to return it and that they've never heard of this problem."	0
"I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go.  I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer.  I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with.  This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.  I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with.  Beware, my husband calls this the ""Sperm Pillow"", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow. "	1
The toy box is nice, but im not happy with the product. The directions were difficult to understand and I didn't like the top being made of cloth material. My little boy already made a tear on it. I had to remove it, I was afraid my little boy would tear it	0
This is a great potty for boys.  We had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty, in the potty.  Easy to clean, too	1
HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all	0
I spent quite some time online researching on a good, reasonable potty and found this product. It's a bestseller and even better - most of the buyers are very satisfied with it. It's functional, sturdy, easy to clean and seems comfy. My son had some success with that one. :-)	1
Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!	0
This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy.	1
"We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.  

Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. 

It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience.

We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one"	0
"I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book ""Potty training in less than a day"".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...]"	1
"My mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson. As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom, can be a very very exciting feeling.

When we recieved our dresser, we did not open it right away. Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box, to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half. 

We called stork craft and reordered the part. The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us. My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel. I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped. 

That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house. Til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel.

My suggestion- Please read every review before purchasing any items rom fSTORK CRAFT......... There furniture and customer service is not reliable. OUR BABIES DESERVE BETTER........... DON""T YOU THINK"	0
"I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair.  It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad.  I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with.  Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc.  

This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges.  It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin.  The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty.  It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with.  

I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys.  

This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe.  I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that"	1
I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail.  3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements.  They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks.  Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks.  How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces.  Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college.  We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough.  I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it. 	0
Very cozy--great for wrapping up after bath to get warm.  But honestly, it's usually in the laundry.  And since swaddling lasts for a short period of time, it's use is pretty limited.  However, when it Is clean, I like having it around. 	1
I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble	0
We have been swaddling our 8 week old since she came home from the hospital.  We tried the Swaddle Me, but I guess she was too small (7 lbs.) We were using the Miracle Blanket which we loved.  However, as she got stronger, she was able to kick and squirm her way out.  I got worried about her safety with a loose blanket in the crib, but she really liked being swaddled.  I took out the Swaddle Me that I received at a shower and decided to try it again.  It worked like a champ, and she is sleeping 7 hours at night now!!  I stretch it so that it's as tight as possible.  I bought another one, and the velcro for the feet is bigger - even better to hold it down.  We LOVE it and highly recommend!	1
THERE WAS A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND NICKS IN THE WOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY ONLY OFFERED US 20.OO FOR A DISCOUNT. VERY DISSASTISFIED! WILL NEVER ORDER FORM HERE AGAI	0
After I had my 2nd son, we bought a Graco double stoller, but it was SO long, heavy and cumbersome that I only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it.  We bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and I love it!  Great stoller, lightweight, easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back.  It's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too.  I wish that I had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment.  I highly recommend this stoller, but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller	1
Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it	0
I LOVE this product.  All new mothers should include this on their registry, how we've lived without it for this long, I'll never know!  It is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now	1
"I could go into a long explanation of how I searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself, who is a stay at home mom.  I could explain in detail about everything I did to try and get this pump to work, in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working, of how I was freaking out my supply was dwindling so I went out to buy fenugreek.....But, suffice it to say, the motor lasted me 3 months of once, twice a week useage.  It didn't completely die, which is why it took me a while to figure it out, but after paying attention, I could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when I couldn't even get a quarter ounce from one side and I was nearly engorged..!!!  

At least Medela is shipping me out a new motor, this one I hope will at least last longer.  Especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months (6 month total warranty- which to me is too little for a product that costs over $100!!)  Even though I'm staying at home and only use the pump occasionally, I wish I'd just spent the extra $150 and gotten a Pump in Style! "	0
When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing	1
I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I'm engorged and found out the motor is broken.  I'm very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name.  If I could afford it, I'd replace it with the Pump-in-Style, but unfortunately, I'll have to try a manual pump	0
"The only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty.  Otherwise they work really good.

I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.	0
This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller. It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close. However, once I figured that out, it was great. I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed. The swivel is a great concept. I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder (one on each side) and mommy could have her water bottle clip. We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles.	1
"This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up.

It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money"	0
"Seemed like a great system.  I came with TWO universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once.  If you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment.

I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target	0
I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way (boiling water in a pot on the stove) so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately. I loved that it was so effortless! PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage. No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child, so read the instructions. I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one. My only issue is that because of its small size (it has to fit in the microwave after all!!!!), you have to really stack the bottles, nipples, etc. in a way that utilizes all of the available space. Once again, the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack. So, if in your sleep deprived, hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache	1
I did not like this hammock.  It cuts across your neck and I do not feel like my son is securely in there.  I always have to have at least one hand holding him.  The front carriers are the way to go since they leave your hands free to do things	0
"I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great. Easy to use and quick to sterilise.

With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment, I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile. All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats (and breast pump equipment) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally. Cleaning your baby's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs, so it's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing. If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone, it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade. The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition. 

It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth, but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous. Your baby's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he'll be able to combat infections more easily. 

It might seem inconvenient to some, but sterilising reduces your baby's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it's about the baby's health, not what the mother's feels she doesnt have time for. "	1
"I thought I would love this but just returned it.  It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?)  Maybe I'm too small (5'2"")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large.  Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable.  I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing!  Very painful"	0
"Great product!  It makes your life a lot easier, not having to worry about boiling your bottles.  Please keep in mind that it is a ""sterilizer"", not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer.  Somehow, a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does"	1
How annoying to pay $25 more here than at Walmart. Same price at Babies R Us. Is it really the same exact thing? Very frustrating.	0

Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps.  I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat.  That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat.	0
Whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler.  My grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity. YES, activity.  At a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving; no moving, no peek-a-boos! It contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby.  A good value at any price	1
"Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward, loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat. Since this happened he's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place...just by loosening the harness.Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product. I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this.

"I tried to put this oven ""lock"" on my oven. Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick.

I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place.  Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there.  Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck.  In the trash it went.

I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle.  So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4"" of the adhesive strip on the oven.  Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door.  In the trash it went as well.

I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens.  :"	0
We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house	1
The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail	0
"This sensor is all about peace of mind.  We've been using it for a few weeks now and it's gone off twice - scaring us, but making us glad that we have it.  Both times that its gone off, our daughter has been very tightly swaddled, so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm.  You can change the sensitivity on it, but the default setting should be fine.  

There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear.  My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes.  It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise.  

It does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib, otherwise the sensor will go off.  But this `inconvenience' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you.  

I believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two.  Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room, to the living room, etc.  

This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny."	1
Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants, it is not high enough and very combersome to use. Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub. HOWEVER, the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger	0
I am not an expert in anything. I am an emergency room nurse though, and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS.  We thought we'd try this product as the reviews are great. We love it. The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration! I would highly recommend this for every baby, as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age. I feel so much better, knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing. We plan to take this with us when we travel. It is easy to use and it really works. If you buy the one with the two parent units, you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead, or as well	1
I inherited this product from my neightbor last week.  I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it.  I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart.  I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used.  What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily	0
The Hello Kitty Chair was just adorable, the quality and craftmanship is outstanding. My 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking. Its just the right size. Thank Yo	1
I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price	0
I shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach, for my sons first visit. I found this one, and let me tell you, it was perfect! It was so easy to set up and take down, and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds. I saw a lot of other tents/cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best; both price and durability wise. Excellent find and buy	1
I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son.  It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub.  It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub.  The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub.  There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub.  He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth.  There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay.  His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while.  I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured. 	0

"We love the Diaper Dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family!  It is SUPER simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2-3 months vs. a week (i.e. Diaper Genie)!

From reading the other reviews, I think I can clear a few things up - it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product.  First, there are 2 versions of this pail - a larger called DIAPER DEKOR PLUS and regular size called simply DIAPER DEKOR. Thus, there are 2 different sizes of refills, PLUS and REGULAR.  You can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail - there is a sticker that will have the model on there - if you do not see PLUS anywhere, you will need to buy REGULAR refills - the PLUS will not fit, and vice versa.

Secondly, the refills are VERY easy to insert, you simply follow the directions which come with the unit.  Basically, you remove the plastic insert, wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top - the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail - knot tied in the bottom of the new refill.  If you have a unit, this will make sense - if you haven't bought one yet, I probably just confused you - but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do!

Last but not least, the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all - I personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent.  It's not like I will be sniffing inside the pail or anything, so it doesn't matter - afterall, once the refill is in the pail, NO SCENT will come out - not even dirty diapers!

Unfortunately, it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores.  I hope this has helped!  We've had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it!  It is a GODSEND!  No smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing!  Not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent"	1
I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier. This bag was ok to start and fit my britax (a feat in itself) BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE. I would not buy it. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back	0
"Diaper Dekor is the small, plus is the larger. There are TWO sizes--+ won't fit the smaller unit. We have the smaller and our Babies R Us (which is where we bought it) says ""oh sorry, we only carry the big ones now."" Nice! Now we have to buy liners online. I don't mind buying online but I don't appreciate that I can't go buy them where I bought the unit. If I'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we'd have bought +. It's excellent"	1
Recieved the gate with parts missing.  When I notified Amazon, they indicated repair/replacement parts were not available and I would have to return and reorder the product.  As my wife needed it, this was not possible.  This is not a reflection of Amazon but on hte manufacturer	0
When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size.  However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one.  My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem!  I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them.  I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes	1
Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it	0
I bought the smaller version &quot;Diaper Decor&quot; (as opposed to the larger &quot;Diaper Decor Plus&quot;) about 18 months ago.  Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon.  I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor.  It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me.  I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size	1
I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week.  One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams.  So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it.  I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams.  So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand.  To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine.  I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective.  Good luck if you decide to order this	0
"Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents. 

I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic"	1
This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortabl	0
"This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still ""shoot"" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the ""projection path"" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too."	1
I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy	0
This is the best potty seat that you can buy.  It's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard.  Also, I love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall	1
"I was very disppointed in this product. I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer, but this was the only good quality. I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching. You could smell the plastic in the milk. I'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals, especially when her liver isn't developed enough to fully detoxify them.
I really wanted to love this product, but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option"	0
my son loves this jumper.  it gives him a sense of independence.  he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around	1
"1. they leak
2. too expensive
3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers
4. doesn't work well for feedin"	0
"I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care.  It has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other.  The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house!
I would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children.  It will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along"	1
I have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time I reached home.	0
  we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews.  I would have to say that it does work well.  The only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom.  Also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor.  It has given me peace of mind that I don't have to run in every sound she makes. I can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me.  I would recommend this product	1
I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles	0
I am a disposable diaper mom, however, for night time or extra protection I throw the bummis wrap over the diaper and have never had a leak.  They wash up very nice and the velcro stays very strong.  It is by far the best wrap I've used	1
"I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.  

One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately.  Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get.  Another waste of money from Avent."	0
When registering for baby needs I laughed at the idea of wipes warmer - I thought what a waste! After my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes I rethought this. This product has been a life changer! Baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great. Easy to use, the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out. Remember to purchase the pop-up wipes however. Great product. I would give as a gift.	1
I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.	0
"I was that parent who said ""I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer."" And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product."	1
They are messy when they opened. I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much. I don't have much room in my freezer. when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate... it's like $17 for ten :-	0
I have not gotten to use this swing yet, but I just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after I had it all put together I played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever:)  I highly recommend	1
I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.	0
We got this when our baby was about 6 months old, he is now 9 months.  At first, he wasn't sure what to do, but once he figured out how to jump in it, it was all he wanted to do.  The adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it.  It's a little awkward to move around, but the enjoyment well out-weighs that.	1
Great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction.  It would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table ...really	0
This jumper is worth it's weight in gold. My son is 3 1/2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so I decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion. At first he was a little wobbly, but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around. I have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper. I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy	1
I am returning my Roxy safe seat!  It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door....The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat.  At a grocery store, the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries.  Its not worth the hastle.  I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.  The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place.  Sorry GRACO, the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	0
Our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first, but now that she's 4 months old, she loves this toy! We recommend it!	1
"Graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over $100 for something that appears to be made with less than $20 worth of materials. The seat is MUCH too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 Nissan Sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer, but much more inconvenient. 

The documentation, in my opinion is very poor, and I've installed Linux systems from scratch w/ less documentation... Bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don't completely understand the instructions.

Let's not talk about the styling... wasn't black, red and gray popular in the 80's or did I miss the come back somewhere...

I hope I can find something better... I'm giving this product TWO stars because it will do the job... but I expect much more from a product"	0
Great, fun product. My baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min. couple times a day. We own it from 2 months, he was 4 months old, he simply loves it. He jumps and plays with the toys. Absolutely the best buy	1
Do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet. The tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	0
"These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry.  I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra, and I didn't have a huge leakage problem, so I changed the foam twice a day.
The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it.  I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them.  Bottom line: the relief was worth any minor inconvenience"	1
"Well, we ordered this for a trip and it's ""delayed"" even though it says it's in stock.  We got a vauge email that says ""delayed"" but no promise of delivery.... don't order it from Amazon if you're exhausted chasing an escaping baby!  Go to a local store and purchase it........waiting.......waiting.......waiting......"	0
I highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born...if you plan on breastfeeding. I was very sore in the first few weeks. The shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings. I did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks. But they got me through those weeks when I don't know if I'd have made it otherwise! They were a wonderful product for me	1
This mirror really isn't worth the money.  You'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby, that's about all this thing does.  The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror, kinda hard to do driving down the road.  Also, the music isn't very loud, atleast not loud enough to get baby's attention when upset, which is what I was hoping for.  And the lights aren't very bright.  Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out.  Also, the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards, but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat, it doesn't stay in place that well.  You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror	0
You will need this extra base!! I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have. The day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and couldn't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up. I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened	1
"I was very disappointed in this mirror.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all. 

I registered for this because of the remote control feature. Well, the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit ""on"" (remote control access mode) in order for it to work.  There's a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music. You cannot control that feature from the remote control. You also cannot control the volume from the remote. It's really a pain.  I'm keeping it because I like the mirror but I'm not happy with it.  Save your money and buy the SafeFit Baby In Sight mirror."	0
We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel.  It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car.  I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars.  I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone	1
I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!	0
I purchased this product for my hubby's vehicle and we LOVE not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time. It works great, highly recommended	1
With the rear-facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan, this mirror limits driver visability.  When the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror, a large section of the back windshield is blocked.  I'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror	0
I bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great! Now I don't have to switch the whole seat when Mom takes the baby. I am very happy with this purchase	1
I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.  The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first.  My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor	0
My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter, and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand-new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat. We were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law, one to my sister-in-law, and keep the third for my husband's car, but then we realized that more than likely, if we brought the baby over to their homes, chances are the baby would already be in his car seat.  We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately! This way, we can bring our son to Grandma's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another. The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage, too. Plus, the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt. A must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby	1
I don't even know where to begin. Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids. (1 1/2 and 6 months old) Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him, she would cover her face and cry! He would go off all by himself, which was really creepy in the middle of the night. And he broke after a couple of months. Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house. He's defantly not worth the mone	0
I reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers! I had a Generic diaper throw away system It was awful! This is so easy to use once you get the hang of it. and it really keps the smell away! Try it. you'l like it	1

"Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!

I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual.

I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before. Needless to say fabric doesn't protect leather very well. I ended up with deep depressions in the leather. Hopefully the leather will go back (fingers crossed). The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.	1
Bought these for my Nikon D200 about 3 months ago. Never having used Tiffen before I took a chance on a recommendation. Vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse I've seen. Build quality of all the filters is really not very good. Going to go back to Hoya's which are much better	0
"The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them. They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt. I own a minivan, so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan, I would consider a different brand. Good luck.

This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained.  For starters, kids like using the same seat as mom and dad..this seat allows them to do that comfortably. It is not too big and not too small, fits any toilet and travels like a dream. As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free. And with boys, there is usually a little mess, but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily.  I love it, and my son loves it. I wish I hadn't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it..only this seat	1

"I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.  
The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign.
The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.
The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason"	0
Even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning , it fits perfecly. Evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it. We needed this piece for our size opening , we really had to squeeze it in , but it is a great fit. The gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye. It took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism , using 2 hands at first. After some practice it was easy to use. We liked it so much that we bought another .	1
This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	0
I need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room.  It's used for an office and playroom, and it's the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open.  My daughter's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell, so I bought this one.  It took 7 minutes to install, it's not going anywhere, and it's very easy to open and close.  My dogs can't climb over it because the bars are vertical.  I love it, am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter's bedroom	1
The bag is suppose to hold two cameras,I have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries. I recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here. might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not SL	0
We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size. He was sleeping through the night almost immediately. Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled. We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free. A def must have for every baby	1
I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-	0
My daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks.  She got very used to being swaddled, but after 4 kids I still can not do it right. This blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old. When both the blankets were in the wash she wouldn't sleep that long. She was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held. Thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep	1
I paid extra for Air Next Day service.  Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  Item eventually arrived two weeks later.  I had left for a trip.

I won't buy from Willoughby's again	0
This product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home.  While others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes, I found that I could keep it velcro'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom.  My daughter really liked this, but quickly outgrew it.  At just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down, so the usefullness of the product is limited.  For a baby who loves being swaddled, this is an indispensible item.  I'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs.  You never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled	1
They sent me wrong lens cover and said I ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since I got copy.......poor customer service all around.....	0
"I loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap!  It was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart.  The velcro worked really well as it gave ""room to grow.""

"I love this sling!  But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.  

I've found the key is wear it high!  The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height.  It's true!  If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she's going to squirm and be uncomfortable.  

I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving.  Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he's in it he falls asleep, no matter the time of day.  If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he'll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won't hear a peep out of him the whole trip.

And you have to admit it's so cute and stylish!  Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon! "	1
"When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. 
After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. 
The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!
They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera."	0
First, I must say that this sling was an absolute LIFESAVER when my (somewhat colicky) son was a newborn.  No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it.  Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it.  One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded.  I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder.  In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder.  Good use for a mitten that's lost it's mate, but I would rather have a better strap	1
"I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:

-I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!
-The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.

Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30."	0
I am 5'5 with a large bust size and had a 7lbs 7 oz baby.  It took a couple times to find the most comfortable way for me to wear it but after that I have had no problems with it.  My son will get in there and go straight to sleep and I have never felt he was going to suffocate.  The pockets are a major plus and now since it is cold and flu time of the year I like it because all the touchy and coughing people can not touch him with any germs they may have since he is completly covered up.  He is still laying down in it so I don't know how it will work with him sitting up.   	1
"Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.
 
Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, ""it is Canon, it must be quality.""  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.

We have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars.  This was the perfect solution because you can place the tie-down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long, so they will fit around large or small bars.  We had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with wouldn't reach, but it was very easy to do.  I also like this product because it doesn't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision	1
"As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)

The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months"	0
We were very pleased with how easy this was to install, despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters.  Ours is actually a half wall and half banister, but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge.  The directions weren't great, but it was fairly self explanatory.  We feel much more comfortable letting our one-year old play upstairs in the loft now	1
"I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the ""female"" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.

I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black ""spring"" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.

I use this cord with a Stroboframe ""portrait/landscape"" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.

When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.

I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  

Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords"	0
This product has really worked well for me!  My daughter used to love pushing her Barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below!  Now we don't have to worry about this anymore.  She can't reach her arm through these posts anymore either.  I use window cleaner to clean the smudge	1
I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.	0
I had checked out booster seats on the Internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive.  It's a bargain -- well made and easy to use.  My grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair.  The seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair.  When I wrote customer service about the problem, they sent a whole new booster seat	1
Beware of  assuming that  the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct  size.  It wasn't even close.  No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it	0
Excellent value for money. Our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we wouldn't have managed the holidays without it!  This seat is strong and stable, yet easily assembled/dis-assembled.  It folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family.  We purchased this on 19 Dec and it was delivered prior to Christmas - well done Amazon	1
I agree with the previous review.  The deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out	0
Seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical!  My niece absolutely loved them.  She had such an easy time handling them because they are her size, which is unusual.  All other instrument toys are so much larger and it's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them! The smiles and giggles are worth everything	1
This kit is just junk. The &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges	0
My eight-month-old daughter really loves these instruments! We bought them when she was about four months old, but when she picked them up she'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around.  I brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control.  Now she really goes wild with them, especially the bells!	1

My daughter plays with this toy at Grandma's house. Theses &quot;instruments&quot; are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with. The bright colors and different noises definitely interest her. She loves to shake them and make noise. They are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you're on the go	1
I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro. 	0
My daughter received these instruments as a gift last Christmas and took to them right away.  She was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds.  We have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites, just the right colors, size and shape with just the right sounds!  She has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys.  They really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children	1
For nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5X) magnification.  It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I sent this product back. 	0
Perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome.  For the price, it has alot to offer.  It has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks, moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes.  It's not the plushest stroller, however, for travel or quick errands it's perfect for us	1
Description or product is wrong.  There is no quad independent power/charging indicators.  They are set up in banks of two.  One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two.  Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable.  Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	0
I gave this stroller as a gift. So far there have been no problems.	1
"The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s.
Just setting the D200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the SB800/Masster & SB600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.

The SB800 is designed for this purpose. So why not include information on how to do this?"	0
"I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily. I didn't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space, but they are also very heavy. This stroller is light, and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand. Plus, because my kids are heavy enough to push, I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller. Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door.  

My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems. The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing, but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down, so you can angle them with the sun. I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger, more expensive, heavier tandem stroller"	1
I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one	0
"My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds! I love the rain! even I fall asleep listening to it.
I had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter. So I block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker :)  I am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby!!!!!!!"	1
"I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...
Save money and buy 5XX series flash.."	0
I think this product is fantastic, the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing. The timer is also a nice feature. This is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby. The sheep is cute and  surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it's tummy.	1
"At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.

Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens"	0
"A good friend has this for her daughter. I fell in love with it when I saw it. Completely adorable and works like a charm. 

Bought one as a baby gift as well, but I'd kinda like one myself..."	1
"This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.

I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    

In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon. "	0
It's very safe because of the non-slip rubber. Our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes to the potty. Nice color too. Highly recommended!!	1
This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it. 	0
"Other parents told us about these, specifically the vanilla scented ones.

Baby #1 was bottle fed and took to an Advent pacifier right away.  We used the scented soothies whenever we couldn't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes.  Not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent, but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting the bottle ready.

Baby #2 was also bottle fed, but did not take to any pacifier right away.  We tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the Advent ones too.  She eventually took to the Advent.

It really is up to each baby what they will like.  But these are definately worth trying.  In addition to the regular and vanilla ones, there are also various sizes, including preemie, pacifiers attached to small stuffed, plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth...and also easier for Mom & Dad to in the back of the car, the darkened bedroom, etc"	1
"I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.

Later, I decided on the Tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  The salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when I told him I had this Canon lens.  He said, ""let me guess, you'd like to try the Tamron 17-50/2.8.""  He said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. I could return it with no questions asked if I wasn't satisfied.  He also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  

My first images with this lens were great.  They were SHARP and had way more vibrant color.  There is absolutely no comparison at all.  I was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon.  I was so dissapointed that I wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  After spending $$$ on a digital SLR, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  Before taking a chance on buying the Canon, do yourself a BIG favor and try the Canon and Tamron at a local store.   "	0
The booster works great, does not slip on a chair, and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own.  I highly recommend this product	1
"I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to ""unwind,"" causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a ""Photo / Video"" tripod.  

Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.

Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.

If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.

That's why I give this one 2 stars"	0
Finally a cute pink car seat.  It is duralble and easy to lift around. I wish they had this cute color for my other daughter.

I am not wild about the colors and design, but it's not too bad.  The fabric is easy to clean (machine-washable) and the sun canopy is GREAT!

"I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?

It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.
Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. 

This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.

Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.

"We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it. 

1. It was simple to assemble.
2. It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer.
3. The air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter.
4. The toy steering wheel? She FREAKS out over it, in a good way. She *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store. Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves, I am ultra pleased. 
5. The price is wonderful.

We don't use the Music On The Move feature, so I can't really comment on it. I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time, and it's not hard to do, so I have no complaints there.

This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	0

Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses:
Canon 10-22mm
Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version)
Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it. 

The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too. 

You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens."	0
I think everyone should one of these, especially for when their kids are young.   My 8mo. old tries to eat everything.   I don't want him chewing on the handlebars of grocery cars (yuck!) and it makes it much cleaner when you put him in a highchair at restaurants (which are sometimes disgusting).   The best part it fits over extra large shopping carts at club stores, like [...], unlike other types	1
The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself	0
"I didnt know these things exsisted with my first child, now that I found them I use it constantly! This floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper, but in the long run this is the best for your money! I have washed it at least half a dozen times, and its washes great! I also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair. THe other products I saw you had to buy one for each item. It was almost double the cost.
It does take a few minutes to get it hooked up, but its worth it for the quiet and GERM free shopping experience, and my son is so ccomfy in it! I have had lots of people ask me where we got it.
I love the added extras of having a cup holder pocket and some places to hook up some toys.
It is very plush and made of great fabric, it is not cheap in anyway.
THis is one item I dont intend to live without, I also think this is a great shower gift for anyone expecting!
I cant say enough about this product"	1
"""You get what you pay for""

Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.

I was hoping the same of this product from all the ""glowing"" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.

Here are it's bad points:

-The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.

-The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.

-The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.

In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod"	0
The Floppy Seat is a great item... No more worrying about baby's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs.  I recommend this to all new moms and give it an A++	1
"Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was ""refurbished"" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for ""refurbished"" items is less than 6 months"	0
I cannot go shopping without my floppy seat!  I don't know what I am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy.  I reccommend this to everyone who comments on it, to purchase for themselves or as a gift.  I have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on, or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection, but I can't remember where (babycenter.com, $60?). As other reviewers mentioned, I also used mine for the restaurants too, when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats (not to mention the gunk in the chairs!).  Buy this product - you won't be dissapointed	1
"I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. 

-Positives-
fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.

The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.

that's about it.

-Negatives-
The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.

The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.

Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.

It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).


I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak"	0
"We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old.  Even though he was still a little ""floppy"" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong!  Although, now he wears ""real"" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast!  

We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat.  As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair.  The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts!  We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!"	1
Canon's 28-135mm with IS (Image Stabilizer) is a far better choice for the money	0
I am very happy with this potty.  It has a high guard which works well for a little boy. 	1
"Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! 

With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.

WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!"	0
My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this, but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up (which I LOVE the idea of).  It seems comfy, he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :	1
"I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to ""radio control"" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. 

If you need a ""cable release,"" I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time."	0
Kissaluvs are the best! They keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable.  Baby's skin doesn't get red like it does with disposable diapers.  Also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops.	1
I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazo	0
"This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns. The setup isn't quite as easy as the description implies, simply because the instructions are all pictures, without corresponding written directions. That said, a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward.

The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go. I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won't leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me.

The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music. An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration, music/noise, and lighting. There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep. The music is NOT, however, directly attached to the mobile. Also, the mobile sits on its own; it does not turn. That bothered me at first, but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn't seem to care anyway.

The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I've seen, making diaper changes much easier on the back. The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes. The changing table is padded and easy to clean up, though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort, as there isn't a removable pad on it. This is actually to my preference, as it's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with, but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning.

When taking this on the go, as I said, it's easy to pack up. One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard. It doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit all the components of the yard. The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go. The reality is, if I'm travelling, it's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about. However, I'm not sure how I'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself. I consider that a very minor consideration though.

This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I'm not having to constantly run to the nursery. I'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for (they look like little soft-sided cup holders), but I've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths, a pacifier, and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else."	1
"You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.

During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.

On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.

Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality"	0
This seat, along with the matching step stool are great!  My daughter loves having her very own, special toilet seat and step for going potty.  It has encouraged her to potty train, it fits the toilet seat nicely, and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself.  I put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty, and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well. 	1

We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants. The toilet trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start	1

"My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty. She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty. 

It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom). 

I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer"	1
I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen.	0
This stool is great, right size for young child to seat on the potty. It is narrow and doesn't take up a lot of room, plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty	1

I have a 10 month old baby and I have tried EVERY BOTTLE. I used the AVENT with my 1st baby. THESE BOTTLES ARE THE BEST! Why? Because they DO NOT LEAK, NO BUBBLES and the DESIGN is fabulous once the baby holds it her/himself. The angles top is great for LITTLE or NO AIR IN BABY'S TUMMY. The little rubber seal/disk you put in the bottom is a CINCH! Don't wast time or money$$$ on any other bottle	1
"The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware!
Canon, here I come!"	0
These are really good bottles.  I have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son.  My only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns.  The flow is MUCH too slow.  My little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried.  So if you plan on using these bottles, I would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby.  I am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples.  Other than that, these bottles are great	1
"I had my Sony DSC W70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit. The glass itself was intact, but something underneath was clearly broken. Mailed it in to the factory service company for Sony, and I was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair. This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially. 

I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera."	0
"The pacified pod isn's ""essential"", but it's definitely good to have. You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom's bag, or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk. And with all the cute patterns, you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag"	1
The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it	0
Medela products are all great--these containers came sterile and are so convenient to store pumped milk--one can add the medela nipple and feed the baby directly from the container. Very useful! Highly recommended	1
Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for	0
"True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5""-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor. 

My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes.

"This item works for me perfect.  I had ordered two of them, but found one did so well I have returned the second one.  There was nothing wrong with it, I just had no need for it.

"I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.

The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good"	0
My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate	1

I chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby.  I'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold.  Very good quality product	1
"Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:
 * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.
 * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.
 * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.
 * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.

This chair is larger than some of the seats out there, and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well. Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use, as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats! The seat is shaped just right for splashes, and it seems comfortable. Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day, we'd be in business! I love the simple design, my son loves the color (he picked it out himself), and it's so simple to clean. It also has grips on the bottom so that it won't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must	1
Just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier Casio models. Presently in Iraq, I do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. Sad. It looked to be a great camera	0

"I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.

The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the ""film"" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens.

They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro.

As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.

Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens?

The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.

These are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night. They wash up nicely and seem as good as the day I bought them. My only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro. They stick to other things in the wash. I think this puts extra wear on the velcro too	1
After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots). 	0
I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I've actually done it.  I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work, but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day... not hard.  These diaper covers are fantastic.  I have not had a single leak with them.  When my daughter was first born, a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks, and we had numerous leaks.  We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now.  She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born.  I use the chinese prefold diapers with them.  I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold, but they're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated.  What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don't have to hand wash them or anything	1
"I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. 

Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. 


Cons:

In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.

Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).

The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. 

Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.

The 420EX flash is supposed to ""talk"" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. 

After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.

Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.

So would I recommend this camera:
If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere"	0
Item is exactly as pictured/described.  Cute design and good quality.  Adds a nice touch.  Highly recommend	1
Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all	0
We are using this bather for our son who is one month old. What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby.  The fabric is also very soft, quick drying, and removable for machine washing.  The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby's waist.  To keep him warm, we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath.  Since we don't fill up the tub with water, slippage has not been a problem	1
I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.	0
I like this product very much. It is very soft, unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head. The only drawback I have about is the belt....maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant. Other than that I  would recommend it to anyone. It looks very comfortable too. Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system	1
"When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!

Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon"	0
"My 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs, so right from the very beginning, he's been in the big tub with a tub seat. He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU ""house"" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch.

I can't say enough good things about this tub seat. The head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn's delicate head, and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows. The two-position back reclines for newborns, and sits up straighter for older babies. The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub, but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water (in the old tub seat, he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in). One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn't sit up in it. The design of the Mother's Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted, and the ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself on the hard edges. Even though there's lots of support and padding, it's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this (or any) tub seat. 

Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I'd like to respond to: 
*There are no suction cups on the base: I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction, but tubs may vary. 
*She would like a strap: the seat that I have does have a strap (it's stored underneath the seat, so may not be immediately identifiable), so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently.

Overall, my son and I are very happy with this tub seat, and I've been recommending it to friends. They'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down, though. I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it!"	1
"I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.

Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting"	0
We bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly. This one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again. I also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean.	1

I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about	0
"I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don&acute;t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price. 
  
 Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed, also suffication could be a problem. 
 We have bought a convertable crib (common in Europe) which can be used till approx. age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later. 
 anyhow we still love it. it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari. "	1
"After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read ""e18"".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18"", and you'll see what I meant.

"It seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after I hit the purchase button. It arrived in great condition, too, and they even threw in a sippy cup!  ;-)   

The fabric on this cover (the Ashley Floral) is very attractive. I love that it can be rear- or forward-facing. A friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car, and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she's getting this one, once her newborn is too big for her rear-facing-only seat. If only she'd bought this one, she said, she wouldn't have to go buy another.

I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me	0
This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair.  I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair.  However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything.  I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage.  Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair.  If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs	1
"After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.

This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight!

Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again"	0
"I bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son, and he loves it (whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs).  It's a great size, easy to use, good color for hiding stains, and comfortable for him to sit in.  Best of all, because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag, we can be sure that he doesn't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat!

This is an excellent product, and well worth the money"	1
For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good	0
"      Limited space in our townhome, and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us. This is our ""highchair"".  Make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table.  The chair arms (attachments) may not clear the lip.
      Strong, sturdy, easy to clean.  Knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about. Great travel drawstring bag.
      Great price!!!  Great product.  If you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that shouldn't be forced, this seat will work out for you.
     Something for the manufacturers, if they read these comments... personnal prefrence.  The harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat.  Very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat, and its 5:00 in the morning"	1
I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake	0
I discovered this product recently when I had my second baby.  I received it as a baby shower gift and I LOVE it.  It is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket. I have now bought the large one and my son (3mos) has yet to figure out how to get out of it.  The other thing that I like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby's waist or upper chest, leave his arms out, and use it during the day like a blanket.  Voila, a blanket that won't fall off when you're holding him, or be kicked off when he's lying down.  Kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products.  You might also want to check out the Piddle Pad.  Another great invention/product by Kiddopotamus	1
"This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.

After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this.

I loved this!  He was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space.  It folds up smaller than a pack and play, takes up very little room next to the bed, and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos (or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby	1

We loved the mini co sleeper!  Our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy.  I loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed.  I could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and I didnt even have to roll out of bed.  The mini co sleeper was so portable that I never even bought a pack n play.  We traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us.  I highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high.  I will use this for our next baby as well	1
This gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my Mark II body properly.	0
This  bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed. It feels so good knowing he's so close.

Oh yeah, and its really cute	1
"These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain:

Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the LCD screen. I shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so I'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) I always show the subjects their photos after I take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. For further clarification, I'm Asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities.

I run around a lot when I shoot. So the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. I got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where I was, but the second time, I wasn't so lucky. So what did I do? I purchased another one. Not only did I have to purchase the extender, I had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. Another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. I didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, I upgraded to the 30D.

If you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. However, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my Canon Backpack. For some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera.

Another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day.

I guess I'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30D; I'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10D"	0
My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top.  He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention.  I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated.  At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort.  Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested.  Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not.  Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort	1
OK, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the LCD screen as much.  The MOST annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  Both my 30D and Rebel XT.  If I am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually I will not be reminded I wasted money on this accesory	0
I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!	1
"I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.

Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless"	0
We haven't used this set yet because our baby is due in June, but have set it up in our crib. The fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking.  The bumper fits well in our crib, and the tags say all the fabrics are 100% cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100% polyester.   We are very happy with this set for our future little girl	1
Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses. 	0
This is the best carseat out there. It's above the Peg Perego and Britax. It weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm and it is so easy to adjust. The best feature is the base is designed so that it does NOT MOVE in the car. I've had Graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when I made turns because they just weren't secure even with the special belt clip. The only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it's job. 5 stars!!!	1
The frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my PC.  My major complaint is the power supply.  The original power supply dies after 4 months.  It was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  The raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  I then had to buy one.  That one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  After months of waiting from them to stock the item I gave up and after lots of searching on the web I found a supply made by another compay.  I had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  It's been doing fine since then.  I should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  It looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  I would do a lot of shopping before buying this one	0
"When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep"	1
The 5x7 digital photo frame from Pacific Digital is very cheaply made, the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly.	0
"I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. 

My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view.

An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier"	1
It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	0
"I absolutely recommend this infant seat!  My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat.  It is fabulous for it's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it's roominess.  My son is on the chunky side, being an exclusively breastfed baby.  He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool.  The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying..""what a ride!"".  Well it is, quite a ride.  If you buy this car seat, it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby's life.  Thank you Graco"	1

I thought I would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore!  I saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when I started to breastfeed.  I placed the gelpads on, and within two hours, I could see the healing begin.  I tried olive oil nipple cream, and didn't even want to try anything with lanolin because I read it wasn't good to ingest,and it did not help at all. This is a great way to sooth nipples naturally.  Just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk (natural oils), and then place the pads on the nipples.  they are LIFE SAVERS.  I think I only needed three pairs, until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding (about 2-3 weeks).  DON'T GIVE UP!  Try these first, these work	1
I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls	0
They're a little pricey, but they work great. They are easy to clean, dry quickly, and catch almost all the mess my boys make	1

Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more.

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.	0
This is my favorite sheet for our daughter's crib.  It is a soft knit material and it washes up so well.  It fits easily onto the matress and I have never had a problem with it coming loose.  It is also such an adorable print	1
"I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'

I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.

That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.

What else can I say about this camera:

This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.

It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.

I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.

When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?

I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.

There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star"	0
I used this pump with my first child 2 years ago.  I tried to avoid paying the $300+ for the electric pump, and this worked great!  I pumped when I returned to work, and pumped for 3 months.  I loved not having to lug around the big electric pump to and from work every day.  It's much easier to clean than other manual pumps (e.g. gerber) because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower.  The pump has a strong suction, so I've had no problem expressing milk (e.g. up to 8 ounces or more each time).  I just had my 2nd child a month ago, and already I'm able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once.  I highly recommend this, especially for occasional users, no need to spend lots of money on fancy pumps with lots of removable, breakable parts.  Also, I am small chested, so no, you don't have to be well endowed for this to work	1
I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??	0
I bought this pump after the Avent Isis failed me along with an electric pump. The fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great. Im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes. Although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy. From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable. Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply. If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby. And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday.	1
I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again	0
I too was given this pump by a lactation nurse, I pump at night after my baby goes to sleep. I think the pump is Great! It does what I need it to do and it very comfortable. The only drawback is that is is kind of loud. I would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally.	1
"Hello All,

Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one"	0
I bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield.  I had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and I wasn't able to get a drop out because the shields didn't stay in place.  if you have biggre breasts I would suggest using this pump	1
Wow... Now if you really want to see a rip-off, here it is. Not to be damaging to Amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun. The hood is definitely not worth it	0
The only bottles my daughter would take were the Playtex Original Nursers. I am pumping at work with a Medela Pump in Style, so I was pumping into the Medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the Playtex Drop-ins to feed her. It was a hassle and I never felt like all of the milk, especially the fat, made it from the Medela bottles into the Drop-ins. And then I heard about this kit and bought two immediately - I have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the Drop-ins. The only downside: you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump	1
It's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood.  How can you pay $75 for a great prime lens, and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	0

I really love this system and find it has met all my needs.  My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle.

I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula!

I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers.

I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.  This reduces the space needed.  When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple.  Easy!  "	1
Boy, this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens.  It's a great a lens, but this is hardly worth the price	0
"I love love loooooove this system! I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago. Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc. 
With this system, I just pump right into the liners. They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go. I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners, instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm, PLUS a playtex system.
Overall, this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true. However, the liners themselves have ounce markings on them. Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner. Easy!
I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk (if you store a lot of it). It would get too expensive for my tastes. I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage. Make sure you get two, because each box only comes with one pump adapter.
Highly recommended by one happy mamma"	1
The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.	0
"We had the Britax Roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them, especially with the safety ratings.  When my older daughter was ready for a booster, the choice was easy -- BRITAX!  My daughter loves her booster.  When I first got it in the mail (we live overseas) I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn't like the side supports, but she loves them! 
I would like to comment on two previous comments....boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn't be used on an airplane.  Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts.  Second, you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat.  It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt.  I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great....and SAFE product"	1
A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP	0
This seems to be a secure seat, and our almost-5-year old is comfortable in it.  The buckling system is a bit inconvenient - you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped.  I wish our son could buckle himself in at this point, but this seat makes it too hard.  It's also not a seat you want to do air travel with, as it's unwieldy to carry around.  But, all in all I would say it's a good purchase	1
"This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.

The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.

I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon"	0
The crib arrived much sooner than I was quoted.  I was told 3 weeks, it came in 4 days.  Very prompt. It is a beautiful crib, I love it.  The directions are a bit lax.  It took my husband and I two hours to put it together. Mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer, and not the rest of the crib!  We finally figured it out.  Other than that the crib is beautiful	1
"Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.

Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.

these are the greatest invention in bottles...ever.....these bottles helped my daughter so much....no more gas,no spills or leaks...the only downside is they are hard to clean..but who cares...	1
While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version	0
"I have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity.  At first, I was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok.  So I took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby, ... it stopped ticking.  The baby was not moving, but just it's heart and/or lungs working keeps the unit ticking.  It detects even when you blow on the sensor.  Maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity, since ceiling fans, etc might activate it, but I was truly amazed with the sensitivity.
You can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome, it is like a clock ticking, about once a second when baby is ok, if it stops ticking for about 30 seconds.. a noticeable alarm will ring."	1
"Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.
 
Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, ""it is Canon, it must be quality.""  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.

PROS: 
Can be used for film or digital cameras 
Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting 

CONS: 
Bulky and heavy
Not neutral color balance"	0
This monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night. I test it frequently and it works. There has NEVER been a false alarm (everyone warned me I would lose my mind if it went off by accident, it hasn't). The only drawback, the channel is not so clear, there is static when you listen to it, but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny. (I have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when I just want to monitor noise during the day, but I would not have another monitor for his bedroom.	1
I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro. 	0
This monitor is by far the best baby item we have.  I love that I can sleep at night, and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing.  We have been using it for 4 months, and have had no false alarms.  You just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby!  I did not have this monitor with my first child, and I sure wish that I had.  It is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids, whether this is your first or your fifth baby.  Well worth the added expense.  Don't even mess around with other monitors, just get this one and get some sleep!  By far the BEST ITEM I own for my baby.  	1
For nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5X) magnification.  It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I sent this product back. 	0

This is the perfect mattress for my little princess. It's nice and cushy while providing the necessary firmness. The vinyl cover is easy to wipe off if there are accidents.

I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old.  She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved.  The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster.  I think the Dakota booster works great.  It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back.  This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster.  The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)	1

"At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.

Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens"	0
"It's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier.  This product solves that problem!  And it's cute too.  I was shopping at Babys 'R' Us recently and the sales girl asked where I got my ""super cute"" diaper bag/carrier.  I told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item (no word yet on whether or not they will).  I have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts.  It's the ultimate in convenience and fashion"	1
"This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.

I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    

In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon. "	0
"We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own.

It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children.

We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting"	1
This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it. 	0
"My son is 5 months old and LOVES this jumper!!!  He can keep himself entertained and I am able to do some things with both hands!  Plus, it's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down, laughing!

"I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.

Later, I decided on the Tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  The salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when I told him I had this Canon lens.  He said, ""let me guess, you'd like to try the Tamron 17-50/2.8.""  He said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. I could return it with no questions asked if I wasn't satisfied.  He also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  

My first images with this lens were great.  They were SHARP and had way more vibrant color.  There is absolutely no comparison at all.  I was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon.  I was so dissapointed that I wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  After spending $$$ on a digital SLR, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  Before taking a chance on buying the Canon, do yourself a BIG favor and try the Canon and Tamron at a local store.   "	0
this bag is great for a short trip. it has enough space for a few pampers, up to 2 bottles ...it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space. im a pro. with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me!	1
"I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to ""unwind,"" causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a ""Photo / Video"" tripod.  

Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.

Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.

If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.

That's why I give this one 2 stars"	0
I originally bought this bag for a trip to Disney World.  It held everything great, stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack.  Although I was not using it to carry children's gear, I carried an umbrella, 3 bottles of water, granola bars, sun glasses, cellphone, keys, wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great!  I am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag, it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far	1
Looks nice. Unfortunately did not power up the camera, so I can't say much else. Going to cost me return shipping at the very least. Sorry I didn't buy the Canon product instead	0
This is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks- I had more leaks with disposables.  We are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes.  I am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth, and delighted with the ease of use of this product.	1
They sent me wrong lens cover and said I ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since I got copy.......poor customer service all around.....	0
"it is a little costy but worth the money. it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways. since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness.a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight. 
 once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover. its size is large enough to last many years. "	1
"I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:

-I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!
-The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.

Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30."	0
"I'm a mother of a 21-month-old. I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks. This backpack is perfect. It fits me well and my daughter loves it. She asks to stay in it when we're done! I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I've tried before when she was younger. You do have to toughen up your shoulders (by taking shorter walks at first) before going on any long hikes, of course. I don't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews, because the chest strap is adjustable, long, and sits just below the shoulders, avoiding the ""busty"" area very well. However, it does come out of the box at the shortest setting, so you have to loosen it to fit your frame. The question of being able to ""close"" the frame with the child in it doesn't seem to be an issue on mine. The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back. You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you, though. It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk, but if you're in tight quarters, you'll want to close it. I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn's (my daughter's) feet behind me in the frame at first, which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame. The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist. (The picture on the box helped me figure that out.) It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months, and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield. The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath. It's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you, but I've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack (I'm reasonably fit, and she's just under 30 pounds). This thing is rugged, comfortable, good-looking, and has ""be prepared"" features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack (that can be carried on the frame, if you'd rather)"	1
Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US	0
I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well.  As I am large and this pack fits me, I would think this would ajust to a small person well.  I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back.  I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems.  The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed.  The pack is very comfortable for both of us.  The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack.  I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out, but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price.  I highly recommend this pack.	1
This kit is just junk. The &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges	0

"I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?

It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.
Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. 

This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.

Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.

Do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera"	0
Baby is happy, eating well.  What better praise for a bottle nipple can be given?  Note: Fast flow is for age six months and up, the slow/medium flow nipples by Avent are just as good (just for younger babies	1
"I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. My much cheaper, and lower resolution, old Minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. I find I have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. In addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.

Don't buy this camera"	0
my son was a very fussy bottle eater.  He would never finish his bottle until I switched to a faster flow nipple.  Now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater.  He became frustrated that the milk wasn't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect.  He is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed.  Now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding	1
This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	0

"Our grandson reciently came to live with us, nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty. 
The day  our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help.
 About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet.As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! He is now doing very well with his training !

"I purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a NASCAR Nextel Cup Championship in Homestead, FL. I was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning. The lens is not very sharp, feels very cheap, and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light. 

I packed up and returned the lens about an hour after I got off the plane. I am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture. 

I suggest you do the same."	0
"I received my original New Native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997. I wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies #2 and #3. Now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn (we have the purple one), so I thought it time to buy a second sling. The original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we'll still use it, but I'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years! :) 

Pros: This sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you. It's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily. Men don't mind wearing it (at least my husband didn't), it comes in basic solid colors and doesn't scream ""baby!"" when you're out and about. Many people couldn't tell I was wearing the baby when she was little. It's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse, once you figure that out. It's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler (I've even used it with two-year-olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn't an option). You can carry the baby on your front or back (with experience, this is doable, but mostly for older babies), on your hip (once your baby can sit strongly). It's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it. (No complicated latches, webbing or snaps to clean.)

Cons: If you get the wrong size, the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt. My original is the Large size (based on chest measurements from the manufacturer) but I'm going to order a Medium this time. My husband still likes the Large, but he has a longer torso than I. Newborns may need some support in the New Native sling, otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric. I always use a tightly rolled-up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first, then lay the baby's head and back on top of it. This pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don't feel like she's lost in there. Usually I only do this for the first few weeks. After a while, your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people.

The trickiest thing with the New Native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back, which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps. You have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it. If you can master this, the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all-day babywearing.

Highly recommended! Good value for your money."	1
"I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses:
Canon 10-22mm
Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version)
Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it. 

The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too. 

You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens."	0
"A friend recommened that I try her sling for my colicky baby. Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours. As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax. It was like magic and truly kept me sane.
After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us. Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously. When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller. She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile. I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it. Bought another new native and am thrilled. One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes."	1
The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself	0
"We have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights, as well as on many car trips at home and abroad.  It is great!  It is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars.  On some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom, but the cushioning is adequate, my son has never complained.  He seems very comfortable in it.  ""Baby Bargains"" recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby, and I am online ordering one for my daughter right now.  If you expect to travel, this seat is an essential.  It is light enough that lugging it around airports, cruiseships and such is not a total pain (although as with any seat, it is nice to have a bag, we've done it both with and without)"	1
"""You get what you pay for""

Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.

I was hoping the same of this product from all the ""glowing"" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.

Here are it's bad points:

-The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.

-The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.

-The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.

In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod"	0
"I don't know what one of the reviewies was talking about.. if you read the manual, you will learn that you need to move the ""leg"" on the front so that the seat sits Level.  That will keep your childs' head from falling forward.  If that fails, go to Burlington Coat Factory and get a wedge, to prop it up more.. (to most moms I know this has been common purchase)
I think that it is a very Nice and Well built car seat..  I do agree that it would be nice to have the Seat Belt tabs  so that you don't need the base.. but getting an extra base isn't a bad ideal, anyways..  
Remember you should always have your Local Police Department check your seats, before your child rides in it.. this is usualy a free service.. and is often held at a local Babies R U"	1
"Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was ""refurbished"" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for ""refurbished"" items is less than 6 months"	0
I have a independent child. SHe will not let you help her do anything so when we got the the potty training stage she had to sit on the potty like mommy. She refused to use those little potty chairs also she did not want to be lifted up and she was still to short to get up on her own by a step stool. When I found this product she was estatic. She started the day we got it and fully trained herself by the end of the week. I agree the product if a bit Flimsy and could use another go at it. All in all I do not think my daughter was in any danger using this product though. Before you buy it though make sure you have a round toilet and not an oblong or else yes it will slide around. The manufacture told me this over the phone when I called them about the issues I had read. They said it is not made for every family and I agree you have to try something to see if it will work. Unfortunatly ever child is different and has a mind of there own	1
"I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. 

-Positives-
fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.

The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.

that's about it.

-Negatives-
The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.

The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.

Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.

It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).


I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak"	0
"I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool"	1

"Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! 

With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.

WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!"	0
We love this seat.  It is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs.  Or at mother inlaws without a highchair.  Or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair.  When traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event.  There are so many uses for this great little seat.  It is extremely light weight and compact, and comes with a carrying bag	1
"I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to ""radio control"" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. 

If you need a ""cable release,"" I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time."	0
"I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below, and I was thoroughly satisfied.  My only complaint was actually with my luggage, as the handle on my bag was a little short so I had to stoop a little while I was pushing/pulling it.  Everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever, especially other moms traveling with kids.
The strap is so simple it's genious - just strap on the carseat and go!  It was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security, but everything is a hassle at security.  Just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it's fine.
This is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze.  Bravo!"	1
I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazo	0
We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to Mexico.  We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage.  He was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went.  We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry.  At $20, you can't beat the price.

"I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.  
The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign.
The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.

The filters that I got are poorly finished.  The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens.  All filters come off EASILY.  They are totally useless.  I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens	0
This is a great product. It takes a little practice to get the right amount of water. Disposables take much less b/c they tend to trap the steam, etc. I don't see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true. Sure it boils the water - it has to make steam! But why would you reach inside there? There is no reason I can think of why you'd ever need to do that. And with the first 2 children we used this on, I've never had a bottle even become remotely stuck, snug, you name it - not even close - so don't worry about it. I've used Avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as Playtex disposable bag bottles. It's not really a good use of money if you're just using formula - just make it with warm water. But if you're nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night, this is a must have...	1
This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	0
This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money	1
I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.

"Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price. 

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. 

Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings. 

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter. 

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, ""it is Canon, it must be quality."" Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.

"Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my ""picky mom seal of approval"" wholeheartedly. Here's why.

I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc.

The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself.

Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book"	1

We like this car seat for the price we paid. Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat.	1
"I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.  
I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you. "	0
I was very pleased when I saw just how beautiful this car seat was. Now that my daughter is 3 months old I feel I can give it a review. I read many things about complaints but I just don't have any. Everything works well on it. It doesn't fit well in all carts but carts weren't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it's not a bad thing about the car seat itself. All infant carriers will have the same problem. I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks. It's pretty and fits great in it's stroller. All in all, it's a great buy. Although my next time around, I'm passing up the infant carrier and going Britax. They're much safer imo from what I've read and heard	1
"The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products!

This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially. 

I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera."	0
This was a great carseat and carrier.  Easy to install with the level indicator.  A few drawbacks:  Once my daughter was a few months old, it got really heavy to carry around.  She also outgrew it by 6 months.  The harness needs to be longer.  It doesn't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably.  And for some reason, the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use.  My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood (because she couldn't move the handle up) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom (because she couldn't move the handle back).  My advice, before you buy, realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand	1
Don't buy this camera really.  I had it for a month and was taking good care of it.  I was initially thrilled.  The LCD screen got damaged -- no I didn't drop it.  The treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that I was shocked. The customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if I were an idiot.  A $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible.  It was a great camera at first, but I demand better treatment and respect from the company.  Look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera.  I had read very negative things about Sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true.  I don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when I am the customer.  The camera is a month old and it is now garbage.  While I understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, I will not accept such poor treatment and customer service.  I teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera. 	0
"Baby size: My daughter started out at just over 5 lbs, and this seat fit her well from the beginning.  The straps have adjusted easily as she's rapidly grown, I haven't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had.  The head support worked well too (at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head).  A baby's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat, but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily.  The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats (like my Toyota Camry) because of this angle requirement, but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue.  

Portability: I love the stay-in-car base, which I found easy to install properly.  It's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out, and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not.  An extra base is great for families with multiple cars, as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go.  The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car, but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs (and I'm fairly strong).  It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart, but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion; I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket.
  The Snap n' Go stroller is great if you're taking this seat farther from your car.  It's much more lightweight than the large ""travel system"" Graco also sells with this seat.  It's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push, but a little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft.

Durability: I can't comment on the seat's lifespan, as we've only been using it a little over 2 months.  A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn't happen often.  The canopy seems rather flimsy to me, but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller, so it hasn't been an issue so far.

Other considerations: Windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern, if this matters to you.  My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes, and people seem to assume she's a boy about 60% of the time when she's in this seat.  The carrier handle has several different positions: up for carrying, flat for carseat use, and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble.  With the handle left up, the ""wobble-enabled"" carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts.

I would buy this seat again.  Its only drawbacks are its weight (probably unavoidable since it's a carseat and must be sturdy) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling (but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem)"	1
The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it	0
My daughter received this as a gift from Mommy when she was about 3 1/2 months. At first, she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face, but if you take off a ring take it higher, your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy.  The only complaint I have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child.  The mirror distorts your child's vision, so I took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it! My daughter loves it, she could be eating her breakfast, or sitting in her swing and all she'll do is stare at her playmat! A definite must for all parents	1
Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for	0

"We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it. 
The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly. The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use. Our Graco does that too so I don't know if that is the norm with monitors. The sound is the best when pluged in. The nightlight is great. The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet. It say's it is 19% in every room and I don't know that is correct. The temp works fine. I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works. I like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time. I haven't used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful. 
Over all - like my choice in the monitor."	1
this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope)	0
We heat our home with a coal stove, so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold.  With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room.  The humidity level comes in handy during cold season, I've found.  The night light on this monitor is great, it's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether.  I've not owned it very long, so I can't comment on durability yet, but so far so good.  My [..] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it's still fine.  I would definitely recommend this monitor, thank God the price was right too	1
"I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame.

I shoot with a 20D.

"I've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I'm still nursing my little girl.  I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day.  At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast, suction isn't enough.  Then I got the Easy Expression Hands-free Bustier which has solved that problem.  I can now do e-mail, talk on conference calls, etc. while I'm pumping so I don't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk.  I'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler, with the ice pack so I don't think the cooler is too small.  Also, I don't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack.  If you don't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there's no problem with storage in the backpack.  I also reccomend the Medela Micro-Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work. Also, I don't think the suction is too hard...yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced, but it is by no means painful.  Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth!

"From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530.  Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to ""zoom in"" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on.   To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.

"Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:
 * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.
 * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.
 * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.
 * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.

The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula, so my pump has already paid for itself (used for 6 months and still going strong)! I've tried generic immitations and they just don't compare. Invest your money in the real thing, it's worth it	1
"PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS CAMERA'S SHOCK SENSITIVITY

I was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the SECOND time. It's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. The result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. It didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly.

The first time it happened Casio repaired it under warranty. The second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. I won't reinvest in a weak product. I'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether"	0
I am so greatfull to this pump! I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each, while working full time, taking vacations (without the kids), etc. I also have the car adapter which is awesome, I was able to pump to and from my work, (which is over an hour away), while driving. I only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros! The warranty is only good for a year, but mine is now three years old and still going strong. We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year, if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one! Best of luck	1

"I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.

The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the ""film"" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens.

They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro.

As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.

Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens?

The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.

After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots). 	0
I cannot say enough positive things about this item! I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night. This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids.	1
"I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. 

Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. 


Cons:

In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.

Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).

The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. 

Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.

The 420EX flash is supposed to ""talk"" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. 

After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.

Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.

So would I recommend this camera:
If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere"	0
I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton.  I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product.  They are wonderful.  If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small.        	1
Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all	0
My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital.  Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son	1
The camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently. I just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem	0
Like any parent, I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets.  Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex	1
I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.	0
my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.  I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face!  Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night.  This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	1
"When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!

Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon"	0
my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo.  this set is adorable and practical.  he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl.  th eonly thing to be ware of is-- it gets VERY hot in the microwave.  even if you just put it in for 20 seconds, it must cool dow	1
"I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.

Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting"	0
I don't know what the reviewers before me were talking about.  I use this at Kroger, Giant Eagle and Target and don't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store.  It's sturdy, and easy to use.  Don't pass this one up	1
DO NOT buy the case Canon sells for this camera. It takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	0
"Good things: (1) No interference. We live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs. (2) Connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement. I've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems. (3) You can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery.

Only one bad thing--the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless. They are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband"	1
They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2. 	0
"We struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco.  The first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless.  I can't explain how delighted my wife and I were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby.  It was better than Christmas morning when we were kids!!!

We have wireless internet, cell phones, cordless phones, basically if its electronic we got it.  Despite all the potential for interfence the Graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference.  A must buy for any parent"	1
"As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)

The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months"	0
the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful . . . animal images are unusually cute.  i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall. the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up	1
"I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the ""female"" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.

I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black ""spring"" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.

I use this cord with a Stroboframe ""portrait/landscape"" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.

When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.

I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  

Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords"	0
This item was very cute.  The different textures (just like the bedding set) are a lot of fun.  I hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them.  My only complaint is the ribbon loops they've sewn on to hang them.  Mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven.  You can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though	1
I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.	0
These wall hangings are lovely.  The different textures are very cool.  Maybe mine were different than everyone elses, but they came with little ribbon loops on the back, and i don't get why there's an issue hanging them.  They're very very cute, and look adorable in the room. 	1
Over 90% of pictures I took by this Canon are blurry. No way can you fix it. I really got fed up with it. Waist your money. Waist your time. More important, waist your precious moments!	0
I was given these wall hangings as a present.  I love them and they make the room look great.  We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them.  There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back, but that seemed too complicated to deal with.  Therefore, my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top.  My husband then used a finish nail in the wall, and used the safty pin to hang over the nail.  The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on. It was easy to do, and the wall hangings look great!  I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight, but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed. I hope this helps others with this problem.  I still wonder though, why on earth the company didn't foresee this problem in the first place	1
I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about	0
Love it, love it, love it! No more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty, lint covered binkies. It could be a little bigger, for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it's a great idea	1
"After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read ""e18"".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18"", and you'll see what I meant.

Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight"	0
"I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out. 

For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight.

The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller. 

As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff."	1

I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me	0

"Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to ""Memory Error"" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.

This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the ""memory error"" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.

When I had my daughter I had no clue where to begin with breast pads so I bought several different types.  A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite.  I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads.  I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands.  It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable.  I didn't have any chaffing like with most others.  Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive. 	1
The Powershot A520 On Switch stopped working right after I started using the camera	0
These are the best pads for the task...the ultra thin pads are great for during the day...they dont leak and are very breathable...the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking.  i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads.  the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar.  try every kind you get...samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best.	1
For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months.

I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake	0
Bought 2 different monitors; this one has great features such as the motion sensor, auto and scan settings. The night vision is weak but daytime looks great. Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback. I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom. None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear. It is the best one that I've found on the market	1
"This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.

After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this.

We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago.  For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.  The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well	1
I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital.  The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  The delay between pictures is incredibly long.  The lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems	0

My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter. It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful. I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition. On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor. When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling. On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable. Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality. I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer	1
OK, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the LCD screen as much.  The MOST annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  Both my 30D and Rebel XT.  If I am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually I will not be reminded I wasted money on this accesory	0

"I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.

Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless"	0
Our second one (for a second child).  We use one with a back; one without.  Easy-to-use, comfortable, solid.  A good choice for a booster seat at a good price	1
Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses. 	0
"We like this stroller.  It seems to be pretty durable, and its weight and portability (shoulder strap) make it ideal for trips, especially in airports.  My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall (6'4""), but it is fine for me (5'3"").  We like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline, but still sit up enough to watch what's going on.  He can hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet, so the various levels of the reclining back are nice.  Overall, a good stroller for the price"	1

We bought two of these to take on a family trip.  We chose these both for the price, and for the higher weight tolerance (45 lb).  Our 40 pound six-year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo.  They recline far enough for an infant, also.  But, our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights.  The strollers are compact and light.  The underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag.  There is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle, as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles.  The stroller was also easy to maneuver.  We are very pleased with our purchase!  The stoller can even hold a Combi carseat, but it didn't work with our Graco	1
The frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my PC.  My major complaint is the power supply.  The original power supply dies after 4 months.  It was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  The raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  I then had to buy one.  That one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  After months of waiting from them to stock the item I gave up and after lots of searching on the web I found a supply made by another compay.  I had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  It's been doing fine since then.  I should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  It looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  I would do a lot of shopping before buying this one	0
I absolutely LOVE these paci keepers and highly recommend them.  They are the only ones that my son doesn't manage to rip off of himself.  I got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear-facing car seat.  That made for a horrible trip.  I purchased these and they are awesome!	1

"I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size.

The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover."	1
"I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system (""we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you"") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit"	0

The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player.

This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged.

It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	0
The car seat itself is awesome, but the condition it arrived in was awful.  The box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind.  There was nothing covering the seat (like a plastic bag) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat.  It was a gift for my Grandson for Christmas so I didn't have time to return it and hope for a timely return.  It took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat.  Simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me. 	1

This stroller holds up to 55 lbs., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs. I love the raised handle bars. They cause less strain on your shoulders and back. There is a roomy basket under the seat, which is a great bonus. The 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass. Once my son was able to sit up on his own, I have used an umbrella stroller exclusively. This is hands down the best one I have ever had. It is also very modern looking in black and gray	1
I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls	0
The base seems to be high quality.  It is sturdy and easy to install.  It is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat.  Other than being pricey, there is no complaints	1

When we first got the stroller, it pulled to the left significantly, but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating. The stoller works great now.  I have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly	1

"I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one!

First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.

I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.

If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech"	1
"There's little more to say....great item, almost a ""must have"", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal"	0
"I am sure this is a good stroller (that's why I bought it!)

My ""review"" is more of a word of caution: this thing takes forever to arrive.  Don't be fooled: ""Usually ships within 24 hours"" really means ""May ship sometime"".  As of 2/8/06, our stroller has not arrived.  It was ordered January 1, 2006.  It is not even slated to ship for another week (we'll see...).  
Meanwhile, the local store has several in stock.
My advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion: go to your local store.  Otherwise, be prepared to wait a very long time. "	1
I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.	0
"This is the greatest product.  They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to, are lightweight, easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at.  Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says ""Elmo, Elmo, Elmo"".  They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple.  I wouldn't do without them, they are great"	1
"I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'

I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.

That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.

What else can I say about this camera:

This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.

It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.

I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.

When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?

I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.

There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star"	0
Table toppers are an awesome product. We don't leave the house without them. It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp.... there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper. We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing. The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food. Other people, not only parents, ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product	1
I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??	0
"I did A TON of research on convertible infant-toddler car seats before my son outgrew his Graco SnugRide at 4 months. Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings (this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats!) I chose this seat because it has EPS side-impact protection under the carseat cover. It's worth the extra money because it's your child's life! Also, it's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps, and the cover is really silky and comfortable. My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway.

My only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into the seat, but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports, not Britax. Also, the straps don't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son's neck. I just bought some soft terrycloth ones from Babies R Us for $4.99. It works"	1
I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again	0
"If you have an ipod or mp3 player, I'd recommend getting this.  I think the baby is going to love it!  I bought it last week, and tested it out (our baby hasn't been born yet).  The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby's crib or room IMO, and I'm 1/2 deaf.  I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color.  
My only criticism is that it takes batteries (no AC adapter).  We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly.  For $20, I think it's great"	1
"I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera.
After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate.
I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers."	0
"I was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this iCrib sound system. It has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer, so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the iCrib will shut down after the specified time. The nightlight is also really neat, as it cycles between four different colors. The only problem with this product is that it cannot run on AC, only on batteries, so we'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years, but otherwise this is a great product.
Edit--After further consideration I would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons. First, I have found the lack of an AC power source to be very inconvenient. Second, as the batteries wear down, the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly"	1
I paid extra for Air Next Day service.  Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  Item eventually arrived two weeks later.  I had left for a trip.

I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash	0
Just love it! I had the Jeep tandem and it was nice until my son got so big (40 lbs, 39 inches) you couldn't steer it very well. The BOB is amazing! I have a 3 yr & 1 yr old. You can't feel the weight difference. It rides so nicely. Both my children are very tall/heavy (dense) for their age and my eldest has plenty of room to grow - which was my biggest concern. My husband just loves the shocks - go figure. It compacts nicely....and if you need it even more compact the wheels come off in a snap and can be stored in the seat. It's amazing! I'm so glad I purchased it. REI has a great price on it ($400+/-...tried Ebay too but REI was best. Have fun in your stroller search and good luck	1
"When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. 
After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. 
The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!
They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera."	0
i got this for my baby due in march. even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy. its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather. it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby. it washes well too! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you don't need it then the top part zips off and you don't have to take baby out and remove the entire product. then the next chilly day zip the top back on! great all around	1

"When it comes to using this for your children you'd have to first know what your needs are. I can't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing; it would be more like a psychological barrier. But depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they shouldn't have.  
I ordered this to use for my puppy.  In my case I don't have the problem of her pushing on it so I can't say how long it would last through that.  For this price I was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install."	1
The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.	0

"This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.

The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.

I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon"	0

Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.

"Just received this set and my wife and I love it! The construction is very solid but not too bulky for us. The micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture. The only two complains are: 1) The handle's height is not adjustable, which seems a bit too high to us (I am 5'6"" BTW); and 2) it would be great to have a hand-break (i.e. wheel lock button on the handle) -- We previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not; it is the collapse/expand button instead. Despite these imperfection, we feel it much worth the $195 we paid for"	1
While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus.

It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!"	1
This camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work.  It's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures.  When you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible.  We trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing	0
"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn't at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won't go back.
It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full. 
But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy"	1
i had just recently bought this camera, and it was OK. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it, and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid CD that comes with it and now i cant install it. overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of JUNK. now im begging my parent to buy me a REALL DIGITAL CAMERA!!not a peice of crap.	0
this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	1

"After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller.  I am glad we didn't listen to those naysayers.  It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful.  The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish.  Yes, the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is.  We've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains (Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto) and it rides smoothly.  It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters (2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant).  I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor.  Also, we love the capabilities, spring shocks for a smooth ride, shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers.  We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk.

As for the weight.  Yes, it is heavier but come on, it is not ""10"" times heavier.  People exaggerate too much.  If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms, then the stroller is nothing.  People are too much of a wimp.  It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much.  They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy.  Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life (my two daughters) are protected. 

The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying.  Just use Silicone spray and they all went away.  We've been through rain, dirt, and hot sun with this stroller and we've been so happy with it.  I highly recommend purchasing it.  but make sure you have a truck, mini-van, or SUV.  I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller.  But I figured if you have two toddler/enfants, you may consider getting a bigger car"	1
We bought three of these for Christmas presents and two of them stopped working already.  They won't turn on at all.  One of them broke almost immediately, and Philips sent a refurbished unit to replace it.  That one is now broken, too.  The units have not been dropped or mistreated in any way. 	0
"Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.  

Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.

Would highly recommend"	1

"Tip!!! You can push a 4 oz. baby ""Juice Bottle"" that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery, up into the Playtex Nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners.  This will prevent punctures from your fingernails. Be sure to remove the ""Juice Bottle"" before feeding baby"	1
This one is a product of bad quality, the cap of the batteries to a few days I damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear, product of bad quality I do not recommend it to him(you,them) and for quality the price must be low	0

"Well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. The video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. Also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. The adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. The sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to ""freeze up"".

Bottom line...I recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. Its trash. Go for something else"	0
I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child. I wish I would have used this system for all my children. I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone	1
Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!	0
I can't find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter, but this tub looks most like it.  I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub, but that didn't work at all.  The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go.  My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all.  It is a pain to blow the tub up, but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook, so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall.  My daughter is nearly 1 year old now, and has been using this tub for about 5 months.  There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she'll be using this tub for awhile.  I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub	1
I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP	0
"We have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old, and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room.  We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across.  

It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours.  If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult.  Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability.

As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it.  The extra foot adds stability.  The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds.  We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs.

As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things.  We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company.

I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong.  I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace"	1
I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.	0
"I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22"" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone"	1

"This is an excellent product.  It is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about SIDS.  I felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib... and that she wouldn't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats.  
I was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton... and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material.  We even had family members that thought that someone had made the CribShield for us. "	1
"I only wish I had read the previous review before I bought this item.  I too was trying to convert my Hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my Sony MiniDV handycam.  I bought this way-too-expensive cable, mostly because it was the only option available.  It seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card, considering the technology involved in those devices.

But my real problem is with the failure of Sony to reveal that the S-video connection is useless for input.  This information is nowhere on the package, nor is it on their website.  There IS a notice saying ""please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase"".  You can't read that warning when buying online, and if buying at a store, there's no way to know what's compatible because they don't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package. I guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website, then come back to the store and buy it, instead of just buying it and seeing if it works.

There is a section of the Handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one, however they fail to mention that the SONY cable won't work, despite the premium price they charge.  If the problem is that they couldn't make it work with both a composite and S-video cable, then they should have just made it work for S-video, since a composite cable comes with the camera.

Shame on you, Sony, for adding a little aggravation to my day, and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard.  It's enough to make me want to buy a Canon camcorder (I buy Canon digital cameras precisely because I don't want to submit to proprietary Sony standards like MemoryStick).

"I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was ""stuck"".  They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh ""bumpers"" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor"	1
"Conclusions:

To start from the end I got the Xacti CA6, tested it and returned it. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros - 
1. Very small, just put in your pocket and go
2. Easy and simple controls
3. Super fast start up from sleep mode
4. Good video quality when lighting conditions are good
5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (I had no issue with the video pausing, no way around that)
6. You get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price
7. SD card that records for a long time
8. Easy transfer to computer for editing 

Cons - 

1. Indoor video unacceptable, although the video is brighter the ones my Sony digicam takes, it is extremely grainy (more so than my Sony digicam videos!!)
2. Super slow zoom when in video mode
3. In good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move, for scenery it might be OK)
4. In low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very, very weak flash.
5. Red eye almost every time the flash works
6. Strap is a joke
7. No lens cover

So in short, on paper this camera is great, I love having the SD format rather than tape or DVD, the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless. 
But....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical).
This camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). For almost everyone else it is not adequate, I will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a miniDV camcorder  (going for the Elura 100).....
Ya, I know people told me that this was the best option beforehand, I was hoping to prove them wrong....; - ("	0
"Overall, we are very happy with this product. I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn't come up only partway like a traditional bumper. Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it ""gives"" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen."	1
"In an email, Adorama specified that the filter diameter was, ""28mm."" On the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting! Either they don't know their products or they don't care about the customers. Now I have to return it because of faulty information they supplied. Please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25% of the purchase price - an amount I feel is beyond absurd. I can buy this locally for a lot less (even though I would have to pay sales tax). Buyer beware"	0

My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.  I am done with this camera	0
We used the small size until our daughter was too long for it (around 3 months old) and switched to the large size.  She still loves it and is sleeping great (3 day naps and 10-11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night)!  It is part of her naptime/bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are.  The velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated. 	1

It worked fine the first week. Then the focus stopped working. I sent it to repair. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working. I sent it for repair for the second time. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working. Also, it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at SONY!!! They make you wait over an hour!!!
Si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for!!!

My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age.  I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn't believe how huge it looked!  We didn't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big.  We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long.  At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it.  I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future.  I think he'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he's 6 months old and this blanket should work	1
"After a few months use the camera got persnickety, often demanding upon startup that I restart it. Now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, I think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. Another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. Not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.

The lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. Several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. Otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.

The camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., Canon A610. Many frames are motion-blurred, as well. There are ways to avoid this, but I didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.

There are a few things to recommend it: Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. Those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. It is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) The jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. Skintones are good.

Still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. Lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, I did keep the receipt. Anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo"	0
The Medela breast pump works with Dr. Brown's bottles (you can pump directly into the bottle)!  Just an added benefit to an already great product.  I've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems.  It's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months	1

"I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby.  This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006.

Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:-

1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.  

2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise.

3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry.

4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply.

5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).  

Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops.

This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it!"	1
I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it	0
"To bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed, these leg extensions are the best bet.  Yes, as someone else said, they do make it a little shaky.  
So if you are not planning to attach the co-sleeper to your bed, you may want to leave the height alone.  (You'll be getting up anyway, so it probably doesn't matter how tall it is.)  But once attached to the bed with the anchor strap, rather than free-standing, it was very secure. "	1
"I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities. 

In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after ""erasing"" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera. 

I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons. Good luck Fujifulm...you need it"	0
"We've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size ""big boy bed"".  We're quite satisfied with it.  

Construction:  Very sturdy, our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way.  The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep.  We tug on it from time to time and it's not going anywhere.

Assembly:  Not too easy, the instructions are horrible, but once you realize on your own how it's supposed to go, the actual assembly is OK, but not quick.  Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature.  

Hide away feature:  This is what took away the 5th star.  It's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed. That feature works but requires some wrangling.  If you want the hide away feature for once in a while, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, if you plan to hide the rail daily, I don't recommend it for that.

Making the bed:  Easy to tuck the sheets around it, no need to hide away or struggle.

Overall, I would highly recommend this bed rail, I read all the reviews, and asked many friends, and this seemed to be the best in all areas, and a good value for the price, considering other can be well over $xx"	1
I was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once I did.  The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) likes like a massive blur.  And the video skips all the time.  It just misses entire parts.  I would highly recommend NOT getting this camera.	0
I love this car seat stroller.  It goes from car to airplane in no time flat.  Great if you travel with small children with just one adult.  Also great if running errands and your child falls asleep, no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car.  However, the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it.  I still love this product.	1

"B.O.B. Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him. 

Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go.

One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car.

Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!"	1
"I just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  But today I tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).  Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.  

Grrrrr!!"	0
I love it!  This is probably one of my most used baby items.  It is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean.  I've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends	1
I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.	0
This product was very easy to use, quick clean up, and very discrete to carry in public.  My husband and I are constantly using it when we are out with our child.  I especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage	1
"I purchased this item two weeks ago.  My thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced, perfect addition to the ""tools"" necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents, construction, and ""glow-in-the-dark"" planisphere).  After closely examining the item for the past ten days, I'm forced to conclude that I was in error, and that you really do get what you pay for.  As Celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy, I must confess that I assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name.  I have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps.  The major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings, letter transpositions, apparent omitted words, and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) ""typographical errors.""  Additionally, when I compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e., star magnitudes, astronomical distances, etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources I have in my possession, I also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances.  When using a product like this, it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains.  Since I'm not able to do this, I must rate this item with one star.  When I purchased the item, it was marked down by twenty percent.  I note that in less that two weeks since my purchase, the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent.  In this case, don't be fooled (as I was) by an attractive price.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT. (I don't have a substitute to recommend at this time.)     "	0
I use it while my daughter is lying down.  She loves being in the tub.  This just makes her float.  It's great as the get bigger to use like the ring.  Would buy for a friend and totally recommend!	1
After a week the cammera did not work. The shop has a return police, but they did not send a RA number needed to return the item. They asked me an adress in the USA, and whwn I sent it they did nor answered. In my country, Argentina, the local distributor said the garantee is not valid for them	0
"I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking. It is perfect for my girl. I do understand why people with boys may have issues, but if you have a girl it is just wonderful. I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better. It has a great weight to it so it's not flimsy, and it fits my girls bum so nicely, and the cushion is very firm yet soft. The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool, sit and pull herself back.
My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice, I saved $15 on something that works just as well"	1
"With this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully!  In standard mode, the playback of video is anything but smooth.  Looks like an old time movie.  

The software could best be described as, ""User Hostile"".  I haven't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete.

The normal video isn't as good as my DV camcorders and downright sad indoors.  The photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone (a pocket pc).  Still pictures haven't downloaded successfully either (approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer).

It's a handy size and easy to operate.  After you're done recording you'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual (I have) and then you start getting frustrated.

I have a home daycare, so this chair is used constantly. I've had two of these for well over a year, and today I bought a third one. I've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far. Nothing beats the swinging tray. I would recommend it to anyone	1
"I am fascinated with this machine.   It has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows.

The battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when I go touring.   If I take care to shut the display down as soon as I dont need it anymore I find that when I am on a cruise ship or visiting another country I can take all the movies I usually want - - and recharge when I get back to my room at night. 

The only problem is playback on a TV or PC.   The bundled software made by ULEAD is not user friendly and, whereas the previous Xacti I had played back images and video clips in the order I had taken, this one separates  them and plays back either clips or images.   Before I played back through my Panasonic Hard Disk DVD recorder and recorded a DVD directly.   Now I have to go into my PC and do a whole lot of editing and so far the ""Movie FActory"" program keeps crashing.

I imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program, or I will learn to use Ulead, but for the time being the pictures and clips Ihave taken have very good detail, and the machine has operated flawlessly."	0
We've used this seat when traveling, and everyday use at home.  When our son was about 15 months old, I put the highchair away and started using this.  It can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser!!  It folds down so it can be put away easily if you're having guests, unlike a big highchair!  GREAT CHAIR!	1
"Great features, right?
I just returned it after very disappointing results.
Here are just a few issues:
1. If you use a tripod (and you WILL need to), you can't plug in the AC adapter to save on the short battery life, because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the AC connection.
2. Battery life is very short.
3. If you want to protect the lens, you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens.
4. You can't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter BECAUSE the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures.
5. The automatic settings are horrible. The auto focus, auto white balance, auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors.
6. You cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording.
7. Quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light.

Save your money. Buy a camera with better features. I am waiting for the Panasonic HDC-SD1 due in March"	0
"We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.  

The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly!

We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!  

We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all.

Anyway, I highly recommend it.."	1
Should have listened to the reviewer before me.  Unit arrived dead.  Neither AC power or car charger worked.  Tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work	0
This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl (yes that includes swings and bouncy seats). I stumbled across it when they had just come out. She was sitting in it at 4 months. BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it. However... I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding. I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child. It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster (which is a double edged sward! Tough fro parents good for kids).	1
"I have been working with this camera for about a year now, for product shots online, and while sometimes it takes great pics, many times the flash pops and whites out, or it goes off and you get a black picture. I take pictures of jewelry, and if I try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration, the color is not accurate. Purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up. While you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings, in all different modes, you'll never get the same picture twice, even saving the setting. The light has to be just so, to get a good shot. When it shoots clearly, it can take fabulous pictures, but often, pics are blurred as many others have said, when they actually come out. My old camera, the DSC P71 3.2 Megapixel is MUCH better, colors are accurate always, shooting is flawless and foolproof every time, AND the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading. This feature is completely MISSING from the DSC P200, which was the biggest disappointment, as I figured it would be a given I didn't have to ask about when purchasing. Why would Sony eliminate this great function? Had I know that when the salesman at the large New York City Photo store told me this was the camera I dreamed of, I would not have bought it. I prefer also to use the rechargable AA batteries instead of the Lithium battery, which is super hard to load, and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with. It is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle. Every time it takes me several minutes, and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem. 
I recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to DVD. Sound quality is good, but video quality can be choppy, and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed, so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings I made. The monitor, while big, does not show you always what you are shooting, whether a still, or movie picture. Overall, I would not recommend this camera and I actually bought a USED second of my old camera, and got my original repaired, because this one doesn't compare. This camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly. Even after using all this time, I STILL am not sure what I am going to get when I use this camera. I'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color, this camera clearly has trouble showing blue/green shades, and purples accurately, you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera, and the lack of the ""trimming"" resizing feature, what was Sony thinking? Next time, I am trying something other than Sony Cybershot unless I hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward, uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera. This one is definitely NOT"	0
"VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS. 
You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! 

I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below: 

Pros: 
-You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! 
-Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me. 
-Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. 
-Lightweight and compact system. 

Cons: 
-The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock. 
-With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. 
-Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground. 
-A bit expensive.

A little of both... Pros/Cons: 

-Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. 
-Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. 

*Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*"	1
"I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because... I may have used the wrong settings when taking photo's. 
But... I ended up with ""a lot"" of blurred and fuzzy photo's. ""example... when we went bowling, almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks.""
My Biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use.
You might expect that out of a $30 Dollar Camera but ""NOT"" a $3 Hundred Dollar one.
I paid $284.99 for the camera, $47.99 for the 1 GB SD Memory Card and $51.54 for the Docking Station and that didn't include S&H or Taxes, they were extra $$$!
My husband replaced this one for me with the Kodak EasyShare C743 and G600 printer dock and it's a 7.1 MP and it takes better quality pictures that I can print @ home for less then this one. ($249.95 W/FREE Shipping & Handling and 1 GB SD Memory Card included) from K O D A K online"	0
Good baby monitor overall.  Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from	1
This Canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out, on a 1080p monitor.  I have used other HDV format cameras, and they were much better. The low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain.  If you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light, but still plauged in low light	0
We really like our Graco digital iMonitor. It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes, and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously. We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box--usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block, depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries. The lights that light up for baby's sound are quite bright, which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake	1

My husband is a NYC doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son's room in this theme. Since my hubby deals with taxi's and limo's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it. We also love Manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in L.I. The set is very well made and I like the fact that since it feels like it will last, my son can grown with it. It is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years	1
I bought this camera in Oct 2005. I brought it everywhere. Loved it. In April 2006, the LCD screen blew. Canon replaced it with a refurbished camera. In March 2007, the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00, as they have determined this is the result of impact damage. How they determine this is unclear to me, as it was not dropped or impacted...Apparently, you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera. That, to me, is the hallmark of a faulty product. Unfortunate - as I really loved this camera	0
If you are going to get a manual pump, get this one. I got a Medela from the hospital and it was SOOO slow and killed my hand, but this one is way better. It takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela, and it doesn't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals, and because you use it for less time total. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare it to one of those, but as far as manuals go this one is AWESOME	1
"I bought the sd300 to take with me touring by motorcycle. It is so small, I can just put it in a belt case and always have it. With the appropriate sd card I can take a huge number of pictures at a high quality setting. The pictures turn out great, BUT. Eight months after I bought it, the LCD screen suddenly went all crazed when turned on, tho there was no visible damage. I returned it for repair, no problem, no expense, had it back in two weeks. less than 3 months later, same thing. I know I did not drop or bump it, it went down in the 10 minutes between showing some pictures to one person, then to another, indoors. I called, was told it was still 
under warranty from the previous repair, and got a return label. Then I got an e-mail saying that I would have to pay $97 for repairs to the lcd screen caused by impact damage. I replied to the e-mail to protest, and was ignored. I finaly called, and was told that tho the warranty was still in force, this damage was not covered. Checking aroun the web, I found that this is a common problem, not damage. Unfortunately, I had already authorized the repair when I found this out, so I guess I am stuck. I have several canon products, will not buy any more"	0
"I have had great success with this manual pump.  

My best advice if you are having trouble is to TAKE OUT THE PETALS!!!  

This helped me immensely.  Milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my I was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening.  I took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective.

I used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me.  I highly recommend this pump"	1
I had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke, I don't know why it broke. I set it down and when I turned it back on, it had cracked. I then bought another LCD screen and repaired it myself, but two weeks later, I had a CASE for it, and put it in my purse. I carried my purse around and had not set my purse down. When I took it out, it had cracked again. I would not recommend getting this camera	0
Great product - I heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get; I agree	1
"HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this ""Deal"" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!"	0
"So far our 7 month old son likes this toy.  He watches the flashing lights, listens to the music and noises, and seems to like the different shaped blocks (we have several other peek-a-boo blocks).  He uses the handle to push the bus, flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on.  It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time.

We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn't flash.  Well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing.  It also made the hood stay shut better.  So maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem"	1
"I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.

This is a durable and quality product. My son uses it for everything, from turning the lights on to getting on the potty. I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old. I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable, classic in design and color. This is a sturdy non-slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs (give or take 10 lbs!) We used it so much that I bought another step stool, made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn	1
"so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like ""um... is THAT it???"" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... 

also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all... 

other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there."	0
Having only used it once, as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat, it worked WONDERFUL. Having a CLEAN place to put her food on was nice, as you never know just how clean the tables really are	1
Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it	0
I love that it sticks and doesn't slide. It is great for my 21 month old to feel part of the family when we eat	1
"I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said ""THANK YOU!"" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.  

The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious.

The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon.

The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one.

Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera"	0
This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can't believe we didn't buy it sooner.  It's easy to clean and doesn't slide off the chair.  Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy.  It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips.  Great vendor with quick delivery too	1
I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera	0
I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about--the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat.  It's easy to install and works great	1
Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside.  The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever	0
My daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and I was always worried that she would get cold, especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter. I saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl! She wears it every night now and I know she stays warm throughout the night. The only suggestion I have for anyone thinking of buying this, is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one. Mine is growing so fast that I will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long	1
I bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable.  The problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. During this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it.  Because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use.  I own Nikon 35mm SLR cameras and I am shocked that Nikon would sell this unusable product.  If it is your life your recording, I recommend that you buy a different camera	0
I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed.  However, when added the sleeper didn't seem as steady or stable on the floor.  There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them.  While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed, I expected something a little more solid or sturdy. 	1
"Unless you take picture outside, no matter what you do, the picture comes out blurry.
Flash doesn't help at all- it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture, and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors. 
My sister had a camera from Olympus, with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too, but I found it so much easier to take a picture(and a better one too) with that one. 
Unless you want to buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera, you shouldn't consider nikon 5600."	0
I used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place. It works GREAT! Her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better... which is a plus	1
I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera.	0
Our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home. When we tried to transition him to the crib, he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly. As he outgrew the stroller, we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib (lots of attempts - not an easy task!!). He's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the Sleep Nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized SwaddleMe at night. He loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly. The Sleep Nest is small enough to be cozy, but large enough for him to move comfortably. It fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go	1
"I made sure I did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.

I was highly disappointed when I got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately  the lens got stuck in the ""out"" position with an error reading that said:  lens error, restart camera.  I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing.  I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.  

I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.  Please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later"	0

Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know.

Video is okay for my need...still is too bad. 
Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons.

Battery did not perform as promised in the spec. 

Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit."	0
I haven't traveled with the bag yet, but the quality seems good. The bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal. My stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized. The stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag (the top thin long end is where the zipper is). They are removable wheels, so its no problem. With all the wheels on, the bag can't zip closed. That is why I gave it only 4 stars. I bought the bag because I will be traveling overseas soon and I don't want my stroller damaged during the long flight.	1
"I have to say I am very disappointed with this camera.  I had really high hopes for this one.  I waited for the hd2 to come out and when I saw a lot of positive reviews I bought one, I should have waited.  For Sanyo to call this an HD camera doesn't make sense.  The picture has more grain and noise then my old High 8 camera.  Outdoors in bright light the camera is ok. Low-light is horrible 

Pros:
- Nice form factor, love the look and feel and it's so tiny it fits in your pocket.  Very portable and something you can take anywhere. 
- Secure Digital cards are great, can transfer and edit on the computer quickly
- Still pictures are pretty good.  Although still digital cameras are better.
- HDMI output can plug directly into your HDTV (although if you are used to watching things in HD you will be disappointed)

Cons:
- Indoor and Low light situations very grainy, even with the high sensitivity button.
- Don't attempt to take still shots while you are filming, it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues.  Very cheesy.
- You can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying.  I thought SD was supposed to minimize noise.  
- Watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy, not even fast movement either.
- Image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras I have used.
- Audio sounds a bit tinny 

In my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you.  If you aren't too concerned with quality picture it's probably fine. I really think Sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device.  For now it should come with a warning of it's limitations.  I am not saying it's total garbage, but if you have high hopes like I did, you will be disappointed."	0
We got this for our cruise and it worked great.  It was very easy to carry and load onto the train, bus, and car when it was needed.  The material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty	1
"As I watch the videos of my kids on my 50"" plasma, 32"" LCD and Mac, trying to convince myself that I like the quality, my wife walks by and says, ""Fuzzy."" I know most guys out there will know what I'm talking about - she just killed the deal. Regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. It's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old Sony DVR. The product design is cool, the price is good, the SD card recording idea is perfect, but the HD promise doesn't come close to paying off.

If you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle."	0
This is such a great idea.  I just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib, we can make our own.	1
"I got mine today, and it is being returned today.  I had high hopes, given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity.  I was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video.  Here's my results:

1) Stills.  Pictures are not too bad, but do not compare with a similar 7MP Canon SD500 which I own.  The zoom works well, focusing is ok, but slow.  The pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them, flash or not, like they are all taken at a high ISO setting on a regular digital cam.  So slight disappointment here.

2) Video.  If this is improved low light sensitivity, I would not have liked to see the results on the HD1!  Video does not even come close to comparing to my regular Sony DV camera.  Focusing is hit or miss, and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my Sony.

I really was hoping for the be all end all combo device, but the HD2 does neither very well.  Ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well.  The finish is great and the buttons are well placed.  But it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves"	0
We are in Italy with these huge, weird shaped stairways. These gates are great and just what we were looking for. Easy to install, easy to use once up. They look nice in our house	1
If you got here looking for a bag for an XACTI camera, keep looking. This bag is too small. It can be used for holding memoery cards and batteries, but not much more.	0
"We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging. 

I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover"	1
"Ok, I was hasty in this purchase.  At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered.  You see, the dimensions listed under ""more details"" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  Turns out, not only do you have to click ""more details,"" (fine print) you also have to click ""more technical details."" (finer print)  Wish I had now.  Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2.  So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed"	0
"I can't tell you how much I love this product!!!  I live in Colorado and we've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now I can't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit.  It's so easy to slip her right it, zip it up and go!  I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down--this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy.  
I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked, but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better.
First, it washes beautifully!  The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it--unlike sherpa fleece.  Second, the outside fabric is waterproof.  Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off!  It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain"	1
I purchased this along with a Sony DCRHC21.  This Carry case was listed as an accesory so I expected it to be appropriately sized (as other Sony cases I've purchased fit like a glove).  This  case is entirely too large to hold a miniDV camcorder.  The camcorder rattles around inside it.  If you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  Otherwise I suggest you look at the Product Specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size. 	0
"I also own the Bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner & we could not have lived without it! I was excited to see this trendy,light-weight, weather resistant version for spring. I'll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $39.99. My $59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional!  No more struggling with bulky snowsuits, jackets and sweaters (which never seem to fit baby anyway)  Easily unzips so as not to overheat.  LOVE the little pocket for binky.  Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller (No need to buy two!)   
 "	1
"The look and feel of this camcorder is very good. Unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. For example, evening party, indoor school activities, kid drama and orchestra. This camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. Earlier I had a Sony DCR TRV140, which was way better than this camcorder.

This camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. One easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. Most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. These large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light.

If you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light, I do not recommend it."	0
I love this item.  It really works well in February winter weather.  I bought 4 snowsuits and I haven't used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious.  I am able to put her in her car seat, put a blanket inside and put a hat on her.  Forget the suits and mittens.  I cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly.  Also, it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they can't see her when I cover her up.  The only problem is that this item didn't fit well with the newest Peg Perego infant car seats.  I made it work, but it doesn't fit perfectly.  It worked with the old Peg Perego car seat, but not the newest one.  I loved this item so much that I've made it work, though.  It isn't perfect, but it works.  It actually is so much better than Peg Perego's cover, which came with the car seat.  This cover has made my life pretty easy.  I found it easy to put on the Peg Perego.  I love the color.  It zips up easily.  It is soft.  Isabella seems to like to snuggle in it.  It is comfy for her.  Be aware, though, I live in Salt Lake City, UT.  Our winters are mild. If you have colder winters, you may want to add a snowsuit.  Still, it is worth the money!  I am glad I bought it.	1
"After a week of using this I find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing.  Mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect, so maybe the motor was already fixed :-)  My mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender.  The ZR 500 is OK in low light, but you CAN adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. You can also adjust the focus too!

My friend who is a mini DV guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par.  

I've made two practice DVD's (with firewire, no problem at all) with this camera and like what I see.  

For those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out.  Power Director has that feature.

I am happy with this product, but I would rather have a higher end model now that I have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder.
A great camcorder for beginners! "	0

"Well, I'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product, but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on.  He's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed, but orthopedic giant dog beds STARTED at over $200.  We got the idea to try a baby crib mattress, and ordered it.  Very soon thereafter I arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable.  He loves it.  

It is well crafted and everything the ad said.  Our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog"	1
I have owned the S410 camera for almost two years, when on New Years Eve I pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the E18 error message appeared! It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! Beware of this flaw that Canon doesn't seem to acknowledge	0
"We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.  

We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.  

Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal. "	1
"Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.  

However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon."	0

"When I got this camera for my birthday April 2005 I thought that it was a dream come true. The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did. 
The camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. It is not worth the price of repair. Tomorrow I am going to buy a new camera."	0
"This diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use.

Not impressed at all with this product.  You are better off just to plug in your camera in the USB port and let Windows process it.

"Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.

Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month."	0
"I own this seat for my son who is age 6. It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8. The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable. The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck. The price is decent too.

The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders. If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car, the cupholders aren't very usable. Additionally, the cupholders don't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat. Personally, I leave the cupholders pushed in. I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat. 

I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such. Furthermore, with booster seats in general, I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat. My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium.

I would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child. Not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side.

As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt, this is a nice option."	1
"The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too"	0
As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome.  This chair is wonderful.  It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean.  I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean.  The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher.  Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all.  I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends	1

"When I was buying my husbands Olympus Camera this Rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so I ordered it.  Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time.  No it was not!!!  So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!!

"I purchased your ""Space Saver Highchair"" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult.  This chair works for everything!  This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day.  She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness.  The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely.  My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time"	1

"I received this stroller about a week ago, and so far, we love it.  The ride is smooth, it's very light, and I love the salmon color.  The shade comes in handy, too.

"i bought this toy a year ago and tried it on my ETX-90EC telescope all i got  is hazy moon video,the resolution is poor 
the maximum pixels is 640*420 which is very pooooooor resolution it didnt reach even 1 mega pixels , hey we've got now 12 MegaPixels chips why dont provide it celstron ???
tried to edit it with the included poor software but it was useless
i thought it might need bigger telescope so the aperture would be higher and  i might able to see some stars or galaxies as per advertisement
i went to my cousin who has LX90 8"" telescope, the result was bright dots seem to be stars
i dont recommend this toy its a waste of money

I was looking for a decent sized, sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect.  I have not used them to travel with but I do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting.  They do work great for her leftovers though when I put them in the fridge.  They are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas. 	1
"My title says it all - I was really disappointed with this camera, but before I get into the specifics as to why, I must mention a few things first.  This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, ""it's okay, it happens"", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called ""grey market"" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the ""grey market"" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the ""authorized"" product, and the ""grey market"" one.  For example, a ""grey"" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an ""Auction"" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short ""how to"" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with ""grey market"" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to ""explore"" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit ""warm"".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of ""pink"" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a ""broken"" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with ""stair stepping"" - the movies were ""jerky"", and ""noisy"".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly ""fixed"" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just ""cripple"" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather ""improved"" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it.

I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun.

However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  Good luck"	0

I can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was DOA.  Customer Service was unable to do anything over the phone.

I had my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes with just some toggle-like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through.

"I was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. I was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. The resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (IIIx), just enlarged.

I sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. I believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better"	0
I actually had put this on my daughter's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn't wait to see if she'd get it for her 1st birthday.  I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too.  My daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point.  She's only 9-1/2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she'll enjoy it more.  My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof.  Other than that, a fun toy.  After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it. 	1
they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill. The batteries charged lasted atleast five hours, so no complaints there, but the charger would keep coming out from the wall. It only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it wouldn't stay all the way in, I tried several outlets, finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all	0
This is one interesting toy!  I love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water!  You can even create music for it, which is something I've never thought would be possible.  Kids today have it made! 	1
"I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's ""memory effect"" or ""voltage depression,"" my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.

I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't.  The reason is because it was dead on arrival.  I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.  Steer clear of this piece of junk	0

I can tell from her cry through the monitor whether I need to prep or bottle, get a diaper ready, or its time for play.	1
"My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.

I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see"	0
Every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor. Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not. The receiver side is battery operated, so even if I walk around the house I can here my baby. Even the smallest sound is picked up! Amazing. I haven't tried other monitors, but this one is perfect and inexpensive, so I would recommend it to anyone	1

It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat.  I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle.  I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out.  We just put on her hat and go.  The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort.  It helps too that it is rain resistant.  I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out	1
"I have been searching reviews of the Nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and I am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with Nikon only to be told 'sorry'.

In a nutshell, I am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new SLR models.  I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES. 

The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is.  Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures"	0
Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.

No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.

It took no time to figure out how to use this seat.  My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car.  The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding.  I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry.  My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water.  They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat.  Highly recommended.	1
"The camera feels slick.  The software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency, though the intuitiveness is not its strength.  While the large LCD display is terrific (the main reason I got it), It is worthless in a high glare situation.  You can't see what you are shooting.  It's worthless!  And since Nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations, there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting.
While the viewing wheel, to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken, is quite handy, the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive, and often takes so long to figure out that you give up.  Pictures are generally good, though the conditions have to be perfect, or you get grain or blur.

There is one lovely feature, but it is only useful on a tri-pod.  It is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background.  It creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix.  I use that feature a lot, but its worthless without ""legs"" for the camera.

I bought this on a whim, counting on the Nikon reputation.  Had I known, I would have stuck with the Canon"	0

"I really don't know how to write a ""helpful"" review for this camera, I'm not a photographer; all I can say is that I was NOT satisfied with my purchase, so...

***
If you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like I was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras.
***

Here are my complaints:

Flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.

Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.

The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.
Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).

The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.

Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!

Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier. The video mode is great as well.

If you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then I must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time"	0
Even though this costs a bit more, its worth every penny! It is so easy to put in the buggy! My son is comfy and fits in it very well!	1
I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.  This camera is going back to amazon in the morning	0
"In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.

It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.

Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.

Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!

On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the ""Shop'n'Dine"") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.

Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health."	1
VERY slow storage even with a fast card....small but too thick for comfortable handling. I ended up selling it on ebay and buying a Canon SD600 which is a great camera, thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket, fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time. I've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures. Don't buy the Nikon without first checking out the Canon SD600.	0
"We've had this toy for around 3 years now.  My second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn!  It is also a hit with other children visiting our house.  The toy is as educational as it is fun!  We've used it to practice colors, shapes, and musical creativity.  It can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~$20 new.  All in all a FANTASTIC toy well worth the price!  Another upside is how friendly and helpful the Neurosmith company is.  We lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement.

My friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much"	1
"I agree with the people complaining about the poor CS policy at JVC. They let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. 
I am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid JVC in the future. I just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. This will come back and bite them in the behind"	0
This 2-in-1 is amazing.  The scent is wonderful...too bad they don't make it for adults :)  A very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike.  It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully.  I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn't Mustela.  Fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products.  Try them and you'll see why	1
This camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  When we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - Nebraska).  This worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  I wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable	0
great sleepsack for our little bundle.  keeps her warm & toasty.  i love the microfibre interior because it's warm, but not too hot.  also the exterior is wind resistant, so it's perfect for san francisco.	1
"I agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" defect on their JVC GR-xxxx. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs."	0
This is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids. This is a pretty boring product, but everything worked just fine.	1
It is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off.  It is not the stuff that I expected froma brand name like Panasonic	0
"We have these straps all over our house (on every piece of furniture taller than two feet), because we have two ""climbers."" There have been two occasions that I know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury, as she climbed large pieces of furniture. 

The hardest part of installing these is finding them. We searched several local stores, with little luck - and a few odd looks, as salespersons didn't understand why we would want to strap our furniture to the walls when we don't live in an earthquake zone. But trust me, once you find somewhere that sells them, buy them up. Once you see how well they work, you will become addicted to testing to see if you can tip your furniture - and will want them everywhere."	1
Not worth the $10 I paid especially when I had to spend $7 to ship it !!	0
"Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier, my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut. It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport.

Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back. 

I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts.

The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably. 

For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product"	1
"I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying ""Cheese"". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally.
It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made"	0
As im sure all mothers can relate, my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart. I looked at a lot of local stores for a cover. I couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt $80. This one is great! its reasonably priced, wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings. i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around, but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts!!	1
"I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon.  When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had ""liquid"" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is ""impossible"" for that kind of ""accident"" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) ""I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault."" Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation."	0
"I bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer, and he's used it once and tried to go in it several times, but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it. I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does ""go"" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary.

The only problems I've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly (mostly when it was new), simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes, the fact that my three-year-old still can't quite get it that he can't sit on it and do #2, and the fact that it's just a little off-balance, so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall, you could have an icky mess. Luckily, ours has only fallen over when filled with water"	1
"this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.

what i liked about it:
1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use
2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice
3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've used

what i disliked about it:
1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest
2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.
3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)

this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events"	0
My two and half year old kept telling me he wanted to stand up to go to the potty, like his older brother and daddy.  A friend recomended this product and when my little one saw it he was so excited.  He loves the fact that he can flush it all by himself	1
"I am a Nikon fan I have Nikon 6T and Nikon D50. But about Coolpix 4600:

I have had both the S5000 and the S5100 I was disapointed when my S5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but I was happy with the picture quality. I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. I am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable.	0
I bought this sheet for my Graco Pack n' Play and it fits great.  It's very soft and looks great wash after wash.	1
I had an S5000 but it dropped it and broke. So I decided to buy this model since I loved the S5000 so much. They took away so many of the great options and quality that the S5000 had...so now I just use a small Fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. It is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. I would suggest going with the S5000 even with lower Megapixels it is much better quality	0
I had one of these with my second son and loved it.  We just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary.  When it was hot out we could uncover him, and when we went into somewhere with air-conditioning we would just cover him up.  It is soft and cozy.  We found it so convenient.  We will be purchasing another one for number three, who's due in May. 	1
"This frame looks great until you turn it on. The picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. When you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. What does that mean you ask? That means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. You will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; This will not take advantage of the entire frame. If you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. I have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. See below.

The build quality of the frame is pretty good. If Mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen, this would be a nice little frame.

A little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio, but I figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image, making it look distorted. These steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. I set up a macro in Photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. You will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. Some of your images might be better served one at a time.
 
Start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program.
 
1. Go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels)
 
This will make the image look distorted. That is ok.
 
2. Then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels)
            
The image is ready to save. You might want to save as in to another folder so you
can go back to your original if needed.
 
3. Copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame"	0
This lamp is so much cuter than I was expecting. The quality looks excellent.  I looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for.  The quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others.	1

This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there.  The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality.  We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased.  I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!! 	1
They say 100% compatible but is not, because is not an info Ion-Litio, so is not a Eqivalent battery, dosn't work. Don't expend your money on this stupid batter	0
I havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated, but I guess I always check and make sure the lid is on right.  The suction isnt too fast, which is great.  My baby doesnt get choked.  She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves.  My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose.  There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose.  Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes.  Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer.  I still use the bottles, but I just have to make sure the whole time I'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath	1
Doesnt work even though the LENMAR website says it does. I thought it was a pretty good deal for $26. I wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	0
"We adopted a little boy when he was 2 days old.  He was slightly preemie and weighed just over 5 pounds.  He wouldn't have anything to do with the soothie for preemies, but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face.    We had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked, he didn't seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several: avent, dr. brown, gerber and playtex.  I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled.  In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon.  I love the width of the bottles because it's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean.  The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing.

Our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well.  This bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also.  Double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn't have any leaking problems.  I'm so glad I found these! "	1
Attention! I got this lenmar from Amazon. However, it is not compatible with my latest model of sony's dcr-hc96 camcorder! The camcorder warns you to use infolithium battery, and then shuts down. That's it	0
I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems	1
"I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it.  The display, contrast and brightness were great. 

However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.  

Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons."	0
"I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down. I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it, as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use. I knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones. I am a very price sensitive, I shop at consignment shops, etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it!

The reason I like this stroller:

1. You can guide it with one hand.
2. There is a spot for bags, etc underneath. 
3. The cup holder for mommy and child. (this is an extra accessory)
4. It's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily. 
5. The five point harnes"	1
"I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  Two of them stopped working.  One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  Unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  And inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.

I'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!!"	0
I did my research for the best stroller, thus this one is the best in market, travelling with my baby is much fun and easier.  I can carry, fold and move it with no help, its so easy to open and fold.  Its very cozy, my baby can sleep happily in it	1
"Received as a Christmas present, dead by February 24.  Well, actually, that's two months.  Now all it does is flash an error message, and nothing I do gets it out of that mode.

I liked it before it died on me"	0
For the price how can you go wrong, it is absolutely FULL FEATURED, besides a lot of features of the stroller itself, you get a uv shade cover, a raincover, and a cover for the legs (the boot; useful when it is cold). Easy to open and close, a breeze to push, I can even manage with one hand, baby is happy in it.  Only wish it could recline with one hand. The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller, get a bit stuck on ours, but maybe 'cos it is new. Even if I knew that would happen, I still would buy this stroller, it is something I can live with. It is almost half the price of the 2007 models, which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric. The color though is not really what I expected from a teal, it is more of a dirty blue	1
Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off	0

I purchased this for my 10 yr old son. I was surprised at how, well, cheap it appeared. We took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first, then it worked for about 10 minutes, then it never worked again and we had to return it. Amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly. We ended up buying the DGX 5.1 MP from a local store i it's place. It has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth. Not a professional photography instrument, but a pretty decent unit for him	0
I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model	1
"I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were ""acceptable,"" at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain"	0
"This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life.  While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him.

It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were.  We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too.

Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an ""Itzbeen II"" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!  (my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :"	1
We have had this camera for about a year.  We wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  The picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. We have a Canon Powershot A60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  I would not recommend this Polaroid camera to anyone	0
The Snuggle Nest gave my husband and I peace of mind while co-sleeping with our son.  I thought about purchasing the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper but my son wanted to be REAL close to us through the night.  Our son is ten weeks old and it still works.  It is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a Cesarean that proved to be a little difficult.  I'm hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the Snuggle Nest by putting the Snuggle Nest into his crib.  The little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night (the bedside light wakes my husband.	1
this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 GB memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't	0
"We had an old wooden cradle for the newborn. The Snuggle Nest made it snuggly, warm and comfy. However, it didn't work in our bed (queen size) because it was big and bulky. If you plan on using it in your bed buy ""inclined to sleep"" with positioners. Babies'R'Us sells it now. It's easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep."	1
The picture quality is okay, but the battery life is HORRIBLE	0
I am nursing our 2 wk old, and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us.  My husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby, so, he does not sleep well.  The snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep.  Also, the DVD has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself, because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help.  I only wish we would have bought this with second child	1
Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.	0
I've tried other cart covers and this one is the nicest.  It's big and, well, floppy!   It's padded so it keeps my son comfortable. You can put it on the cart with one hand.  I have to put my son in and then do the seat belt through the back.  It works great.  We leave it in the car and use it everywhere.  I bought it because when my  other son was a baby he got really sick a few days after a trip to the grocery store.  I've seen programs about what's on those cart seats (people put their raw meat in that section of the cart all the time - yuck)  I feel much safer now!!	1
"I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! 
She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and ""cool"" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.
Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!"	0
"Our Hungry Pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years.  

The bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing.  His fat cheeks squeak, his wings crinkle, and his feet rattle.  He comes with four sea creatures (crab, shrimp, fish, and octopus) that are each different textures and colors, and make different sounds (rattle, rustle, etc.).  Children can put the little animals into pelican's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy.  The large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again.

I found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds, colors, and textures of the four little sea creatures.  Toddlers progress to the eating game.

I am grateful to Mr. Pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning.  What can be better than that!

"This product saves time and for people that hygiene freak.....this is a good one. Wash yor baby bottle....dry them and sterilise as needed.
also I take to work to sterilise my pump and bottle before pumping with the parts since it is just few minutes"	1
Loved the concept of this camera...small, 10x zoom and sleek looking, BUT the first one lasted 3 days, had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week.   Both stopped operating completely.  So given that kind of problem I do not recommend this camera	0
"The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN!  I love these bags.  Note, I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster, since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping.

You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results.

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, it has been a lifesaver to me"	1
Broke the day after I got it. But when it worked I loved it	0
I only occasionally feed my baby, and my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle, so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes. As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes. ANd I don't use it every days, so I don't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using.	1
I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars.  I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit.  The set I received did not have the extention straps included.  The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back.  If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars.  They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture	0
I heard about these blankets from a co-worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter. They are the softest blankets I've ever felt. There's a reason this company's name is CloudB! The only reason I gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing - the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges. Not a big deal, I just snipped them with a scissors, but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished.	1
"This item was offered as a suggested accessory to the Nikon Monarch ATB 8X42 Waterproof Binoculars that I purchased.  I later also purchased the 12X42 Binoculars.  This harness CAN NOT be attached to either pair of binoculars!  The hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.

Other than that the harness is a well made quality product"	0
"I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it.  He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems.  I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing.  I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.  
Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it.  The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge.  I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Excellent product and service"	1
I have had several people take my pictures.At first,everything is fine.The pictures are ok.THE NEXT DAY,my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.It is soooo blury.Then it got 2 the point where every picture I took was blury.I tried fixing it online(like on the program for the camera)and it would not work.I HATE THIS CAMERA!!! Not to mention the battery sucks.It lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.This camera should be $99.00.TRUST ME PEOPLE......IF I COULD RATE THIS THING AT A ZERO I WOULD.IT IS NOT WORTH IT.HOWEVER,a camera i absolutely love is the Sony Cybershot DSCT5.An awesome little camera	0
I LOVE my Avent pump. Even though I knew I would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old, I was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until I knew if breastfeeding would be right for us. Now, my son is almost 6 months old and I'm still using my manual pump. I take 2 15-minute breaks each day and find that I can easily keep up with my son's milk needs. On the days that I have trouble getting my milk to flow, I find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump's efficieny. (On those nights, I nurse on one side while I pump on the other.) I would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price	1
It's not an item to write home about.  Final picture quality is usually OK but not spectacular.  The wi-fi works some days, mostly not.  If I'd known then what I know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser.	0
It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job	1
I've owned this camera a little over a year. It was my 2nd digital camera. It always had focus issues in low-light. I thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after I finally had some time, I discovered that it was the camera. You really need a tripod for those low-light shots. I wasn't able to return it, so I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. It takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen. However, the lens will no longer contract and I get an error message that is unresolvable unless I pay at least $170. I'm just going to get a better quality camera. I will not buy Sony again	0
I love this bottle dryer.  It was a little pricey but worth it! It holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop.  I never put bottles, binkies, etc. away anymore.  I just leave them because it is so convienent	1
This tripod seemed to be very nice...  Until we tried to extend the legs all of the way.  Two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended.  The locking devices are pretty poor.  They are made of a cheap plastic and I believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use.  Next time I will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock	0

It's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 PC's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. One of my PCs runs XP (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the Magpix) and the others run Win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the Magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). They gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition I wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. I suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product	0
I love this containers.  First of all, I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump, so these containers are perfect for me.  I express into these containers--freeze them--thaw them out--replace the sealing disc with the nipple--warm it up.  Then my husband is ready to feed the baby.  It's one of their times together, and I get to spend time with my older children.  Perfect	1
I purchased the WP-DC700 underwater case for my A70 and followed the directions exactly, oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use. It leaked and ruined my month old camera. Customer service was rude, blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested. The underwater case has a 7 DAY WARANTY and the camera is not covered for water damage. My father had a similar problem with his $1000 Nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. So beware of bad customer service. Canon's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the Better business Burea	0
I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle	1
"Very disappointed in this product and Amazon's response to the problem.

The Adorama Silica Gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. I emailed customer service at Adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond.

So far, money wasted. Unresponsive to my emails	0
I love my new stroller.  I also have a Graco travel system.  The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle.  I think the Peg steers very well, unlike what some other reviewers have said.  I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it.  It handled like a dream.  My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened.  It was a breeze!  We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs.  It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry.  You will be happy with this stroller	1

"If your looking for a no frills chair this is the one.  I didn't find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat.  It does recline but I keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old.  She seems to like it better that way.

 The only thing I would complain about is I don't care for the way the belt is.  I may be using it incorrectly (at least it seems like that) but it holds the baby (and that's what it's meant for)"	1
The main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away. The quality is very poor. The unit is very bulky to carry around your neck. The SD card slot has some block in it. I was not able to even insert an SD card. All in all, not satisfied at all	0
The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you, it was the best choice ever. I have no real experience with any other wipes, but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color...THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE. I love that I just put the whole pack in, plastic and all, and it stays nice and toasty for my son's bottom. He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore. I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top. I love that it heats from the top. The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist. I also love the little handle on the top, so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be! The product is hight recommended	1
The camera is just plain cheap. Takes nothing but fuzzy, low resolution pictures. The thing weighs a ton and even for all that the binoculars are only mediocre. A great idea, maybe someday someone will actually do it right	0
 I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing. Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son. I had received a free Avent nurser, so I tried it and the problem was eliminated. I bought the newborn set and some extras, not cheap, but worth it for a content baby! I was quite upset when they began leaking, then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don't tighten as much as possible, if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn, they don't leak! No gas, no leaks, happy baby	1

I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies-r-us, but it was so much more expensive. This is perfect for my new baby girl. I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too. Also, there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set. The lamp, rug, and mobile are a must! =) The set comes with only one window valance, and as my nursery has 2 windows, I had to purchase an additional valance. Just something to keep in mind when buying this	1

This nursery care kit is great!  Before buying another care kit consider the following points, with the time and frustration you will save... you'll be glad you did.  The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times.  It is very gentle but very effective.  The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use.  So much better than the glass and mercury kind.  The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby.  The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby's finger.  Anyone that has ever cut their baby's  finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that!  The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store.  Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you're on the go	1
"I read all the reviews and comments on this Kodak printer I could find. Many gave glowing reviews. I'd just purchased a new Kodak digital camera, and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup. 

I was never able to get the printer to perform as Kodak says it should. It caused some odd conflict, and my computer would not boot into Windows XP with the printer attached to the computer. I ended up having to disconnect the printer, turn on my computer, and then reconnect the printer in order to use it. Windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers. It was made even more frustrating by Kodak's tech support. I called and emailed multiple times for assistance. In one conversation I was literally told ""I don't know what's wrong and can't help you."" Now that's tech support!

Finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper. I tried all Kodak's remedies, none worked. No matter how much or how little paper was in the machine, it said there was no paper. I even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print.

I can't recommend this printer. I could give a better recommendation had Kodak itself, through its tech support, at least have provided my with some competent assistance. I got about 2 dozen prints, quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all.

About the only positive I can give is that the prints I did get looked good, the color was nice. I gave it an extra star for print quality alone.

Kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time. It was synonymous with home photography once upon a time. They've lost something over the years, and that is quality"	0
This is a great price for a 4 pc set. (I got ours at walmart for $35) The comforter is not thick and plushy.  Its very thin and stiff.  But then again, for the price, its ok.  The sheets are adorable.  We bought a very soft, fuzzy Dora blanket to go with it.  But the comforter that comes with it is definately cute.  Maybe after a few washes it will soften up some.  I would still buy it again for the price.  But if you are looking for a thick, soft warm comfoter, then this is not the one you want	1
"I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.

It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.

Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. 

I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.

When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.

Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.

I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.

If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.

I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics. "	0

"I bought these strap covers:
1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and
2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time!
This product solved both problems.  When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft.  Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat"	1

This is a great item, but, it does have some flaws. I got this for my 2 month old, and he loved it! Now he's 6 months and loves it just as much. The thing is, you need to manually push the button, and then you can use the remote. After it plays all the music, and it shuts off, the only way to turn it back on, is to press the button yourself. Not great when you're flying on the freeway! But, it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on	1

I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!	1

In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.

I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	0

I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =	0
Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it	1
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera	0

"There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  ""If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction.""  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!  "	0

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision."	0
I bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles.They were to fast for her .Like  the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that didn't gag her. Great for little babies that can't control their flow control	1
"This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??"	0
I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems	1
I was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this Ziga Digital Frame. I returned it	0
I was able to put this dresser together by myself and I was 6 months pregnant.  The overall look is beautiful.  A great buy for the money.  I did buy the fabric railing protectors from babies-r-us to protect the round railings from a teeting baby since it is made of pine and they fit perfectly	1
"This is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures.  And it takes wonderful video. The downloading is easy and in general it's a ""fine"" camera.  However....

the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare.  It's constantly over exposing every subject.  I find it practically un-usable.  The only way I can get the image I'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the ISO to 800.  If it had a 1600 ISO I wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that.  

The other thing I don't like that I didn't realize I wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries.  The batteries have to be removed and charged seperately.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it.  The batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice.  Intensely dissatisfying.  

This camera also has a REALLY LONG DELAY from pushing the button to taking the picture.  This results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces.  I know that most digitals have a delay but this one is EPIC.  

I am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a Canon.  I am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my Canon 5D.  But since this was rated Camera of the Year by American Photo (a publication I trust implicitly), I decided to stray from my Canon.  bad idea.  I'm going right to a PowerShot.  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.  I reccommend you do the same."	0

This camera/Mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true! I brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies. But I was sadly mistaken... This camera just takes cheap pictures and videos. The only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that I had no need for. After about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better I gave up and sold it on eBay for the same price as I brought it for. It's a great idea... but it just isn't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice. The Mp3 player isn't all that wonderful either. It doesn't work with iTunes. Or easy work with Windows. Hope this helps... I wish I would have read this before I brought this camera	0

I will say the camera takes decent pictures (as the previous reviews state, almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with

I know that after looking at the price tag, one might be confused why I say economical; however, when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands (for those exploding messes) - they are a value.  These wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe  most of the time.  Of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe I've ever seen.  I have only positive remarks for these wipes	1
This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures.  I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality	0
I installed this today though I haven't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy. I was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo, but after getting it and installing it, it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me. It also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat. I'm giving the chair five stars because I can't think of anything negative about it	1
"I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day. 
I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money.
I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option"	0
I wanted to respond to the other review.  If you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere, please know that the curtains are a darker stripe (not the tan plaid).  But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker, the border on the wall hangings and quilt, the trim on the hamper, etc.  It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern	1
"I was extremely disappointed with this product; I felt very let down by Sony, because for years I bought Sony items with confidence, knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable.  This item only goes to prove that Sony's standards have dropped and, as such I will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs.
What lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up; 2 metres (not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping) was the best I could do, and that was in a straight line.  No, all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin"	0
"My husband and I ordered these pictures for our sons nursery. Our theme is Barn Yard, we also got the coordinating lamp, light-plate switch and night light. These pictures really help to complete the room.

I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for the perfect picture to complete their nursery!"	1
Crap.  Doesn't work.  Wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period.  Plastic junk, never did get a good signal.  The worst Sony item I've ever purchased -- and I'm a Sony fan.  Will still attempt to return somehow.  Don't even bother	0
this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall	1
"I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a ""clone"" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know"	0
"I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give.

"Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

"I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.  They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.  They worked great.

I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews, in that they claim this piece is flimsy. It is NOT at all flimsy, nor does it look cheap. In fact, my husband and I have the entire set (changing table and dresser), along with the Montery Crib.  When you receive the boxes, there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer, not the store, will handle all returns, exchanges, or shipping of missing parts. Well, we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect. We spoke with Storkcraft directly, and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly. Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant, and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY, and they would arrange for a prompt exchange.  This piece looks beautiful, and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser. I am sure that you could spend $1,000 on a high-end piece, but if you are looking for something that is 1) AFFORDABLE, and 2) WELL-MADE, and 3) BEAUTIFUL, then Storkcraft is a good choice	1

I thought she was old enough to go without swaddling, boy was I wrong.  It took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size.  I have had my large Swaddle Me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then.  Thank you Swaddle Me for helping me keep my sanity	1

Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap.  I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free.  The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes.  If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.  This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby.  And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all	1

I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU).  Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.	1

"My daughter is breastfed, but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one (with pumped milk and/or formula).  We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers!  Refused to drink from the bottle.  Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles (not every day, but at least once per week).  I tried a Dr. Browns and it was the same problem.  And it didn't matter if it was breastmilk, forumula, warm, cold, room-temp, etc.  She just screamed!

during this time, she had been using a Platex ortho pacifier, but had begun using the soothie pacifer I got from the Hospital.  She didn't like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with...took several months for her to like it.  Anyway, I randomly had a freebie Soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that I thought I might as well try.  she took it immediately!!

I have since bought several more in preparation for daycare, and she still takes them with no problems (she's 4 months now).  I have not had any problem with leaks, and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with Avent.  

My only problem, is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle.  However, the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow, so as long as its kept upright it does okay.  I have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the Soothie to feed. "	1

These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair.	0

While these aren't waterPROOF, they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear.

I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products	0

"I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera. 

The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.

I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft."	0

"We bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all ""EuroCam"" for an upcoming trip to Europe. It promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip.
 
Sadly, the camera is not up to filling this role. We will need to take another camera along with it. However, we will take the V705 for its wide-angle lens, the reason that we picked this model in the first place. It is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review.

The need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. If you do not need a 23mm lens, or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens, then you do not need this otherwise mediocre P&S (Point and Shoot) camera. 

Good: Fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; The 23mm is the default lens; Rapid start-up time; Internal focus and zoom; Chromatic aberration well controlled; Can use 4GB cards; Freeze-frame and extract any video frame.

Mediocre: Soft images; Perceptible shutter lag; Slow shot-to-shot times; Exposure compensation is easy, but steps are too small for digital, and is reset when camera turned off; Flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; Image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; Flimsy construction; No manual controls; No RAW format; No optical viewfinder; Histogram on display, but too small to be useful.

Bad: The Absolute Worst menu system to be found on a camera; Excessive and unadjustable JPEG compression; Poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; Unacceptable visual noise starting at ASA-400; Forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images, with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; Panoramic component images forced to 5MP; Overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); MPEG-4 video compression gives very poor results.

Synopsis:

If you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot, this, and the older V570, are the only choices.

If most of your images are in bright light, the 7MP V705 gives better images. If most images will be in low light, the older, cheaper, 5MP V570 is the better choice.
 
The camera seems very fragile. Treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. If you chose this as your sole camera, you will likely be unhappy with your choice.

The ONLY reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens. 

= = = = =  Some Expanded Comments  = = = = =

Twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. This lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. On power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens, which is ideal for us. However, considering that this is truly a specialty lens, it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. Best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. Better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens.

The camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. This works fairly well, at the cost of even more image softness, but even-so, barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. This in-camera correction can be turned off. Doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance.

However, being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. The only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as:  manual settings, a physically larger sensor chip, RAW image files, or, at least, a choice of degree of JPEG compression.

At the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. There are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom', so, as with all digicams, the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. After reaching optical zoom limits, one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program.

Kodak's advertised ""5X Optical Zoom"" is, at best, misleading. Actually, it is just flat out untrue. The camera has two lenses. The only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens, which is not quite 3:1. The wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (Note, in some places Kodak claims 39-114, in others 39-117 optical zoom.)
 
Also misleading is the claimed ""Anti-blur technology."" As best I can tell from looking at the images, and at the EXIF metadata, all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the ASA. Certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera.

Speaking of ASA. This is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. It is Byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. To adduce, `Auto' ASA ranges from 50-200, to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. To change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! On either of the other two P&Ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. The menu system is next to unusable in the field.

Still on ASA settings, the camera does have sensitivities up to ASA/ISO 1000 (though the manual only documents ASAs up to 800, 1000 is available on the camera). Unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime, will never-happen-again moment, then 200 is the max ASA tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. At 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5"".

The previous version of this camera, V570, had only 5MP, but the same sensor size. By increasing the pixel count, but not the physical size of the sensor, the new V705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. This has happened with many of the current P&S cameras, as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality.  My initial experience with low-light high ASA use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 MP, as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact.

Another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which, when calibrated to the sensor in the camera, allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. Doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10"" prints at ASA 800. If one really wants to get carried away, combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at ASA 1000 doable. People willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit Kodak's target market.

Back to earth.

The V705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7MP P&S cameras. Mostly I believe this is because of the overly aggressive JPEG compression, which is not adjustable (e.g. `best', `good', etc). My guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. This results in small files, with a lot of compression artifact. The 7MP JPEGs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5MB in size, those from another 7MP P&S I have are 5-6MB. My 6MP prosumer digital SLR JPEGs are 8-10MB. The more the compression, the worse the image. Most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. Kodak picks it for you, and picks poorly.

The V705's video performance is very disappointing. It uses MPEG-4 compression, and at very aggressive compression settings. Unless it is a video of your baby's first steps, or aliens landing in the backyard, you will likely find it hard to watch. The total output datastream is about 0.5 MBS. Compare this with a miniDV tape video datastream of 25 MBS (total, adding sound, error correction, and time codes, is 36 MBS). Better to have stuck with MPEG-2 which would give less compression, but decent enough (TV quality) videos. That is the choice that most manufactures have made. As a result, the videos from my other P&Ss have about a 2 MBS datastream, and so are of much better quality.

The battery. Kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. I am getting 100-120, with minimal use of flash and the LCD on `energy saver'. Even 150 would be poor, compared with my other digital P&Ss, where I expect at least 200, and often get 250+ if I am at all careful with power-management. This camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mAh battery. My (several) other, P&Ss have 790-1120 mAh batteries, and, I suspect, more efficient processors.

Since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle, the battery will likely last most of a day. We have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera.

Though the body is of aluminum, the camera itself is overall fragile and I doubt will hold up more than a year or two. The battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. The media door often dislodges open.

Truly, my belief is that Kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) ""EasyShare"" dock system. This would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory, and the overly aggressive JPEG compression.

Shutter lag, the b�te noire of digital cameras, is very evident with this model. I do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter, and the image being recorded. However, based on over 50 years of tripping shutters, it clearly varies, and I estimate is, at best 1/4  second, up to a bit over 1/2 second. In addition to the shutter lag, there is a perceptible lag in the LCD viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. Together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment, an active child at a particular instant, or a wary animal almost impossible. The shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price P&S cameras from other makers.

The accompanying `manual' is poorly organized, childishly written. ""Finish reading this book, so you can take and share your best pictures!""  At best, it was written for 8 year olds.

The manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual', however the address given is incorrect. When eventually found, the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level.

Panoramics, one of the advertising points of the camera, are another disappointment. Basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode', each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image, in order to allow alignment. As with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. So far, this is all OK; however, it rapidly goes downhill.

First, the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) MP. Next, the image overlay is so dark that, even with the LCD set at max brightness, it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements.

However, it gets worse.

The images MUST be joined in-camera! The individual images cannot be stored! In-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. Aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2"" LCD in the field gives, in spite of the camera's best efforts, much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger, and higher quality, computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home.

The best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment, and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7MP single-stills, making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. Of course, my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera, so we will not be dragging it along. You can eyeball the needed EC close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. Much better if the V705 allowed the individual images to be saved.

Reading back through this review, I see that it is mostly negative. This makes sense, for, as I disclosed at the beginning, it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. Likely I have said all that needs to be said.

So I will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens.  Except for this unique lens, the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced P&S cameras currently on the market.

If you need a true wide-angle P&S, you need this camera. Otherwise forget it"	0
"I bought this same crib in May of 2005 from Buy Buy Baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble I did it while I was pregnant. It had no scartches or chips. I like it a lot and my daughter loves it. we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2. But its very roomy. It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much.
I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we're very very happy with. In fact we bought another one from amazon, for my son. My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1. He likes it a lot too. But even though company and everything is the same. the crib did come with some damaging to it, but it wasnt that bad, you dont really notice it, we got lucky i guess. But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off. The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought. I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues. But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one. But its definately worth the buy. AND it came with SUPER FAST SHIPPING with amazon. and the shipping was free too. But its well worth the buy!!!!!! My kids are happy and so im happy!!"	1
I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!	0
I ordered this at Christmas with the free super saver shipping.  The crib arrived within a week.  Assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable.  It's attractive, but my only complaints are 1)it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint (this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint) and 2) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps.  Overall, I'm very happy with the crib AND the price- can't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in May	1
"I ordered a case for my Kodak DX6490 digital camera from ANTONLINE thru AMAZON but received a case that is inches too small for my camera.  If the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  In spite of this ANTOLINE has refused to issue an RMA for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if I return without their RMA. They tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  The only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  Is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? I guess I could go to the airport and put it through the screener.

There is a little tag on the case that reads DX6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height, depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice. When I checked Kodak online, the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions.

Amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either. At this point I would never patronize ANTOLINE again"	0

This crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for. Our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it's way. Great customer service. The quality of the bed is outstanding. We purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes	1
This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part.  It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping.  I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  For only $12.  Next time, I'll be smarter! 	0
"My wife and I just finished putting this crib together.  It took a total of 25 minutes start to finish.  The instructions were extremely easy to follow.  We bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well, we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two.  Our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together.  The only adjustments we have done, where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower.  Even that process only took a matter of minutes.  I have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up.  When ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough, but the crib pieces inside are very well packed, padded, and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish.  The super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase.  I have never wrote a review for an online purchase before, but we are so pleased with our two cribs that I wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib.  
P.S.  I'm a physician and this crib could not be any safer...no solid side walls or backing...just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part"	1

"Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly ""white"" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase"	0
My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself. So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don't have to worry. They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat. Great product! I highly recommend it!!!!	1
"I too, loved the camera, despite the small LCD screen size, until it got the infamous White Screen of Death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs AFTER the warranty expires (1 year).  Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80).  Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.  

White screen of death temporary solution:  Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the ""Cybershot"" logo on the front of the camera.  Then turn it back on.  Repeat if necessary.  It'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop"	0

Like others, mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in I turn it on in still mode. Bought in December 2005, it is now not working.  It is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and Sony is not addressing it. Sony should be forced to recall these cameras.	0

I loved my 4.1mp Sony Cypershot I got for Christmas in 2005. Then a few days after Christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it. If I would tap the camera they would go away. But then a few days later I was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working. It would turn on but then shut off. I had this problem before with low batteries but I changed them and it still didn't work. It would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. So many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. SO SAD CAMERA DEA	0

"The crib just the way it comes is best.  A thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons.  Firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers.  Bumber pads are also recommended against by *all* modern advice sites and classes.  SIDS deaths appear to be related to suffocation, and this happens usually when the baby's mouth and nose are against padding.  Firm mattress (like this very thin one) are much safer.  The main thing is to always lay the infant on it's back to sleep, and not on it's belly.  Also, never use a bumber padding in *any* crib for any very young child.  Finally, there is also the issue of ""outgassing"" of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling.   What you want, if you can't afford the very expensive natural options, is a *thin* mattress like this one, that won't have a lot of material to outgas, thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic VOCs.  Best is to buy this a few weeks (or longer) ahead of time, and then air out the mattress.  I'm even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point, so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle.  This is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing, so that our new baby in January won't have much VOCs to breath."	1

My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit.  It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper.  The price is also not bad at all.

I researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born. After she was two weeks old, and my milk supply was established, I decided to purchase a pump. I had read many reviews about ISIS and was so skeptical...and I didn't want to pay $300 for an automatic one. I enjoy breastfeeding so much, however, I am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too. After much thought, I decided to purchase the ISIS &amp;quot;back to work&amp;quot;. It came with the pump, bottles and the tote (which by the way is very discreet). I had no trouble assembling it at all. From the first time I used ISIS I've had great success. I am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes, without any pain or discomfort as I control the suction. Our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all, nor have we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking. I assemble the pump and the nipples/rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet. I love how easy this is to use and I don't have to find a place to plug it in at work.

"I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill.

Very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair, despite that I do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the Tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes.

"I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it. 

Unfortunately, that evening I had trouble docking our new Sony camcorder, and when I looked at the bottom of the camcorder, I saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! To my great relief, I was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. I was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not ""consumer error."" (I can't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then I can't dock the camcorder... bad on Sony there...but still.) 

Your mileage may vary, but this tripod is going back to Amazon, and I'll be shopping for another brand."	0
The gate works well. It is a little hard to move the panels, but overall works well	1
"I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.     

One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a ""real"" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization ""person"".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony"	0
"i had this highchair delivered  to my new great grandaughter so I am reporting what they said about    it.  ""Great"	1

My baby has used this since she was 4 months old It has a sturdy wide base..It has height adjusters...you can recline it..very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair.  I dont find it hard to clean ..it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it's on sale ..I paid full price :(  	1
These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair.	0
"I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective.  The crotch snap does not work properly.  When I contacted Baby Trend, they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free, even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 & I contacted them in December - less than a month after I bought it.

Otherwise, this is a wonderful seat.  I love the triangular handle.  I use it with the Snap & Go and have no trouble at all transferring her.  If she falls asleep in it, it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her.  She seems very comfortable in it as well.  She was born November 12, 2006.

The hood is such that it can block out the sun, no matter from which direction it is shining.  And you can still see her face - if you are tall enough.

The product is great - if yours if fully functioning.  I'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat.  As it is, I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can't spring for another seat now.  I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason"	1
Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars.  One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA.  I am returning this product	0
"This is our first and only child seat and has worked quite well for us. We do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby's head. There have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies' head muscles aren't very strong, the support is a good addition.  I find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat, you will not want to cary this very far at all.  My wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house !  Some day, these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents.  I don't know that it would have been different in another seat, but be warned, these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth. It's a terrible combination.  Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late.

Back to the seat, it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap-n-go. We use the snap-n-go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in (which can be trying for you and your kid).

I was disappointed the unit had no SPF rating for the sun shade. That feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it wouldn't be difficult to use a protective fabric.  I called Baby Trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful UV rays.  Other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital.  Babies have super sensitive skin and it's important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible. I know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the American Adadamy of Pediatrics ([...]). For now, you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover.

Pros: Consumer report top pick, not as expensive as some

Cons: No SPF rating or sun UV protection listed for sun shade. Heavy and non ergonimic to cary by hand (not a complaint specific to this particular seat, they probably all are)"	1

We bought this crib online & couldn't be more pleased.  The shipping was great - a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable.  The directions aren't bad - but they could be a lot better/clearer.

I'm really pleased with this crib.  The price was right and it arrived within a matter of days.  Shipping and handling costs were very low.  A few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow.  Otherwise, it looks great and is very sturdy.  Great crib for the price	1
"Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible. 

It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, ""case"" would be stretching the definition somewhat"	0
We loved this product and our little girl loved it even more!  We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months.  We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in.  We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped.  We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often.  At just 14 months, she could jump with both feet off the ground.  It is a quality product at a reasonable price.  Would highly recommend	1
"Cheaply made and ill-fitting, this ""deluxe"" case isn't worth half the price.  There is no handle or wrist strap provided; your camera's strap becomes the carry handle.  A small, snap-strap is provided, but I can't figure out what it's for... the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure, and I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case, much less with the heft of a camera inside.  Don't buy this item:  Amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage, because it's not their fault you don't like it... and you WILL be returning it.  Save yourself the trouble. "	0
This is my third child and third infant car seat.  This was the most expensive, but worth the money.  The padding keeps the baby's head from that scary 90 degree flop; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids; the straps don't get twisted and it's much easier to get in and out of the car.  It's the same weight as the others (which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry).  The only thing I don't like is it does not fit on shopping carts.  Worth the money	1

"I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005.  It has held up really well.  My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep.  I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever ""made"" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.  

I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection.  You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone."	1
"The default supplier for this item is Adorama.  They have sku numbers mixed up on the back end, so they will ship you the HP 6221 dock instead.  Will not work with the R series.
They do not even carry the actual HP 8887 dock.  
Huge hassles, so click on the new and used link and buy directly from Amazon.  It's a few dollars more, but at least you get the right item"	0
"I ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other Zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality & softness of the fabrics. It's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy.
I have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed, so what I did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition. I also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa I have in the room."	1
"I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug).

HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation.

I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it"	0

This is a great walker. The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger. My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely. Amazon sells model #14570, so don't worry, the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary. Also, a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk	1

I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be, I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby. However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process	1

"The first night we had our daughter home, she would wake up about every 45 minutes. My wife and I were pulling shifts to take care of her. Finally, at 6am, my wife says, ""Hey, lets try the secure sleeper that we bought"". We haven't removed it from her bassinet since. The product does as it says and we swear by it. She is only 2 1/2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5-6 hrs a night. The velcro ""rolls"" can adjust to the babies size. The previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large. Given the size of the secure sleeper, it's not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper. Overall, a great product!"	1
This is first Canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. They must acquire them from their Chinese supplier for about 98 cents. This plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. I bought it to use with the Canon 250D close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. Canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks.	0
"Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work. 

Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem.

I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere. 

Highly recommend"	1
I had JVC product and some of my friends too. These are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem. Even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly. Price may be less buy its not worth for long run. I feel Sony and Canon are better than JVC. Even Hitachi is good	0
Great for organizing baby's food in your diaper bag. Caution: not leak-proof, be sure to properly seal leftovers! Love the slots that hold spoons.	1
"I purchased this camera from Amazon recently.  The FIRST time around, the camera tape door wouldn't shut the very first time I opened it.  I returned the camera and Amazon was great about replcing it promptly.  The SECOND time around, the DV port worked once, and ONLY once.  There's a short in it.  There is a REASON this camera is so cheap.  It's J U N K!!  I will add that a friend of mine is on her second JVC as well.  A fact I did not know until all of this came about.  

For two stars, I'll say the video quality is good.  The camera battery does hold a full 60 min. charge.  I had NO sound issues what so ever.  Background noise?? none here.
As for still pictures, if you don't know what you're doing as far as shutter speeds, back light, etc. FORGET IT.  The still pictures are very grainy.  If you want professional looking stills, do NOT buy a camcorder for this purpose.

JVC tech support is USELESS.

Camcorder comes with a USB wire to upload still only.  As on ANY digital camcorders, you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port.  You need a firewire.  This does not come with one.  Also, you need to check if you HAVE a firewire port on your computer.

I paid app. $25 dollars here on Amazon including shipping, for a port and firewire.  It took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower.  It's no big deal.

Amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time, only refund my money.  This camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when I bought it last month.  

Overall, AMAZON was great about service and return, however, this particular JVC item is JUNK"	0

I highly recommend this item.  As soon as your little one can sit up on his own, this is a MUST HAVE for all moms.  It fits all shopping carts (except COSTCO, but including TARGET) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants.  It keeps baby (and Mommy's hands) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart.  A MUST HAVE! This is the gift I give at baby showers.  I've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach.  Still looks good	1
"It's unfortunate that with a name like Canon, you expect a quality camera.  That's why you shell out the money for an item that you think Canon will stand behind.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.

I bought this camera to use in graduate school (industrial design).  I needed it to do research for my thesis.  I figured between that, all the product photographs, and the need good portfolio pieces, spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment.  I was wrong.

About a month after I bought the camera, it started to malfunction.  The lens got stuck and would not come out.  Neither would it go all the way back in, so the lens cover would not close (not only putting the lens in danger, but draining the battery as well.)  It was still under warranty, so I sent it to the Canon Service Center in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.  It was received, and I was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days.  That was almost a month and a half ago.

I have put my thesis research on hold because I do not have the proper camera for it.  Every time I call the service center, I am told that the ""parts are on back order"".  Evidently they don't know when these shipments are due in their center, so they don't know when I will have my camera back.  The best part is, when I called two weeks ago, they offered me a ""brand new"" S215.  The told me it was a great deal and that I should accept the offer because ""they NEVER do THAT"" (meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair.)  I pointed out that the S215 was only 5mp, had a smaller screen, and cost nearly 300.00 less than MY camera.  I also reminded her that MY camera was brand new when it broke and I had to send it in.

Today I was told that there was no information on my camera, the backordered parts, or when they could send my camera back.  The woman on the phone asked me why I didn't accept the S215 that was offered, and when I explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine, she said they were not authorized to do that.  I told her that I was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and Canon Corporate Headquarters, and she suddenly had a technician she could consult, and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week.  I won't hold my breath, but a copy of this review will be sent to Canon."	0

"This S80 used to be the only WIDE ANGLE compact point and shoot digital camera on the market. It has now been discontinued I'm told. But, we're in luck!

So, you NEED THIS CAMERA! Otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving Aunt Sylvia out of the ""Christmas Group Photo"" this year---and she'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) If you agree or disagree or know of ANY other digital point and shoot camera that has a WIDE ANGLE lens please write, Email:boland7214@aol.

"I received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, I ran into an error message: ""Unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery.""  I did what I was told.  Several times.  Same message.  Argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, I read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  I searched the web looking for a solution, but all I found were perhaps hundreds of people with the SAME message on similar JVC model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from JVC once their warranty ran out.  Luckily I ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product.

Sure, you might not believe me when I suggest to stay clear of this model.  I'm constantly disregarding Amazon reviews that preach ""do not buy this product!"", etc.  That's why I'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.

My husband and I received this changing table, along with the 4-drawer chest and the Monterey crib, as a gift from our parents. We were skeptical, because we wanted a nursery that was affordable, yet not too flimsy.  We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together. The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery, and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood. And the nicest part is that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery. My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are. * The only reason I rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled. It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks, took 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a beautiful, quality nursery that is affordable, this is a great choice	1
Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.

We were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the Britax Marathon carseat on display had a Gogo Babyz Travelmate attached to it.  It was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun. Two large, solid, screw-in knobs attach the Travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat.  The whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use.  We bought both the Marathon and Travelmate. We were looking for a better alternative to the Sit 'n Stroll.  This may be it.  I cannot compare the two options as I have never tried the Sit 'n Stroll, only read the so-so reviews.	1

This pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months, I still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned.  (The instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss, so hopefully that problem is avoidable.)  However, beware that the motor is very loud -- I definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet.  (When I use it, I sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn't have to hear it!)  I also recommend buying the micro-steam bags by Medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them	1
I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  We had to send the unit back.  I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item. 	0
I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once. This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need. I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort. I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied. Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place	1
"This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from.

The first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of ""600x."" Do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x, the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. 

The finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate, and this is not even that big.  Finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration.  the 1 1/4"" size of the eyepiece is creditable, but too high a mignification for this scope.  And the field of view is in doubt, and don't even think of using the barlow.  Buy this scope, and after a few outings, it will most likely sit in the attic.  The review immediately before mine is correct. This is no way to get started in astronomy.

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope. Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys. 

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6"" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

I purchased the Medela Double Select Pump in anticipation for the arrival of my second child per the recommendation of a relative who had great success with this model (we both had a terrible time with manual pumps in the past).  I am extremely pleased with this pump.  I can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction, motor, malfunctioning equipment, etc.  It is extremely easy to put together and take apart, as well as easy to clean.  You will have to buy a pack of Medela bottles before the first use as they are not included.  And yes, the motor is a little noisy, but not unbearably so.  It has neither disrupted my children's sleep, for example, nor become irritating for me.  It is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side.  Additionally, the Medela company has a very solid reputation and I understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products.  I think that this pump is a wise choice for part-time use (not more than once or twice a day, at that).  I've had much success and I think that most of you will too	1
"This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  

3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then.  I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year.  I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused.  The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time.  The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.  I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off.  I still very much like this product as it gets the job done	1
My wife purchased this for me as a Christmas present.  It started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months.  I've called Digital Spectrum, sent faxes and emailed them.  This has been going on for nearly a month.  A real waste of money & my time	0
I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work.  I used it FREQUENTLY (at least twice daily) for the 5 months I pumped at work.  It always worked wonderfully.  I never had trouble with let-down or supply.  Sometimes I filled both 8 oz. bottles in a 15-minute session!  Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply, I can't imagine this pump not working great.  I didn't have any problems with it the whole time I used it	1
Far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc. works fine though.	0
We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement. 	1
The plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately. Also, be sure to note that there is no memory card. Spend the extra money and buy something better. I wish I had	0
I ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to Florida on vacation...It is absolutely perfect...folds small, has room for storage, you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars...it really is perfect for travel...actually, it is perfect for anytime.	1
I bought this for my wife and she loved it. But it broke after the Amazon return policy was up. I contacted the company by Email twice and have not heard from them.	0
We bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline, was lightweight, and continues to be a functional, comfortable stroller for our son.  The one feature that I expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined...it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go.  I was happy with the amount of storage, but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag.  All in all, we are very happy with this purchase!     	1
I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon.	0
"We were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler, but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night.  This crib bumper does the job.  When he stands on it, it collapses, so it's no help boosting him over the side.

My one gripe (which I'm not sure there's a way around) is that there's a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail (the one that slides up and down).  Because our little one is older, we put stuffed animals in the corners, but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught"	1
Have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid.  Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and  error.  After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance.  Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames.  Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist.	0
I love this bumper. It isn't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely, without bunching. And the price is much more reasonable than the $$ bumpers that go with bedding sets. Mostly I can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings. I know his arms and legs won't get tangled in the railings, but he also can breathe. Great product. It is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib.	1
This frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter. The idea was great but the frame wasn't. It was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand. She sent it back and bought one she loves from Sam's Warehouse.	0

"The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price"	0
"My daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) likes this cot, a lot.
I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M-I-L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib.  

She sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon, which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her (darkened) room.  

It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don't have to haul her port-a-crib.  

The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it, of course, but... it's a cot! 

She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time, so I figured I'd buy it for my M-I-L at home.  It does the trick and my baby thinks it's special.  I tell her that it's only for when Grandma S is over (b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time).  

Naturally, I'd prefer she take a longer nap, so I told her it's for special days only, when Grandma S is here.  So now she uses it to ""tuck in"" her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night.  

I love it, and it seems comfortable, very portable and handy.  I would recommend it.  

The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip, but I wanted to review it now, in case you were wondering whether or not to get it.  I think it's very much worth it, but everyone's different.  It's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends.

Also, it is very sturdy & supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all.

Hope that helps"	1
You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.	0
I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors	1
"Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)

Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories"	0
My son was 20 lbs at 6 mos., so we had to stop using front carriers :(  I bought the Combi as well as this one and this one is much more user friendly (SO easy to get on and off by yourself) and much more comfortable. I've read reviewers saying it's uncomfortable...well if you have a big baby...it's just going to be uncomfortable! They're heavy! But this is the best one & it's nice to give your arms a break! The neck strap is well padded and easy to switch from one side to the other (for relief) w/o taking the baby out. It's compact enough to keep with you. And if you're baby just needs to be close to you or held sometimes...it's a MUST HAVE! We took a trip last week and it was PRICELESS! One tip: read the instruction manual and you will enjoy this product a ton more	1
"I owned this Sony for a single day before I returned it to Amazon.  First off, it records in MPEG2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer.  It is also not natively supported on the Mac without a 20$ additional Quicktime MPEG2 plugin.  Which has to be converted before editing. Which makes it a slow, tedious affair.  Also, the included software is, surprise, PC only.  
  Other problems, not computer related - the Chroma shift in ""night mode"" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly.  I'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(Sony).  The auto white balance could also use the same attention.

  Like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a PC.  The LCD touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use.  All in all, I would go for a Canon"	0
For all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled, that is incorrect. It was the original Hip Hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves. So unless you have an older model that was bought before 2/2005, you should have nothing to worry about. This product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the Baby Bjorn. I have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies.	1
I bought this camera in about February 2005 but didn't know enought about digital to know what I can actually get.  Goes through batteries pretty fast.  The recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot.  Takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture.  I just thought this was normal for digital cameras till I began reading later reviews.  Then I accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on.  Contacted HP to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one.  So I am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a Canon or Sony or something besides an HP	0
I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I'd have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on.  My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using.  I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat - I wish I had bought this seat from the get go	1
"I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says ""auto focus"", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera"	0
Out of all the department stores here, I got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph, for the easness. It got noted as lighter and easier to deal with. I secound the so far so good comment earlier.. Its comfortable than most seats I have shopped for besides the #1 Britax that I have yet to experience:)	1
"We bought one of these in the spring of '05. We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the ""reconditioned"" camera.  It has been OK since then. 
 HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to.
 This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot.
 All in all, disappointing. I will never buy another HP camera"	0
I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby!  They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink.  She has no idea that it's not a bottle.  It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier.  Thank you	1
"Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share.

My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.

Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.

And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.

I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months"	0
I absoulutly love these cups.  They are the best no-spill cups on the market.  My 1-year old loves to walk around with it and throw it around.  It never spills which is a great thing when I have red Kool-Aid in it!!!	1
"I have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now, so as someone with alot of experience with it, I advise you NOT TO BUY ONE.  I wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks...

- Without buying a memory card, this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above VGA.
- Non HP memory cards are incompatible.
- It EATS UP batteries, seriously.
- It shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever.
- It will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable.

At this point, I am shopping for a new camera because my M407 claims that brand new batteries are ""depleted"" and shuts off, lovely"	0
"My son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby. We have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle.

As far as I'm concerned it is too late!  The first stated that the shipment would leave on April 16.  When I purchase the camera, I did so because the add stated that if I wanted the camera by April 12, I needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes.  This I did.

Well, I'm not missing 2 more and Amazon is getting the camera back. The best part of this is that I don't even have the option of canceling the order because Amazon is and I quote, ""... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed.""  If you can't get the order out on time, you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet, try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost.

I was a diehard graco fan.  When my daughter was born 2002 the Graco Snugride was the top rated infant seat (I put a lot of stock into what consumer reports has to say).  The infant seat was great and we got it as part of the travel system.  I loved both the stroller and seat, and was very sad when she outgrew the seat around 1 years old.  I tried an Eddie Bauer convertible seat next and it was horrible, the straps always twisted and my daughter's head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep.  I quickly changed the Graco Comfortsport (the one with the overhead drop down bar) and she loved it.  It had more padding, her head rested on the side of the carseat instead of her chest and the straps never twisted.  It was easy to get in and out and not too heavy to lug around in airports.  When she outgrew that seat I decided to make the switch to Britax.  Although the Roundabout was rate #1 on CR I went with the Marathon because the only thing CR didn't like about it was the infant latch (which I wouldn't need as my child was 3yrs old) and it had a higher weight limit than the Roundabout.  I own a Honda Accord 4 door and my husband drives a 4 door Toyota Echo (tiny).  The seat fits perfectly well in both vehicles in the forward facing position.  The Toyota has latch and the Honda doesn't but in both cars it doesn't move.  Partly due to the fact that my husband is excellent at installing and partly due to the car seats weight.  It is quite heavy, and it can be a pain to haul around airports.  My husband usually just loosens the straps and wears it like a backpack through the airport.  My daughter loves it, (we have a girly print, not the granite) it has plenty of room for her, she never is uncomfortable sleeping in it (her head doesn't sit on her chest either), and though she's a very bright 4 year old she's never been able to get out of the seat.  I love the fact that she can be in it until she's 65lbs with the five point restraint and the straps never twist.  Britax also does thoughtful things like adding velcro on the sides of the seat to hold the straps in place when you're putting your child in and having a padded area under the clip so your child isn't burned by the hot plastic in the summer (or freezing in the winter).  I plan on staying with Britax from here on out	1
bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page, so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality.  but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one.  in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on, and in good lighting it is barely adequate.  wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card...should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer.  you get what you pay for	0
I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton.  I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product.  They are wonderful.  If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small.        	1
I only had it for a few hours and after that I knew I would be returning it. Its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. I should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. But honestly, I prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. It's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. You basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. This also is a pain for Mac users. It says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in ASF format. Now you can play it in VLC, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. It converts just fine, except without audio. I've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. So, Mac users, pick something else. It is being returned, for certain	0
my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.

This product works well with my Dr Brown's bottles.  There are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles.  Much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks.  I use a Sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it won't scratch the bottles, though.  The Sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	1
so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont.Then after a week it just stops working.dont get it, theres no flash whatsoeve	0
"This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.

I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.

It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.

It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.

The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.

The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.

The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.

It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.    

The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.

It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.

It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.

A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.  

The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.

This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.

This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.

This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.

This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.  This is snazzy, well designed, handy, lightweight, convenient, and offers everything we need"	1
"Hi, I bought this camera and installed the driver from both the CD and then the web.  It caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times.  The camera worked without interfacing with the computer, but, then, what's the point?  Also, the pictures and movies were VERY grainy and low quality.  The tech support when I had these problems was HORRIBLE.  They really didn't stand behind the product AT ALL and to me that's the most important thing!  Maybe I could have gotten it to work, but not without SOME input from Aiptek.  
I've never written one of these reviews before, but this really got to me.  Don't buy this camera is my advice. "	0
If anyone asked me what baby product I would have to have it would be this product!  I love it and it is very comfortable to use.  One negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well, so don't let your child use it because they could slip.  I would purchase it again and would give it as a gift	1
"I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:

1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..

2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.

3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.

As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices."	0
This product is good for your knees, however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping...other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste	1
It seems as if every time I want to use the camera, the battery is dead. I find that if I charge it and try to use it the next day, I should expect very much. I'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes, but I shouldn't have to do so	0
"Very convenient carseat, can be placed in the combi double stroller, which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into. (and I've searched a lot) The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo (whichI also have) but you can;t connect that one into the Aria twin, the peg perego side by side.
 The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage, and VERY soft with the foam insert. It's easy to get into the car with or without the base. Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out.  
Also, our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat, so it must be pretty comfortable"	1
This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again	0
I have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it! It could be used for a girl or boy. I have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything I liked and they seemed high in price, well then I found this one and it's fits perfect on a portable crib. And it's alot cuter than the picture! I really do like it. The only thing is I wish it had a dust ruffel :	1
I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.	0
"We have tried 3-4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children (now 4 yrs and a 10 month old).  This is a GREAT option for a gate.  Ours is solidly installed, it clicks shut automatically with an audible click (so after my 4 year old goes through, I don't have to worry about him leaving it open - it closes by itself AND I can hear the ""click"" that tells me it closed), and you don't have to drill holes in your woodwork/staircase to install this.

It is much easier to open, just as sturdy as the drill-in gates, and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried.  We love it for our house"	1
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven; this lens was everything I wanted and more.  Three weeks after receiving it we went to the Grand Canyon, and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance, clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus.  It's not my D70, which still works wth other lenses.  This one's going back to it's maker!  If they fix it, I'll revise this review	0
My son is just so excited about his Sponge Bob bed.  He climbs in and out every second thus showing how much he likes it.  I like it because it is low and no accidental falling off and hurting himself	1
Not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly, it is a complete downgrade. Panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the PV GS320 model,a MICROPHONE JACK! I currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time, since the 300 is discontinued I purchased the so called upgraded model. Now the only available model with MIC jack is the VDR 310, and I have heard DVD is quality on Camcorders is not what it should be. If you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a MIC, this camera is not for you	0
This bed was hard to put together but it was well worth the trouble. It is a great buy for the price. You can't go wrong if you have a little time and patience to put it together	1
"I've purchased seven items from Amazon in 2005, so I'm not a complete rookie. This item's ad title includes the word ""Battery"" in big, bold letters . I purchased this kit advertised with a ""Used Price"", but ""Condition: New"". The ad picture clearly shows a battery. I had looked at several ads and did not read the individual Seller's comment ""BATTERY MISSING"" in uppercase, though in regular font. To me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a ""comment"". That's my ""lesson learned"", but I still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. LESSON LEARNED: READ THE WHOLE AD FOR THE SPECIFIC SELLER, ESPECIALLY THE ""Seller's comments"""	0
Granted, it may not work for every single baby (haha) but I know a ton of women who SWEAR by this blanket.  It is the gift I give at every shower.  Don't second guess yourself about whether or not to get this brand over a less-expensive one - you won't regret it	1
This product link needs to be corrected, as the battery contained in the kit is NOT the same battery which is used in the DCR-DVD7.  Do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the DCR-DVD7 camera.	0
"Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual ""Swaddling"" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little ""getting used to"" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents. "	1
The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping	0
My son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver! When I wrap him in it, he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time. He can easily break out of the Swaddle Me, but not the Miracle Blanket. I am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends!!	1
"This camera looks cool. But it's so, so not cool.

The people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. This is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. EVER.

By the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. It ""clips"" on... but not for long. The camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. It's complelety unreadable. Even with a 150mb card I could only take a few short quality videos. You can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. And I'm talkin' LOW quality. Worse than any video you've seen online.

More problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. The controls and interface are not intuitive. You'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. Oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are HUUUUGE. They aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. I had the camera in my pocket and when I stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. They're obviously intended for Oompa-Loompas.

I'm sure I could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason.

Don't waste your time with this. You will be sorely disappointed. In fact, if I could give this product a rating of-10 stars I would do so. I'm so extremely disappointed with this camera"	0
I thought these were very good quality considering the price. I like them better than the one I bought at BRU that cost much more	1
I paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. The menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. A bummer of a christmas present	0
When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it... They gave us the Diaper Depot as well. I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table. It has lasted two kids before the one it's on now, so a total of three babies. I guess like anything if it's taken care of properly it won't break	1
"Received the DXG-506V yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. Many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. This is kind of like false advertising. This is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. Geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple � inch plastic mount on the bottom. As for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. You can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. That is pretty bad. The resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.

The best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in AVI, MOV or ASX format at different resolutions which is why I got it in the first place. It is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. It also has a lens cap. 

My advice to DXG is this. 
1.	Add a tripod mount.
2.	Move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that I can use an external microphone. That would be sweet.
3.	Improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. The optional settings do nothing to improve this. I tried them all.

Bottom line is that I would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. There are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use."	0
"Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course. 

Note:
We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's them"	1
"They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge. 

While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek.

This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS"	0
I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training.  I like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet.  She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty, it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training	1
"For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.

Not recommended"	0
"I have this seat for my 4 month old and I love it... Yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but I have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a Toyota Avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest... With my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car... Graco has made it so that I no longer have to do this. My son is nearly 20lbs already and had I been using your average infant seat I would have to buy him a new one already... Bravo to Graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits... Another perk is it has the canopy so the sun isn't in his eyes which I also wouldn't get if he were in a convertible car seat.

My one and only complaint is that the fabric isn't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but I just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine... This in itself isn't enough to make me trade this seat for another"	1
I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved.  We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned.  If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  What a pain!  Also, the picture quality is horrible.  I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak	0
My 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the Britax Boulevard and is loving it.  She looks comfortable in it, and I really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident.  I can really see her growing into it as well.  It is a little large for our Camry but there is still enough room for one other person (instead of 2) in the backseat	1
This is the worst camera I have ever owned in my life. I had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one! I have taken this camera on 2 vacations now, and both times I brought along my Olympus SLR film camera, and both times, the Olympus pictures are clearer, brighter and all but maybe 1 will work, with this stupid Sony Cybershot, I end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening, the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time, or in bright lighting. On the first vacation I went on with this camera, my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures, as did my Olympus, on the second vacation I returned from today as I write this, I just downloaded my pictures, and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad, the ones that came off my film camera are perfect! My sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her, and as I went through her pictures, same thing over 2/3's of them didn't work, I would have just assumed I'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my Sony that did not work, however hers didn't either, I would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem, however, I took a number of the exact same picture on this Sony as well as my Olympus (as a back up and thank god I did) and the pictures from the Olympus, as well as every other camera I have ever used, have come out fantastic, on this camera though, they come out horrible, so bad in fact that I'm embarrassed to show people! Believe me, if I hadn't gotten it free as a present I'd be writing a nasty letter to Sony, as it is though my next camera I'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment, therefore knows what they're doing. Sony makes great TV's and home entertainment systems, anything else I've bought from them, or known someone who has, has been junk, their camera, their car stereos, their computers! Sony should stick to TV's and Home Theater, it's what they're good at, camera's not so much, unless you're looking for something cheap that you'd only use in the day, even then I'd recommend a disposable, they even work better than this camera	0
"I got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter. I was concerned that it would be too large for my car (I have a Honda Civic), but it fit just fine. Rear-facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat, so if you have 2 kids, you would have to put the seats up further, but if you are short, that will likely not be an issue. I had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly -- he installed it in minutes and did NOT need any foam pieces to make it fit properly! It was a perfect fit on its own.

Pros: 
1. it is the best car seat you can get!
2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep
3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats
4. the seat is very well cushioned, soft fabric
5. fits fine a small car even rear facing (I have a Civic)
6. it's heavy so its not going anywhere!
7. works for up to 65 pounds, so we will get a lot of use out of the seat
8. she loves it!

Cons:
1. it is large/heavy (though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem)
2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child, but you need to pull straight out and not up
3. it is expensive

I highly recommend this seat (we have the Onyx fabric). It is large, heavy and expensive, but it is the best!! I had buyer's remorse for a few minutes, but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter. I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat! Very pleased with this seat! Also, please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician (Check with your local Children's Hospital). Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants. Something very easy to prevent"	1
we had this camera for about a year until on Thanksgiving Day while out of town it broke.  The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  I am looking into now buying the Canon powershot 6.	0
"Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a ""big girl"" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.

The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one.

This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints.

My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it"	1
"I have owned several digital cameras, and this is my current digital camera in hands. I would write a short review as a critical person with concentration ONLY on important things to watch for.
Pros
- Uses only 2 AA batteries.
- Battery life is very good.
- Small camera size. Easily fits into a pocket.
- Can set '+' flash level, which forces camera to make a stronger flash. I use it almost every time.
Cons
- Resolution. The images are not sharp in terms of that you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture. I would say, there is no much difference in quality between 4 MP and 50% (1 MP) scaled down version. The same problem exists in Sony DSC W1 camera.
- I had many problems with ""ON"" button. Sometimes camera refuses to turn on. It can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again. (It could be a defect in my camera only).
- Some camera parts are painted plastic, which can be scratched.
- Camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries (~several hours) or without them at all (10 minutes).
- Video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode, but eats flash space very quickly. Windows 2000 didn't have the right codec to view the file. I had to install it by myself.

I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.	1
"Bought the Samsung 363 from Amazon and it developed mechanical fault while I was test running. Making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable.
About 2 weeks later, i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again. Problem with the power system. paralysing it completely (all in less than 3 wks from purchase. Left it Plugged to charge for 2 days without difference

It's indeed a sad story. That would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder."	0
I have a climber!  She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months.  She was way too young for a bed.  We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep.  It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver	1
I bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the PC.  It worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the LCD or the viewfinder.  I could see other information on the LCD, such as the date, time, menu, but no image from the screen.  I called Samsung and that is where it is now for repairs.  A check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented.  I did try to install the software that came with the camera, but that did not go to well either.  I will retry when I get a working camera again. 	0
"AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS ""TRAPPED"", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY!"	1
This needs A LOT of light. I returned this do due the lighting/picture quality. The one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card-mpeg 4	0
I am surprised to read that people don't like this mirror. We have had it since our son was 1 mon. and we still use it at 7 mon. We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat. It has been great for road trips (our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store. We don't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy. We have never had trouble with it being too soft. I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well. Def. recommended.	1
The thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. Even those taken with a tripod. I am a pro photographer, and I would not recommend this camera. Yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...Seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images	0
What a great product. No tools, just click, click, click, and it's ready to use. The anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress. The frame is metal NOT plastic! I am very pleased with the quality, and the look. It was out of the box, and on the bed in about 10 minutes. :	1
"I bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing.
THe video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace...
Its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min"	0
"A great success. I love all Kiddapotamus products, that I bought so far because they are well-done, thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all, they are really very handy.

We went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself. Without that mat, we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out. The placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left. Best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit, eat and play - on our table. He was really happy about it.

After our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag.

I was really satisfied"	1
"We bought this camera two years ago.  We have loved using it, until last week.  The camera showed an ""E18"" error in the middle of a special event.  We researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  We're not sure how ours developed the E18 (never dropped or damaged.) Our camera has been rendered useless and Canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair"	0
I bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair.  It worked great and kept things cleaner.  Unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck. 	1
Please buy a different camera.  I have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras.  Under normal wear and tear, the Cannon SD400's LCD screen broke where other cameras I've owned have not.  I just purchased the Nikon S7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that I can hit it with no adverse affect.  If you do buy the SD400, set aside the $150 you'll likely need to replace the LCD	0
I have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table, and I like both for different reasons.  The disposable ones are sort of expensive, but very portable when I am flying and visiting relatives.  The Hippo one is great to grab and go around town, when I am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag.  I have had waiters thank me at many restaurants!  Just fold the mess right up and clean at home!  My son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it, and I don't want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs.  This hippo is really durable too, I have used this same mat for over 3 years, (I first got it for my daughter) and it still looks great	1
I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera	0
"I got this product b/c when we first put our daughter in the highchair when we went out to eat she immediately wanted to touch the table.  I was fine with it until I wiped the table off and was disgusted at what I saw.  The tables at most restaruants aren't always cleaned with clean rags.  
Now, as she's older and eating some puffs and other finger foods, it's great b/c I can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers!  
I keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it's dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty.
It's such a simple concept product, but so GREAT!
The only complaint I have is that sometimes it doesn't stick very well....."	1
I bought this camera to mainly use the Digital macro mode, it worked great for several months, now it will not lock focus, this camera is very frustrating, every picture that I take I have to edit to lighten the picture, I tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out, to no avail, I am a commercial real estate appraiser, so I have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera, and just about every one I had to lighten, now the Macro mode wont work, I will not buy another cannon product ever again!!	0
I have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it!!  The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs.  To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access.  The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other.  There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff.  There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag.  The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage.  Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly.  I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable!   	1
"I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused. 

Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.

Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me"	0
I agree with the above reviewers. This rug is large and very well made. Perfect in any little girl's room	1
Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.  The camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code E18.  I've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  Nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  Canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer! 	0
I have tried just about every diaper rash cream (desitin, balmex, mustela, vaseline, sprays, gold bond powder, generic brands, etc...), but this is the only brand that truly works.  The oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter's bum in usually one or two changes.  BEST PRODUCT	1
"Here's one more A95 to add to the ever increasing list of E18 failures.
Thanks to the horror stories from the other posters I'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. The camera is only about 2 years old... guess I'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits!
The camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. Hope you have better luck than me if you get one"	0
This stuff works wonders for my son's sensitive bum... and FAST!  We usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is GONE or nearly so.  It also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams.  It may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison, but I've found that I don't need to use as much, which makes that argument mute	1
"I got the dreaded ""E18"" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake"	0
We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately.  She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it.  The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me.  This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now.  It is easy to open, shut and lock.  I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though.  I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright.  The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.  	1
"I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.  

And then... 
There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.  

I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON."	0
Great buy.  My daughter loves this stroller.  I like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though.  Your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back.  I would recommend this stroller.  maneuver really well, I can do it with my 1 hand, fold one hand.  Great, great stroller.	1
"I've had this camera just over a year (figures) and it has gone completely bonkers on me.  Sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless.  You never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable.  Keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business, so it wasn't abused, dropped, thrown in the bottom of a purse, etc.  It was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total.

Frankly, I'm kind of glad it broke so that I have an excuse to replace it.  Here's why:

1.  Takes beautiful still shots, but forget about any kind of action.  It takes too long between shots to get good action.  It also blurs nearly all the action shots I've ever taken, regardless of what mode it's in.

2.  The red-eye is aweful.  It should do better.

I doubt that I'll ever buy another Canon"	0
Before my daughter was born, I knew I was determined to breastfeed her.  I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were.  Several people mentioned this nursing stool.  I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be, but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly, so I went ahead and bought it.  In the weeks prior to my daughter's birth, my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work.  After my baby was born, I set up a little nursing station in my living room, and I found the stool to be an essential item.  Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position.  I also used a nursing pillow, and between the pillow and the stool, the whole experience was actually very comfortable.  I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position.  I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies, and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby	1
This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0
This bib does it all and there are no complaints whatsoever! I used to go through 8-10 bibs every few days, but now this is the only bib I use every day, all day! Easy to wash, catches everything so there is little mess on or around my child and it's easy on, easy off!	1
Junk.  You will get a lens cap error in about a year or so, where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore	0
It is a very nice product, soft and easy.  But it was an ideal for my daughter's neck. She has neck rash and the plastic ring around the neck was not a good ideal for her	1
"I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.  It kept saying that the lens cap was on.  I am so frustrated and sad.  I spent a good chunk of money on this item and don't know what happened... still don't have a way of recording my daughter's milestones....

"This gate has some good points and just one negative.

Pros - good price, easy to operate. Mine are very easy on the batteries, I replace them about every 2 months. They are located on the kid's bedroom doorways, about 8' apart from each other. We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs, and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister's room when she wants some quiet time. 

For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both. So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other, then set up the second gate seperately. I have never had them malfunction following these steps.

Cons: 
I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door. I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough. It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back. We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this. But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems. It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood. I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down. The also should be a little taller IMO, and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open. Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed..a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed. This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it.

Overall, 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching. Good price though and it is put together well"	1
"I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.

It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.

Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. 

I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.

When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.

Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.

I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.

If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.

I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics. "	0
We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market. Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $66! The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install. This Evenflo Gate was put together, installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven't been able to budge it one inch. Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls. Great product at a bargain price - we're ordering three more	1
"I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.  

I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos.  I'll review the Cannon  once I've had it for a few months"	0
"A snap to install, my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate, it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again.

Forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house -- one remote will opena ll of them... pretty stupid design. :"	1
"This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output.  I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this.
Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.  And point and shoot is definately not an option.  I thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping.  I've taken over 200 pictures and I will not print any of them."	0
"We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters.  The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate.  This gate is well worth the money.  The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.  

With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!  I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone.  Service like that is not so common anymore.  Like I said, great concept and service"	1
"I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same.

"I have to say this is a better made one than some of the others. My mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her.

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
"I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out.

The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the ""must buy for mom"" list for the 2008 Christmas season.

I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible!  And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me.  Back to by big old Sony"	0
"I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first ""L"" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, & CA are much better. Build quality & feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try & get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens."	1
"the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. Compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users I purchased these camera's for. 

Also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly."	0
"I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.

Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore.

I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.

Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated ""in stock soon"".

Pros:
Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5.
Very fast lens with f/2
Very good bokeh (background blurring).
Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color.
Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s.
It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.


Cons:
No hard case.
No inexpensive.
Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait"	1
I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone	0
I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it	1
What a pile of junk.  Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  I can't believe they sell this thing.	0
The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost	1
I got for Christmas, it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on,,,stay away from this one!	0
"This is one of the four cameras, the only digital camera, I used to learn portrait photography.  The class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. I wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because I wanted an SLR film camera also.  I got the Canon Rebel Ti packed with two lenses. It made sense to me to purchase a Canon digital to interchange lenses. My original choice was the Canon Digital Rebel, however, in my  WEB search, I found the EOS 10D for $750 with no catch.  There were no required additional purchases scam when I called.  This allowed me to spend the extra money I would have spent on the camera on accessories.  

Since it's digital, I am not shy about trying out the features.     When I first got the camera, some of the photos were dark or very light. After tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means I don't get that anymore. 

The 10D is more camera than I need that I'm sure I will have it for a long time."	1
I was happy at first when I got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.

"I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is ""much better"" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded ""Canon."" It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want"	1
I've never ordered anything and been this disappointed.  I ordered two of these and both didn't work.  I contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it.  I tried contacting Ritz Camera where I purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund.  I am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support.  I will never buy another product from this company again. 	0
This is a good, affordable UV filter for protecting your expensive lenses.  I leave it on my lens all the time.  This particular filter (L-39 Sharp Cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses (&lt; 24mm focal length), because of its ultrathin profile, which prevents vignetting.  I have used regular filters on wide angle lenses, with very bad results.  Although this filter is NOT multi-coated, I have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures I've taken.  Multi-coated UV filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one, which I don't think is worthwhile.  All in all, I recommend this filter for Canon or non-Canon lenses	1
"My wife got this for me for Christmas.  I was thrilled and thought it was a great idea.  I charged the device and transferred pictures to it.  I work in technology, so I agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos, you have to delete them from the device, not the software.  Image quality is OK, but not good enough to be ""sharing"" with people.  And after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them, it got a bit old.

Other than looking at it ""straight-on"", nobody on either side of you can see the image.  It's back-lit, which is fine...but it doesn't help much.

Unfortunately, the battery didn't last all that long.  The device refused to charge after about two months, and eventually it died altogether.  The only way to make the unit work was to plug in the USB cable; the battery would not charge. So I contacted ""support"" and got a basic run-around, telling me that you ""shouldn't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours"" at a time, and that I could request an RMA to return it for replacement.  Warranty is no good, and it can't be returned.

I'm holding onto it because I'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop ""photocube"", so it can run off the USB cable.

But I agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly"	0
This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges  faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual	1
"This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called ""Smartparts"" is identical to one sold by ""Argus.""  Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  You buy this, you're on your own.  You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.

In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  Don't pay more.  Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.

I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light	1
"The battery does not hold up. After 10 months it would not work at all. I thought it was the battery. Emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable. I found one and changed it out myself. The unit was just dead. Warranty is 60 days.

I'm very happy with my Speedlite 580EX, is a new dimension for my photographic hobb	1
The idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful. I have it, have pictures on it, but never show it to anyone. Trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous. Easier to show a few pictures in my wallet	0
I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
"I purchased this for my wife for Valentine's Day. The installation went fine but I have two problems with the device. First, the software to do the picture transfers is awful. You can only select pictures on your computer to download - you can't see what photos are on the device in the software. In order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself. I checked the webpage for updated software - no joy. The crop feature is nice (and well used) but otherwise I feel like I am looking at a Windows 3.1 application. Second, the image quality on the device is very poor. I didn't have very high expectations, but this was lower than I expected. Reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens, maybe a bit worse. You can make out the picture, but not much detail at all. The advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea, it's the only way to get a decent picture.

Overall, I'm a little disapointed. But then, you get what you pay for.."	0
WOW!!!  This is my 4th Sony, I keep trading up and I am so impressed.  There is no delay on the shutter speed,  great pictures and enough special effects to be fun, but not enough that you need a PHD to operate	1
I was really disappointed in this product.  It worked great when I first got it.  But before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working.  It was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera.  Like I said, disappointed	0
"I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use.  And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen.

ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it."	1
"DOWNSIDE: 
1. I'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. The camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. I switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. On top of that I now have a memory card with photos on it that I can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that.
2. Not good with indoors pictures ESPECIALLY if you try the ""night"" mode. If you use that mode, even with a tripod, keep your subjects to still-lifes, only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest, they will at best be blurry, at worst they will look like double exposures.
3. Indoors pictures set at normal mode, with or without flash, are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera.

UPSIDE:
1. Through its USB cable, it booted right into Apple's iPhoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that I took a breeze.
2. Outdoors, with plenty of sunlight, gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. Kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability, given the price.
3. We won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now I have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card"	0
"This, in my very humble opinion, is the most useful, the sharpest, and just about anything else good you can think of say, best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lightning fast and that's what you want when the light is low.

My gal pal Sara and I have often wandered the Caribbean islands in the dawn's early light, as she is into shooting old homes. She particularly likes the gingerbread homes in Marigot, on the French side of St. Martin. I swear she must have them all on her hard drive. It's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion, feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light.

She just loves it and since I love her, I gotta love it too. Seriously though, I've used the lense quite a bit myself and it's a keeper if ever there was one. You just go wrong with a Canon ""L"" lense, no siree.

I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006	0
"When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good ""business"" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them"	1

"I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby.  The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard.  I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them.  This is just right for my purposes.

The remote is also better for taking pics of people.  It is much better than a timer in my opinion since I can move people in and out easier and more efficiently, taking pictures more quickly.  This gives me so much more control than using a timer."	1

"I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera.
The lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers.
For those individuals who are on the fence about this product I tout it to all I have spoken to. It turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot, it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash.
The built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. The delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package"	1
I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one.  I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.

I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera	0

"I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30"" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called ""Purchase Assurance"" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!  

The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.  
The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore. "	0
I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?	1

I bought a Fujifilm Finepix F460 digital camera for $299.99. 

Nov06 
Camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating 
bright/dark horizonal strips across them. 

Jan07 
I sent the camera in to Fujifilm's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires. 

Jan07 
The service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 (I spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if I accepted). 

Feb07 
I contacted the service center and stated that I think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse. And that I don't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired. The service rep, named Christina, asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do. I complied.

Fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that I did not reply to the estimate.

The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one!	0
"I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft.

This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups.  The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image.  The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m.  This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.  Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element.

Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention.  I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. 

The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. 

This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity. 

Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations.  Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens.

The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm.  The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens.  The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations.  The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. 

PROS: 
Incredible clarity and sharpness 
Quiet and quick auto-focus 
Features add creative versatility 
Dual IS system 

CONS: 
Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses"	1
This product didn't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit; the sound from the ECM-HGZ1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself. I wish I had not bought it	0
"Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, ""Mr Magoo"" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good. 

I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user.

For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century.

(Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)"	1
"We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations.
To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.  
I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.  
I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.  

I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.  

Overall, I am stuck.  If I record something interesting I will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (The camera shots great video"	0
This lens works really fast. It is a great lens. Captures the color in real depth and detail with my Canon 20D camera	1
I agree with the previous reviewer. Buying, attaching, and using this microphone is a waste of time and effort. Save your money and get a good microphone, unless you want your sound track to sound like someone mumbling into a tin can	0
I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
"I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality.  At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.  

Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.  

I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.  I know now that I should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker.  I thought I'd get more use this route"	0
For the money, you absolutely can't beat this lens.  It's very fast and sharp.  Not fast to focus, but what do you expect at $70?  I have four lenses , some costing 4x's as much as this one...yet I use this one the most.  Anyone looking to step up from the kit lens, or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens	1
"Hi,

I have had the VDR-D300 for about 6 months now.  I have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min.  The camcorder constantly locks up, usually after about 10 min.  This is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm.  Several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works.  I must have a faulty unit.  I'm investigating repair.  The unit has a great lens, camera, and video image, but my unit is not stable at all"	0
Very happy with the lens, and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
Amazon picture shows an original Japanese-produced NP-40 with 3.7V and 710mAh (just like the one I got with my F810). What I got was a Fujifilm-branded Chinese-produced NP-40 with 3.6V and 750 mAh. YES, IT WORKS, but it's just obviously cheaper. Skepticism is a virtue	0
This is a great lens for star fields. It is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest. The focus was sharp to the corners without coma. See my photo of a portion the Milky Way. This was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a Rebel XT on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table	1
This product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  This little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). I initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128MB card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. A firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but I could never get the file to load into the frame. Another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  It would have been nice to hear a RANDOM music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. Definitely NOT worth the price. Shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback	0
I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed	1
I bought this because it was 50% off. I can't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer. I guess for background noise, it would be good but as a photo viewer, it's not. Small screen + low resolution = poor viewer	0
I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
"-- Update 4/23/2007 - The vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame, and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below. --

Picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results. Appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished, but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the LCD display mars the effect somewhat.

At 5.6 inches, this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close. The images are smaller than a 4x6 print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand. I found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away. On an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better. The size of the LCD also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular, true of any frame in this category. 

My biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware (~3/2007), it will only display up to about 250 pictures. I expected that what ever was on the memory card I inserted would be displayed.

Overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos.  I am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer's product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it"	0
"Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering. 

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood.  Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Reduces lens flare problems 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens"	1

I love my Nikon Coolpix 5900 however, the lens failed in less than one year. Service took 6 weeks to repair. The lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair.

This is an excellent battery that powers my Canon 5D camera very well. Although I haven't tested it against the spec for how many shots I can get from it, I've been very impressed with the longevity of it's charge	1
"I bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  I sent it into Nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. The repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22.

I am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  Battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time I had it. 

For this reason I would never buy another Nikon product again.  Next digital camera will charge without removing battery.  

Camera takes GREAT pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty.

This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies.  The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense.  Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories.  I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment.  The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge!  The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map.  The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it.  The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag.  Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything.  Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable	1
"I was very disappointed in Nikon's service.  This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile.  When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't!  I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke.  To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.  

I will NEVER by a Nikon product again.  If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it."	0
"The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.

My digital Rebel XT fits with the Canon Battery grip and my macro lens attached, however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. 

My Canon Speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. The lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. 

I bought a regular Lowepro camera bag, but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. This bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. 

If you search Google images for the Lowepro Slingshot 200 you will see what I mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.

I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  We had to send the unit back.  I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item. 	0
"This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. "	1
I won this camera in a contest and now I'm kinda wishing I never had.  Practically everything I've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another.  From the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on, to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations, to the camera recording glitches in the audio when I capture onto my computer.  I know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but I really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a Canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems	0
This UV filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands	1
this is the worst camcorder i've ever owned.the picture quality is the worst.i can't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance.if i move a little,or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus.i haven't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet. i recommend panasonic,it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear.it's my fault i didn't do my research before i bought this	0
"My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light.

I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing.

I was not disappointed.

The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed.

Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool"	1
"The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price"	0
Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.	1
You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.	0
Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible.  If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition.  The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies.  You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice	1
"Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)

Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories"	0
"I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only ""40% better"".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage"	1
"I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.

I was able to use the Canon EF 1.4X II Extender for some nature photography recently in Wyoming.  I shot elk in low light conditions so I was shooting pretty much wide open.  The extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all.  You could see the hairs on the animals heads.  It's fantastic	1
Instead of this pick up a Plextor convertor box.  It takes the output of the camcorder (composite/RCA or S-Video) and compresses that to mpeg-2 (DVD) or mpeg-4 (or DivX) and includes software which easily burns that to DVD or CD (mpeg-1 or mini DVD).  Look for Plextor's M402U box.  Unless you really want to deal with 3.125 MB of data per second (25 Mbps), or about 180 MB per minute, or about 11 GB per hour through the firewire link, get the M402U.  Your options will be greatly expanded, and you won't tell the difference by looking	0
"This is a good tool, does the job well, and serves the purpose, but is a little overpriced and Canon keeps changing connectors, forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer.

If you are willing to pay for it, it's a good product."	1
I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot	0
I already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my EFS 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing. Well, Canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the LP1116. This pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens. The cord is strong and silky and doesn't open accidently the way a silky cord would. Obviously we can't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand. The moment I buy another lens, I shall have to buy its matching pouch	1
I bought my Kodak V570 less than a year ago. At first the only annoyance I had was the fact that I had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in MOV format that made it diffcult to edit. But a few months ago, the focus refused to work properly. In wide angle, it was fine but when I zoomed in, the image was unacceptably blur. I tried every setting, finally gave up and called Kodak service. I was asked to mail the camera to Sydney from Melbourne where I live. A few weeks later, the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. Since I still could not take acceptable pictures, I contacted them again. This time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. I did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. But the pictures were taken in broad daylight. When I disagreed with the logic of the comment, I was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. But the number they gave me was a fax number. Using my resources, I got in touch with technical service by phone. This time I was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright, it's probably due to shaky hands! It's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. It is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent India trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. Now I have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. There is no way I will ever buy another Kodak again. I can recommend it only to my worst enemies. I have now to, again, send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far, I am not holding my breath for answers. Still want to buy a Kodak? Go ahead but don't say I did not warn you. By the way, my other camera is a Casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not	0
It's good as my title says, however, I found one con about it is there is no place I can put a string on it so that I have to put it in my pocket when I take it off	1
"I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera. It takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. It is quite compact and has a nice screen. The software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface.

Why 2 stars? Ok here's the bad stuff:

1) In the first shipment I got, the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. The images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. The ultra-wide images were fine. I attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. The second V570 I got from Amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. So, I don't think it is just a random problem. There appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that I would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. My V570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and I use a Casio Exilim EX-Z70. 

2) The stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. You have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. Also, since you have to charge the battery in the camera, you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. For comparison, my new Casio EX-Z70 has a USB cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. So, if one battery is dead I can leave it behind in the charger while I take pictures with the spare.

3) The movies that you take with this camera are stored in MOV format instead of AVI or MPEG. While it does play in most PCs if you have installed Quicktime, it is not supported by my streaming media player (D-Link DSM-320RD) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/DVD creator SW I use (Sonic MyDVD). I can't say how widely MOV is supported compared to AVI and MPEG, but that format created problems for me.

So, I applaud Kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. But I think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations"	0
I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap.  This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens	1
"The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price"	0
"Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade.

I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon). 

Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance.

To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through"	1
You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.	0
"This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera. 

I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing. 

The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since.

PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap.

"Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

The power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself.  You wouldn't get that from the picture.  Too bad, other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger. 	0
Very good rechargable battery pack.Holds charge for a long time even if camera is not used much. Capable of taking many shots with plenty of review time. Very pleased with it	1
The quality of the pictures are nice WHEN they will actually print.  Unless you use the printer with your camera ON the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work.  If you decide to crop the picture on your PC and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work!  I have had it for sometime now and I have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing. 	0
I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time	1
This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works.  It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works.  The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink.  I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time.  Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap.  I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine.  This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!!	0
"If you've found these reviews, you already know this lens is one of the best Canon products out there. I did not bite on the IS version, and I have not found myself ever wishing I did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations.

I don't think it's weight is that big a deal. I really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. It can feel a bit heavy but I don't mind, and neither will you when you see the results later on.

I've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. In my mind, I could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range, which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography, considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much, much more expensive. The lens works basically just as fast and sharp, in my opinion, with the 1.4 at f/4, although some may debate this. Flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro.

If you can swing the price, enjoy it! My advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products, although I found most everyone agreed, this is one of the finest lens around. It's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are"	1
"Terrible product.  Printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  I've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  Even though I have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which I have had less than a year, Kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and I need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  A new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  I told Kodak support I would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. I further notified Kodak that I would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill.

Also, I've heard that the recommended fix (which does not work, by the way), unplugging the unit to reset, will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely.  With the cost of paper and cartridges, this last insult makes this printer one to avoid.  1 star because when it does print the prints look good, but, man, the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price.  Rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public.  Total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product. "	0

Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera	0
"my cousin's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots (I've been pretty active in this area for some time, just now starting to go full digital), and I've used the f/2.8L about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses I've used. period. shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots, as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots (of crowds, the freeway at night, etc). when shooting action shots, the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing, but it can be removed easily enough.

I personally just purchased the f/4.0L, which, coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20D, should do nicely, but I still rate the 2.8 high up on my list"	1

I made mistake getting such a big & bulky case for small MiniDV Sony camcorder HC26. This case can take any big size old camcorders (like old Sony Hi8), so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice	0
"I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me. 
I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens. 
I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens.
I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no ""L"" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did. 
In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase. "	1
"The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.

The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.

The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer."	0

"Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they ""...won't bother fixing it again..."" and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract"	0
"I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety & Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens.

Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation.

But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second.

With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air.

With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting.

It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage.

For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod?

The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient.

Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted.

I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process.

Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious.

Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about ""pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash."	1
...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started.

I recently purchased this for use with my 550EX. If you use alot of flash for event photography, you will want this in your kit. It is expensive, but I think it is worth every penny. It will keep you from changing AAs in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant. You can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure. You can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt. Mounting on my 20D was just not comfortable. It gets in the way of the hand-grip	1

After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware.	0

Ever wondering why Dell, HP etc all recall Sony battery for laptop, but Sony did not recall their own laptop battery? Sony will never fix their own problem. We the customer have to pay for their mistake. 	0
This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)	1
I bought this in August 2005, when the original battery that came with my Nikon Coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  On the page I ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine Nikon battery, however, when I received it, it was not.  It was made in Taiwan, and does not have the Nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as I remember).  This battery has never held a charge well.  It's about as bad as the original battery is now, and I've only had it a few months.  Maybe I just got a lemon--but I'd recommend you buy a genuine Nikon, if you can find one	0
"Many great things have already been said about this lens, and I will support them!

My copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70L) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest German manufacturers), great color, very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the ""best of breed"" ultra wide angle), and impressive contrast. Surprisingly, the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount, damped rings, and no jiggles or rattles.

If I were forced to offer a (slight) negative, it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat ""marbly""...However, when shooting a subject with an OOF area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame, then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;)

"I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.

"I bought this camera for myself during Christmas 2004.

It was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--I don't trust digital cameras for family photos.

The Kodak CX7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp.

The flaw in this camera didn't appear until I pulled it out of the drawer some months later. The camera wouldn't turn on. I checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. I eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked.

The next time I took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. And the time after that.

At first, I thought the CX7300 was eating the batteries. But eventually I came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. It won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries.

The Kodak batteries that came with the CX7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong.

I contacted Kodak about this flaw. They wanted to talk about what kind of batteries I'm using--Kodak--or the option of my purchasing a Camera Dock and some rechargeable batteries. A solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent.

I thought that buying an optional AC Adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. Surprise, surprise, the CX7300 is one of the few digital cameras Kodak makes that doesn't take one.

So, now that I'm way past warranty, what do I do with it?

It is so different than the standard kit lens (18-55). You won't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens"	1
I bougt this camera and a Olymus camera, both in the same price range, the Kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. Avoid this at all cost the Olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use	0
If you don't need the speed or can't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens or both, then this lens may be the right one for you. It took Nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens, but this time they finally got it right. Without a doubt, this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits (The only lens which is optically better is Nikon's legendary 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens, and its close optical twin, the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor.). Since the 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens doesn't have an autofocus version, then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of Nikon autofocus SLR cameras. Regardless, this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution	1
My camera has broken in less than one year of owning it.  Because I received it as a gift I don't have the proof of purchase so Kodak will not fix my camera for no cost.  What a lemon the CX7300 is.  First of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture.  What's broken?  I can take one picture before the batteries go dead.  I change the batteries, one picture.  Change the batteries again, one picture	0
This is original equipment battery charger manufactered by Canon. The performance of the charger is excellent as are most Canon products. The price paid was comparible to non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites. The item was recieved in original packaging, 3 days after placing the order, was new (not reconditioned with a new appearance). I am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced, from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping	1
"I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.
-first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.
-It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken.
-It eats up batteries like crazy
-It takes forever to turn on
-If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight
-The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home
-It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice."	0
Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras.  Seems to charge in about the same time.  Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost)	1
I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	0
"I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.  
I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal.
Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)  "	1
I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck	0
"I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static ""Warhammer models"" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were ""too long"" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.

The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.

As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in ""startled"" subjects and missed shots.

The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well"	1
"I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.

These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.

For the price, these can't be beat"	0
This is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier Canon Digital Elph that I lost several years ago. The 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. In fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (I purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). Although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have, you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. The Canon SD500 is a great little camera	1
"I am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible. I took about 400 shots with my Digital Rebel XT and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that I immediately returned it / got a refund. 

In all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus. In many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it's entire range. Since most of my photography is of animals I simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots.

I tested the autofocus against my Canon 18-55 EF-s (packaged with the Rebel XT) and a Canon 75-300 EF. In every instance where the Tamron could not focus the Canon lenses had no problem! When the Tamron would focus I found the pictures were not as sharp as my Canon lenses. Again I'm far from an expert however I was only printing 4x6 photos.

I replaced the Tamron with a Quantaray(Sigma) 55-200 DC which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality(for amatuers..) 

Bottom line.. It was hard to part with the Tamron because I was really enthused about the zoom range however I would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't. I have read many reviews with the same problem noted. Tamron needs to get thier act together"	0
Holds all my lenses, camera body, remote, card reader, etc... with room to spare. Compares to bags costing 3 times more.	1
I loved this camera when I received it and used it a couple of times. Then, it just stopped working. I have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great. Maybe this was just a bad egg. Good camera, but 2 months of use for the money wasn't good	0
"Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid conical two inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 85 f/1.8 USM EF, 100 f/2.0 USM EF, 135 f/2.8 USM EF, 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM EF lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering.  

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len"	1

"I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption.

I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep).

Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)"	1
"I originally purchased the Samsung DUOCAM SCD6040.  It fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  The video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  Though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  The repaired camera came back broken.  I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a ""lemon"" and they sent me the SCD6550.  Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.  I cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  It is not under warranty.  I can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  They must use cheap parts.  PLEASE save yourself the headache and chose another brand. "	0
"The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.  

The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries.  AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge.  AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities.  

I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines.  As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh.  I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages.  Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is.  

The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time. "	1
"I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. ""You get what you pay for""  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much"	0
I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention & then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest & beat out anything I could find in the local stores.

"I have many pet peaves about this camera.

a) the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark----don't try to record indoors

b) didn't fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button. NOT GOOD

c) didn't start up fast enough---I always missed the shot

d) the camera photos aren't of good quality

e) microphone not that great---you couldn't even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera.

f) if your laptop is over 3 years old, even if you've got Windows XP, don't expect the software to be compatible.

g) the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger. I'd lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out. I felt like I had to just manually zoom----ie. walk up closer to the subject

I honestly say stay away from the Samsung's and the Sony's aren't much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories, ie. only Sony products are compatible with the camcorder.

I finally bought a JVC and they are awesome----the take more light in, better acoustical recording, better zoom function, quicker start up, and lighter. You can even buy the cheapest model (which is pretty much what I've got) and the picture is great! My parents commented on how they thought I must have a camera like the News reporters, as it's the same quality"	0
Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.	1
"To add on to the previous reviewers, I was very disappointed with this camera's performance.  I compared the ""5 megapixel"" photos with photos taken with my Canon, PowerShot G3 (4megapixels), and the SCD6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills.  The camera itself also seemed flimsy.  The idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive.  But another attractive concept, Canon's Elura50, offered a camcorder with a compact design.  In the end, however, it broke down only after a year and a half.  For a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan (cf. reviews for Elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems).  This camera seemed less durable than the Elura50 as I maneuvered the various parts and dials.  Of course, I am returning the camera before it can prove its durability.  Nevertheless, maybe the folks at CNet can stake their money on it.  Lastly, I should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed.  I found that I had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button.  This definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments.

Again, this camera is a great idea.  But, I suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording.  This one is on the right track, but, still so far from accomplishing a quality product."	0
I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.	1
I would agree with the other review.  The indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable.  I will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another	0
"This lens has gotten some bad reviews, I think, partly because it is starting to show it's age.  This was the first USM IS lens, and the technology has REALLY grown since then.  If Canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 USM IS lens, man, it would blow everything away.  

That being said, yes, this lens IS a little slow to focus.  But, if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games, you should be okay.  It also could use an extra stop (or two, or three!) because when you are handholding, you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. 

All of this aside, I really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens.  It lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for.  If you have asteady hand and plently of availible light, you can get some really nice shots.  If you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod.  The IS of lens works... pretty good, but I have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. 

All in all, its a good starter telephoto lens, especially for digital SLRS since it really extends the zoom on those.  Its great for the price, and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon L beauties, just sell it"	1
"The SCD6550 is a great idea, but just doesn't preform as I had hoped.  I was looking for one camera to take on vacation, replacing carrying a 2 year old Sony MiniDV and a 5 MP Sony CyberShot.  My Sony takes 1 MP stills, has excellent video, but @ 1MP, the stills are not nearly print worthy.  This camera is actually smaller and lighter than my Sony.

The 5MP still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside.  Shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the Sony CyberShot.  

Digital video is this unit's short coming.  I did identical shots inside and outside with the Sony and Samsung.  The Samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality.  Inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable.  Outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the Sony.  I took it back, will keep the Sony's and hope that Sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 MP model soon"	0
"I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like ""great lens for the money"". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B&H, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon.."	1
"These are NOT pioneer boxes.  These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's.  Do not buy these.

Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer.  But then their own website also has named them Pioneer.  Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  It is my honest opinion. "	0

"I have to agree with the other reviews of this scope.  I purchased this scope as a Christmas gift.  When I opened it, the equatorial mount (the basis for the ENTIRE scope) was broken.  I contacted Celestron and was promised another part for it, which never arrived.  I contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me.  It DIDN'T FIT.  Finally, I was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope.  The equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah!  Too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and I could not assemble this one. I even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support (who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived) and all I got was a bunch of excuses.
I finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one ENTIRE telescope.  It's February and I just now have a product that works.  (I haven't had time to try it though!)  Celestron offered no refunds for this telescope, so buyer beware.  If they are not willing to satisfy customers, your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells. Good luck"	0
"The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.

"First off, many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....I cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the TWO that were sent to me were BROKEN!

I ordered well before Christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from Santa Claus.  My husband opened the telescope up late Christmas Eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the Christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken.  The 2 mounting screws were  bent, very bent.  This puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child.

After A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT with Amazon's customer service (from another country!) they sent a replacement...to the WRONG ADDRESS!!  (long story that I will not bore you with.)

When the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what?  They same screws were again bent.  The box on the outside was not damaged, but something is not working for them.

I am so disapointed with them.  This was the first time I had purchased something this big from Amazon.  I have mainly done music and movies, small stuff. 

After this experience I will NO LONGER buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage.  It's just not worth the headache and problems, not to mention DISAPOINTMENT, to my son.  

I would proceed with caution when ordering this item from Amazon.  If you get a broken one...you just might be receiving the 2 I have had to return"	0
"I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a ""wonderful"" new feature like ""low light or non-shake."" This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description..."	1
"This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.

The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. 

The finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  And don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.  

I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress na�ve buyers with its complex ""scientific"" appearance.  

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6"" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get  you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended	1
"This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

3.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

It is extremely easy to use.  Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures.  Great for action shots as well.  Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in	1
My ownership of this camera was brief.  First, you must know I love Nikon.  I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700.  They have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  I thought my experience with this model would be similar.  NOT!~  From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  What a dissappointment!  I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera.  I suppose it is just what it is.  If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows?  Anyway,  that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800	0
Excellent product, easy to use, great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork.  I can't wait to experiment with it	1
Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!	0
"When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. 

I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70).  I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever.

I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting,  portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera.

I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the ""Magic Lantern Guides"" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography.   "	1
"So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.
But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!"	0
"I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date.  Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings.

However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.
 
Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared.  

Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set.  But for now I content on using the camera the old fashioned way"	1
I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP	0
Other than the months of waiting for Nikon to deliver them to Amazon for shipping, the battery itself in a good deal.  They work well, charge up easy and hold their charge nicely.  Priced well, they cost less than the same type battery than Canon or Sony.  I bought them for a D80 and the older En-EL3a would not fit.  Of course I had 10 of the older batteries for my D70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the D80.  Basically the same size and shape, but keyed differently.  I was also surprised to find the 3e WOULD fit in the D70s, meaning they are backward compatable.	1
I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.	0
"This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200.  So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery.

This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate.  This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up.  This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard.  Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine)"	1
I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together	0
"I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D ""exposing"" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. 

The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers."	1
On reciept of the tripod, I found it wrapped and packed (on the outside)in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product.  When I opened the box, I found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box.  There was minimal packing around the tripod itself, mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching, and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around.  I have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping.  Also, if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company, instructions are not part of their package	0
"There are no professionals or would-be professional  photographers in our house.  Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf...

My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots.

This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range.

We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it.

I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted"	1

This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product	1
"I own the Olympus FE-100 Digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). I switched to Energizer Batteries and bought an Energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. It's not a quick charger like this one, but I say for less than half the investment, I've got a charger that does the job. I would NOT spend this kind of money on a charger. So I say, if you're part of the ""gotta have it now"" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. Otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money"	0

"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).

However, I do have a few things to complain about...

First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.

Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.

The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.

The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.

These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. "	1
"I ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken.

The assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic.    I asked for an RMA order via E-Mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.'

Being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with I tried repair it myself.  Where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.  

Even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all."	0
"Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile"	1
"The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me...""Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally""  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  ""That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens""  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck"	0
I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots.   	1

As for this lens, it is incredible. Wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background (good bokeh). AF is very fast. This lens is extremely good and will still AF when used with the 1.4x converter. (AF works up to f5.6."	1

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.	1

"When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good ""business"" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them"	1

"I purchased, through work, the PowerShot S70 in July of 2005.  I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!

The flash and door problem occurred while I was in Yosemite NP, so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning.  

Now, the warranty is expired and I hold my breath every time I slide the lens door open.  I have no faith in the Canon S70 and have lost a lot faith in Canon products as a whole.

The only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks, which I thought was fast for warranty work"	0

"I have had this bag for a year and recommend it.  I use it all the time.  It's a great walkaround bag.

My only error was getting the 100 - I should have gone with the 200, and plan to do so.  I like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room.  I'd also found that I need a little more room for non-camera things.

A word on the all-weather cover - a great feature.  A few weeks ago I was in Bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away.

I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it	0
"I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably. 

Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses.

I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag"	1
I just got this printer dock with a camera, and the printer feature is a real pain!  The paper will almost never feed no matter what I've tried.  When it does feed, it ends up jamming.  I only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone.  I'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	0
Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.   	1
I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and haven't even gotten to try it out yet--the print cartridge that came with it didn't work.  I ordered another and inserted it and it still doesn't work. It constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced.  Lots of time and money involved in this mess---stick with HP!	0
"This is an excellent device. Quick respond with my D80.
I use it to take the family pictures that include me.

"Here's the Good News: 
I have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and I have found the Z1 to be my favorite.  The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color.  My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good.  The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily.  Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.

Here's the Bad News:
Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible.  Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.  

Summary:
Great camera as long as it doesn't break.  It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it"	0
"I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it.
I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her."	1
"I bought the camera in May of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  He loved the style and compactness.

He experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  Unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or I might have been able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Contacting Fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. Their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (LONG WAITS).  They have had the toy camera (AS THIS IS BEING WRITTEN)for over a week and when I called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera ""hasn't been diagnosed yet"".  I expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit Fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  I have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  I might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.

If you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  If it ever requires repairs, you might feel as I that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  Save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  You may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  I bought it in May of 2006....I feel like I lost it in July of 2006.

IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THE Z1 LESS THEN 1 STAR, I WOULD HAVE.  THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES!   !&%$$##444EN FUJIFIL"	0
"If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one"	1
Bought this camera for my wife.  Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  Fuji customer relations is sub-par.  Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future	0
"I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the
over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a ""universal"" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)"	1
"I have two 8"" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!!

"I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings.

The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so.

I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years.

Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have.

On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing.

At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you"	1
"The battery which ""popped up"" with my camera order does NOT match the camera.  Thus I am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery.  I was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so I had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived. "	0
"After way too much time infront of a PC reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn I was sick of it), this D80 is what I chose. Bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip West. After draging it everywhere I has not let me down. For the price its perfect. I'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) At work I have a Rebel Xt I bought last year as I need its compact casing. My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). I didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. I got a great deal for the same price at Cameraland in New Hampshire for the D80 and the  (D70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. Fab. Now need to save up and wait for the release of the  80-300 VR lens thats coming out. Would love the 80-400 Vr but its 3 times the price.
My hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock, at a price I wanted to pay, the set up I wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in NYC).It really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. I was surprised. Many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. It was wierd. Parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either.    
Anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. I hope it takes many great pictures for you."	1
Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review	0
"First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with ""snapshots"".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than ""point and shoot"" snap shots"	1
My frame freezes after displaying a few pictures. The remote doesn't work. There is no website for contact or support	0
I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years	1
This is absolutely the worse digital device I have ever owned.  The manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  I try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  I can't download photos from my Mac.  If your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.	0
This camera does all that Canon says it does.  Fantastic pictures.  Great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use.  I did a lot of research before buying, and I could not be happier with the Canon G6	1
"If you want to load directly from your camera's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card.  There is no ""copy all"" function.

Loading information from a computer didn't work.  The USB connection was not recognized by Windows XP and I couldn't find any drivers on the Web.

A setup CD would be a nice addition.

BTW the screen was not as large as one might think.  It is very wide but not tall and it crops the top & bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people"	0
"I am certainly happy I bought this filter kit. For a starting photographer, the price was right, and I have not noticed any quality issues. The UV filter stays on a lens at all times, as it's cheaper to replace the filter, than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. 

The light polarizer is very handy, and also works very well, cutting down greatly on glare.

I have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. 

The filter case is a nice extra, it fits right in my camera bag, and is out of the way untill I need it"	1
I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do	0
"This is one of the best bargains that i've seen, ""essentially"" you get 3 filters for the price of one.  The image quality with these filters is great, the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out, that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power.  Aside from the 812 the UV protector is basically a clear protective filter.  While it obviously has advantages over clear glass, I tend not to think of it as any different.  This too is a great filter which I use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur.  Finally included is the circular polarizer. This filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). This lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again.  It also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large ""reflective"" man-made things. So things sound great so far, but now to why I only give this item 4 stars.  While Tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters, they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation.  In my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass.  While it was didn't hurt image quality, with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter, I none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality.  Seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to Tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do, but only after I send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances).  Instead Amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again, and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set.  The second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition I traded just the 812.  I havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. The only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. While I recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally I have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. A quick way to check to see if your CP is working correctly is to hold it, thread facing yourself, and look at an LCD monitor or TV and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). I still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what I do now, chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. Amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping"	1
"I received Pandigital 7"" Photo Frame (DPF70-2) as a Christmas gift and haven't been able to get the SD Card slot to function. When connecting to the PC via USB cable it tells me the removable device needs to be formatted.  Windows attempts to format the card and fails.  I'm able to format the card with a USB Card Reader and copy pictures to the SD card OK.  When I insert the SD Card into the Photo Frame is doesn't display any of the pictures, just a blue frame around the picture location.

I contacted PanDigital Tech Support via 800# and never received a call back so I sent them an email.  I received email response back after several days.  They had me try several things to resolve the issue; this troubleshooting process went on for more than week to no avail. They eventually acknowledged the Photo Frame appeared defective, When I asked to exchange the Photo Frame (taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site), they told me to return it to the store it was purchased.

I do not consider this very good customer service; I would not recommend this product."	0
Excellent product.Works as expected. Like all lens hoods though pricey	1
"Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation.

The Good: 
* Screen is bright, images look great
* Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen. 
* Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue.

The bad: 
My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!  

I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12"" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price.

Some details:
* Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the ""setup"" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global
* Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen.
* Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this ""feature"" off.
* The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change.
* No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily 
get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system.
* Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens"	0

"Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera.  I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby.  This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket.  This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking.  The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode. 
I hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not.    "	1
I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products	0
"I searched and researched the lens to purchase with my Canon Rebel XTI for weeks because I knew that I did not want the kit lens. I also did not have the money to spend on a 5, 6, or $700 dollar lens. In the end after reading countless reviews, ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion, this lens looked to be the best value. For the money I really don't think that you can beat this lens. It focuses quickly, it is really quiet while doing it, and it is sharp enough for the money. Plus it has full time manual focus, which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range. The only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the Rebel XTI, but I would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image. In summary I would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who doesn't have the money to buy an ""L"" series lens. It is really a great value"	1

"Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: ""that is it, nothing to do on it!"" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

I just bought a digital rebel about a month ago.  Love the camera, my old 380EX speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the Rebel. This flash does the job for the Rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once I grab that item.  Another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash, is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital Rebel lacks.  When this flash is mounted on your digital rebel, you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash.  The Rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550EX to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs.  The flash has tons of features that most of us might never use, but as a advanced amateur I'm glad they're there so I can play with that if I should choose to try out some fancy stuff.  The wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420EX, 550EX or 580EX to use that. I like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head, it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than I've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. This unit is a HONKER--really big, and, no lightweight either.  Get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you.  What's the difference between this and the 580EX? The 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes, for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. All of the newer EOS camera bodies are fully supported by this unit, it also works on older EOS bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff.  I like this flash it covers well, cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use.  When you get yours don't lose that book, Canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere I can find and I've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one	1

This is one fantastic flash.  I had it on my Canon A2e for four years, and was ambivilent, but if you match this lens with one of Canon's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550EX's features, you have an awesome, powerful, flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
I bought two one time, but there was no vedio on LCD as opened for both! They could not recorded vedio but audio only. It seemed that they hadn't CCD at all! I had to mail them back to repare just the day I got them, and the JVC even would not cover the charge	0

I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250	0

Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it.
Ease-of-use- Great.
Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files.
Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time"	1
Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge	0
"After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon! "	1
"We ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours.
It stopped working all of the sudden (no power)

Sent it for warranty, (part no labor). $160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it.

Would not but another camcorder from Panasonic (they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back)"	0
"This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot"	1
"I have tried everything. Firewire, USB. There was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your PC then to your camera, then turn on the PC then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order. If you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged. What kind of a crazy world does Panasonic live in?

Well, I followed the instructions to the tee, downloded the right drivers and all and yet my PC does not recognize the GS19 or the GS9. I have used both. The GS19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back. I thought, this model would have gone away with the kinks but, NO!

So, my panasonic recorded DVs are gonna remain on the tape. I will never be able to put them on DVDs. What a joke, this camera turned out to be"	0
"For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The ""shutter lag"" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.

My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.  I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality"	1
"One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website.

DEFINITELY find another brand"	0
"There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a ""pro-sumer"" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.
 
**The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards."	1
This camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio, however, I was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members. I took it back and bought a mini-DV camcorder as I was told it was easier to make copies. This has yet to be tested	0
I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&quot;x17&quot;	1
"This camcorder worked well, but I had two complaints with it.
1.  On the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker.  This alone made it unacceptable or what I wanted to do.
2.  I wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk.  This causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which I need to do.
If you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable.  I returned it and bought a Panasonic PV-GS35miniDV camcorder which uses the miniDV cassette tape.  Much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive"	0
"This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy! 	0
I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after &quot;2-4 pictures&quot; are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price	1
Don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  I ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  Did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  Now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  This is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  AVOID AT ALL COST, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PAYING THE EXTRA $10 BUCKS FOR AN ORIGINAL KODAK BRANDED BATTERY	0
Am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one.  I do not like that the viewfinder is no longer operational once you flip open the LCD screen.  Sometimes I like to verify my shot with both	1
I used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it.  It took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more, then nothing for the rest of the roll.  We swam with sharks and I have nothing to show for it. Should have bought a disposable one	0
"I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one.   Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com.   The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.   
By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best.   Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job.   One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations.     "	1
I purchased this camera for a friend to use in Hawaii.  We had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and I was frustrated.  I do not know if this is just a bad camera or what	0
"This lens does exactly what it should. The overall quality is extremely good. Take a look at my photos:

- First photo is without the lens
- Second photo is with the lens and flash
- Third photo is with the lens and without flash

There are a few things to note about the photos:

- There is a substantial amount of barrel distortion. This is normal. Try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious.

- Fringing is exaggerated. You notice fringing (purple or blue tints) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders. You can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens.

- The lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash. You can see the shadow in the photo with the flash. In a darker environment, it is very obvious. The external flash is the only way to fix this.

A couple details:

- You can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here:

http://www.lensmateonline.com/S2.html

- The camera has a setting (Converter) to indicate that you have the lens attached. It's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so I assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works.

Overall, I recommend this lens"	1
This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0
I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera	1
"As I have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult, as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus.  I thought this might be a solution.

This Eyecup fails on all requards.  Worst feature, the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect.  Second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless.   Last it has the cheep feel of Cracker Jack plastic, well and the optics to match.  Now I know where Olympus had it manufactured"	0

This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories. 	1
"The ME-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on Olympus's E-300 and E-500 cameras. Ideally, this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing. Unfortunately, this did not happen when I used the ME-1 to make a number of trial images with my E-500, so I will be returning the ME-1 for a refund. (For the record, I wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting, with my ""shooting eye"" corrected to 20/20 vision.) 

Like other folks, I find the E-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time. The camera must also be pressed against your face when framing, which is not always comfortable. 

In some ways, the ME-1 created more problems than it solved. The ME-1 kept the camera further from my face (though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses), but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder. Divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares. The four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible, but those along the sides, top, and bottom were *less* visible than before, the corners considerably less. To frame a shot, I had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the ME-1 than without it. To see exposure data, I had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image. More hassle than I need when shooting in the field.

Fortunately, there is another option that works for me. The E-300 and E-500 come with an EP-5 eyecup, which is definitely too small for my taste. But a larger eyecup is also available, the EP-6. The EP-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face. And with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted (a critical step no one seems to mention), the EP-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all. 

All of this will vary from person to person, of course, and there may be circumstances when the ME-1 is exactly what's needed -- so two rather than one star. But not in standard shooting conditions, especially if you need to compose, set exposure, and shoot quickly"	0
"The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3.
The previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer"	1

Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.	1
Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!	0
"
Canon has three digital cameras for $2,500+. The 1DS Mark II, the 1D Mark IIN and the relatively new 5D. I chose Canon over Nikon (which I've shot most of my photographic life) because of Canon's more impressive suite of lenses. Here's the decision process I went through. As with most products, it comes down to how you'll use it. All of them have tradeoffs.

1. Megapixels. More pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. The 1DS is the market leader at 16.7MP, the 5D comes in at 12.7MP and the 1D at 8.2MP. If you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1DS probably makes sense. If you're a wedding photographer, the 5D is probably the sweet spot. In practice, however, the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. At 8.2MP, you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. Up to that size, you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. That said, the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude. 

2. Full frame. The 1DS and 5D are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. The 1D and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (FOVCF). For the 1D, it's 1.3X. What that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is ""seeing"" - it crops the view in a little tighter. The result: your lenses are effectively 1.3X longer. A 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. Because the camera is effectively ""cropping"" the edges of the image that the lens produces, it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. Whatever camera you use, what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get, and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. My 300 mm lens with a 1.4X extender and a 1.3X FOVCF is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (If you're switching from film to digital, some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the FOCVF. Your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.)

3. Durability. This was most important to me, though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. Both the 1Ds and 1D sport complete metal bodies, sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles. The 5D - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000, is not weather sealed and has more plastic components.

4. Weight/size. What a solid, metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. For those who prefer a camera with heft, these have it. For many people, this is a big drawback. The 1DS and 1D are 43 oz., or almost three pounds for just the body, without the big battery. Add the battery and you're at 54 oz. The 5D is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. The 1DS and 1D, with built-in vertical grips, are also more than 2 inches taller. If you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around, the 5D is it.

5. Speed. There's a reason the 1D is the camera of choice for photojournalists, sports and many bird photographers. It shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second, compared to 4 fps for the 1DS and 3 fps for the 5D. For most day-to-day uses, 3 fps is more than adequate. From using both, I'd say the 1D autofocuses a bit faster, too. The 1D has 45 autofocus points, compared to nine for the 5D.

6. Price. Give or take a hundred here or there, the 1DS is about $7,200; the 1D about $3,900; and the 5D about $3,000. Price will determine whether you get the 1DS or not. If you can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision.

What did I decide? First, I looked at how I'd use the camera: photojournalism, travel and wildlife photography. The higher FPS was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed, so either the 1D or 1DS would do. In the end, I decided I'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (I bought the 300 f/2.8 IS for close to the difference in price.)

So, I went with the 1D Mark IIN. If my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car, I'd probably have gone with the 1DS. I'm VERY happing with the decision and the camera.

For most people and most uses - general portrait, landscape and travel photography - the 5D is probably the way to go. (Or perhaps the next greatest camera that Canon will announce later this year."	1
"So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.
But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!"	0

I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken.

I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working.

I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). 

I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. 

I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their ""macro"" photography shine. Get one! 

Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.

Edit: 

Just a clarification: 

This one 'is' the ""58mm"" even though above (on this page) when you click the links ""See More Technical Details"" and ""See all Product Description"" it mentions ""52mm"". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says ""58mm"". Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the ""58mm"" and 'is not' the ""52mm"".

Well, it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification"	1
This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller. I ended up going with a great case that i found at Wal-Mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town	0
"This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens.  It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range).  This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference.   While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros.

On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results.  This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures.  Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens.  This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works.

The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition.  There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance.  Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers.  This is one of those"	1
This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery. The belt clip is difficult to use, and I end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. There are better cases for this camera	0
"Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening?

 Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the ""L"" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me.

So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it.

This case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. It only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. There are other cases available with better features for less money	0
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.	1
"I found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper.

It's made by Samsonite.  model # TM90BLU (there is also a black case).  but like I said, exact same thing.  Unless you care about your camera case saying ""lumix"", save yourself some dough and get the one from Wal-mart"	0
"When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good ""business"" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them"	1
"This is the first digital camera that I have owned.  Overall I am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces.  However, there are a few things that, if I had known beforehand, would have prevented me from purchasing this camera.

1) Camera is not plug-and-play (even if they say it is).  You have to install the Kodak EasyShare Software to download pictures.  This is a HUGE negative.  In the future, I will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer.

2) Video is stored in Apple Quicktime format (*.mov).  The is also a huge negative.  The codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration.  You have to download and use Apple Quicktime to view them.  You can not view the videos in Windows Media Player.  It is also not compatible with some photo-album software.  I would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format.

Update:  After review, I have found that WinXP and Vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the USB port.  It does not work on Win2k.  Thanks for the comment that made me double-check"	0
Easily snaps in place and does the job.  Considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well	1
"I like this camera.  Some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience. For a first-timer, it has been great. The camera rates 4 stars.

Customer service, on the other hand, has been a disaster. An Easy Share software downloaded update didn't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution. After requesting to speak to a customer service manager, I was promised that a $7.95 CD of the software would be sent for free (though it was clear he was doing me a favor because ""these cd's cost money and don't grow on trees,"" he said. Whether or not the CD solves the problem remains to be seen. But customer service is awful.

To recap: Nice camera, but unless you have endless customer service patience, search out other options"	0
"This is the first SLR camera that I have ever owned.  I bought it because I was going on a trip around the world, wanted a nice camera, and had it recommended by a camera shop owner.   It is extremely easy to use, so easy that I could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries I visited, point to the button they needed to push and I ended up with a great picture.  I didn't need to explain a thing.  I also didn't mind carrying it around all day, it is very light for its size.  

 I have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures.  I have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera, from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great.  The action shots are never blurry!  The only complaint that I have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting, sometimes it is slow and sometimes it won't work at all.  In these cases I just turn on the manual focus option.

All the options that the camera has are great, but to be honest I rarely use them.  I've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center.  If I know that I'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes I will set the camera to that mode, but often I forget and my pictures still look great.

I think that this is an excellent camera, especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a SLR camera can give them.  There are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses, so when the photography bug gets you, this camera can stay with you"	1
"I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.
The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.

There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.

I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't"	0
"The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure.  Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an ""extension"" that allows for very remote exposures"	1
I bought this frame in Jan. '07 and the screen burned out March '07.  I returned it and the newest one burned out last night - April '07.  This product needs a redesign - the screens don't work for long.	0

"The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine.  However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal.  I don't usually want my ""serious"" photographs to have fisheye distortion.

I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit:  it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop.  You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera.

Either way, lots of fun.  Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these"	1
I bought this product from a nearby retailer. The packaging is deceptive. The Photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. The battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. This frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. This is an additional expense. After purchasing the Photoframe I discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. I took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before I found one which had an unbroken frame. I took that Photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. I then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). With the retailer's very helpful clerks I tested three more PhotoCo Photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). I returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email I requested a refund for the price of the battery. Photoco replied that if I sent them the battery they would refund its price. I mailed the battery on May 6,and then inquired about my refund on May 14. PhotoCo replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. On 3/17 I sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. PhotoCo said that my credit had been processed but that I might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. I still have not received my credit for the battery. If you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. Read the other reviews before considering this product	0

"NOWHERE on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card (MS or SD).  It will not operate without it!  On the back of the package it reads ""Download photos with USB cable (incl.) or simply insert memory card (MS or SD - not incl.)""  Wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot"	0

"The Photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering.  The ""Plug and Play"" ability is aggravating, at best, freezing two of my computers, requiring endless reboots to transfer images.  Photoshare provides ZERO customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual. The expensive battery is almost impossible to install.  The power cord has to be super glued to stay in place. And the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out.  Buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable DVD player instead."	0

"Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be ""portable"" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.    "	0

I added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city. Make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from CC, or else you will end up like me.

Though the lenses for my Nikon D50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this UV Protection Filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense. I feel less stress when I clean the filter lens than if I was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass. This size, 52mm, was what was specified for my D50 and it fits perfectly, as it should. I have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller. If you are new to digital SLR's like I was then get this filter to protect your lens. And spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens.	1
You have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that I have purchased it I discover that this battery doesn't fit this camera. It is listed wrong	0
This filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear. It remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter.	1
"Beware of poor CS policy at JVC. They recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. They were not interested in even trying to help.

"If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the ""Last 4"" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active ""picture happy"" family"	1
"This unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw.  I received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power.  After that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on.  It then failed completely and would not work at at all.

I returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that. On both units the mp3 player continued to work.  

There is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch.  

But for this problem it would be a wonderful unit"	0
"I, like many people, research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items.  Digital cameras are no exception.  I was looking for a replacement for my KonicaMinolta Dimage Z1.  My requirements were fairly straight forward:  the new camera had to have a 10x zoom, no less than a 5mp processing chip, and third, get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a DSLR.  I have read the reviews here on Amazon regarding the performance of the S9000, and while some of them, I felt, were right on, others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera.  The intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter.  While the S9000 does possess automatic functions to ""streamline"" use, these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that Fuji strove for in it's design.  Let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear:  IF YOU WANT BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, VIBRANT PICTURES WITH PERFECT EXPOSURE USING THIS CAMERA, THEN YOU MUST USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS.  THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT TYPE OF A CAMERA!!!!!!  Out of the box the S9000 has been a Godsend.  Not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras, but the exposure is so perfect that I question my ability for luck.  The setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap.  The white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography, and yet Fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design.  There really are two photographic miracles at work in the S9000:  one, is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment, and two, is that the exposure is so good that if I did not know better, I would think that I was using an advanced film SLR.  This is an absolute rave for this product.  The fit and finish are superb, ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use, and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a DSLR but not be too complex.  The only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure, but outside of some DSLRs, this is a problem with all digital cameras.  It is true that this camera is big and heavy, but then photographic perfection ain't free.  Home Run FUJI!!     "	1
Tried this as a possible improvement over using AA NiHM batteries in my Olympus D-524 camera. Turned out to be a DOWNGRADE. Did not stay charged as long as my Panasonic 1950 mAh AA batts. It would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down. I have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the AA NiHM batts. The CR-V3 now gathers dust. It did not even improve the flash recycle time. Just a waste	0

"THE battery is good after a full charge.  It lacks in holding the promised charge.  I find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. I got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, Which is more that my AA nimh 2100mah. Which I bought from Walmart {so probably not a super battery}  The wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.The charge time is not to long when charger from half charge.
Over all, I hope the next ones I buy will be better than these.  My solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the Delkin dies.  I also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  I also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  Every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  My Nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  All reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  Have been using 3 months now."	0
"I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc.

The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.  

If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc"	1
I've had this battery for half a year and I agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power. I am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory, but this Delkin model's life span was noticeably short. Now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because I don't want to buy another Delkin battery	0
It seems surprising that Canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials.  Lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
I bought this battery in July 2004. I charged it as soon as I got it. I put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. The battery was dead. So I charged it again and put it in the camera again. I used it and it seemed to work fine. But the next time I went to use the camera (Approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. As I write this review I am sitting in a hotel room in Prague. I charged the battery ten days ago. I used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(Did not use the flash). I then used it again today. I was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( Did not use the flash). I bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. So now I have to charge the battery everytime I use the camera. This was a big disappointment. I get better life out of the standard Duracell alkalines. It appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that Belkin has not perfected their quality control.

 One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart"	1
"  I purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews I could on the different kinds. The one I purchased was flawed, and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before I could get it to boot up. When it was running I was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures.
  What the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. This means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera, or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( A side note - if you have a Sony digital camera, Memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent, you took with another camera, or you reformatted with a photo program).

In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.

"Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.  

I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the ""kit"" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&H, Adorama, etc).

"I am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 Mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! Read on!

If you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on Page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. This is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.) 

Looking further on p13 it states: ""Choosing slideshow frequency Note: This function applies to photos stored on all media."" Page 27 in FAQ states: ""2) Q: Can I switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? A: Yes. When you connect your memory card to PhotoFrame(tm), it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card."" Finally, the Quick start guide FAQ states: ""Q Can I switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? A Yes, Digital Photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected."" 

Clearly the three references I provide indicate that the DPF can operate slideshows from a media card. IN REALITY SLIDESHOWS FROM MEDIA CARDS DOES NOT WORK. Philips how about a firmware upgrade?

I bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. I was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. All she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (Mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). Do not buy this DPF for older, none computer savvy people. Since media card can not be used, you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. The internal 16Mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. It is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. I believe the internal memory converts the file to a DPF friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (How is Mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?)
Why have media card slots if they are useless? Internal memory is way too small! DO NOT BUY and save yourself the hassle."	0

"I ordered this digital frame for my husband for Christmas, with the assurance from a ""tech weenie"" that it would work, based on the advertisement found at Amazon.

"I bought this camera for its great price, good reviews, and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. I returned the camera after three weeks, however, due to abysmal low light performance among other things.

The catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. I took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. Unfortunately, when we returned home to view our footage, much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes.

The camera does include a light and a MagicPix option, but unless you're using a tripod, you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (Perfect for recreating ""Thriller music videos,"" but not much help otherwise.)

I also found the image quality with the GS31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. Granted, you get what you pay for, but I was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage.

That being said, the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated), and the zoom is incredible. The camera is very light and smaller than I anticipated.

In the end, I returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...)

I will say that Amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. Also, if you do buy this camera, make sure to buy the DV cable (firewire for Macs) through Amazon or some other online retailer. (..."	0
"The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away.

The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering"	1
"We returned this video camera due to video picture quality. The camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a ""grainy"" look. We just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. Purchased the PV-GS65, next model up with 3CCD's and love this model. As a matter a fact we still had the GS-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the GS-65 did 100% better. 

The camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press"	0
"Not much to add to the other positive reviews posted, other than I am another user that loves my D50. Have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife).  Excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands.
The only CON I can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. Also, for people that are used to the little compact point & shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why I have a little pocket camera for my purse). I also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens"	1

"I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad.  I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood.  

However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor.

(1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit!

I hope this helps rather than confuse. :)"	1
I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck	0
This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
The camera came with no memory  chip.  The online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund.  Not a great experience	0
Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times.  It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top.  So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out.  It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy	1
"I was extremely disappointed with this camera.  It's a shame there is no option for zero stars, because it doesn't even deserve one.  I bought two of them for a vacation to Belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water, and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera.  Now I really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can. 

All of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible, terrible quality.  The camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water.  Those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of.  Extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water.  Not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none, so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives.

I was so disappointed in this camera that I wrote to Kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras.  Unfortunately our trip to Belize was a once in a lifetime trip, so I have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done.  And I have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. If you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories, DO NOT waste your money on this one.  The only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment.  I wish I had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it"	0
"I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful. 
 
 I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with. 
 
 First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera). 
 
 I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch. 
 
 Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above. 
 
 I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results. 
 
 The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this. 
 
 Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations. 
 
 For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable. 
 
 In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue"	1
My husband and I bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. Due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  One we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. The other I took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, I could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. After fighting with it the entire weekend, I ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too	0
Now that i have had this on my camera for a while now, my camera feels so weird with it off, i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. I wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain	1
I bought this camera and it took great pictures above water, but none of the pictures I took underwater turned out. I looked at the negatives and it was like I never even clicked the shutter. The negatives were blank where I took the underwater pictures	0
Canon's BG-E3 battery grip is one awesome extra you cannot be without.  I found the extra weight and size NOT to be even a minor burden.   I rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th St Photo did a fantastic job (once again)	1
"I purchased this camera and took it to the beach.  The photos were so bad, I threw them away.  The images were all washed-out and blurry.  Also, the film advancing mechanism is very tricky, so several of the pictures I took overlapped each other.  I've used other disposable cameras before that wouldn't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame.  With this camera, I advanced the film until the mechanism stopped, and the camera allowed me to take another picture.  Unfortunately, the film hadn't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that I had taken.  What a waste of money this camera was!

Thankfully, I had also taken my digital camera, so I still had some good pictures of my trip :)"	0
"My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him.  And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash.  So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash.  The Canon 30D comes up top on the list.  It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony).  And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing.  I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod.  Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh).  Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod.  This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old.  But you will need a good lens to make this work well.  If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick.  Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details.  The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money).  The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon.  They both have their strength and weakness.  Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon.  To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall.  But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography.  The D80 is like a ""mini"" D200, but slower.  So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend.  Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization.  If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you"	1
Made the mistake of taking this camera on a trip to the pool!!Pictures were horrible. Eye Piece is the biggest pain!! DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. If you want GREAT, GOOD, WONDERFUL pictures, buy the Fuji Quicksnap camera. Kodak could have done MUCH, MUCH better	0
This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion	1
I bought this camera after using a Sony MiniDV (very small one) camera over 8 years. The image quality of Sanyo is horrible compared to my old Sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. However price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. So if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.	0
I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
"I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try.

After one battery charge, I was ""lucky"" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge.

My observations from that first short use were:
- Quality of pictures was very poor (my Pentax Optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera.
- The flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality
- The camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands.  My wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes.
- The video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy).
- I had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality).

All-in-all don't waste your money.  You can get a much better camera at a lower price"	0
"Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod. 

It's common sense, but I've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards"	1
"This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB. However, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. The clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation.

We returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect, but the second unit had the same problem. Apparently, according to the manual, this is ""not a malfunction"""	0
"This is the same charger came with my digital rebel, however, I like to charge two batteries at a time. So, I bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. 

The prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact, flat and easy to take along with you. It's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with. "	1
"In theory, this camera is perfect. Fits into your pocket. Video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of MPEG-4. Pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. Perfect all around anytime camrea, right?

Here's the thing. I got the camera mainly for video. I just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that I could always have on me. Also, I did not want miniDV because uploading to the computer is real time. I wanted the SD card as film, even if it would sacrfice some video quality. But the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie. On the playback I cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses. It sounds like someone smoking a hooka. And get this, it even says so in the instruction manual, page 35, ""CAUTION During video clip playback, the sound of a motor is audible....During recording, the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded. This is not a malfunction.""

Awful.

By the way, the take a picture while recording video function is worthless. It leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording, and the still image captured is usually blury. Whats the point anyway, I think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video. Or you can do it with whatever editing software you use.

Oh, and one last thing. I have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic. My hand shakes too much. There is a digital stabalization for the video, but no optical stabilization for the stills.

Its a big shame, too. The camera is very cool. If not for the audible motor noise, I would have given this at least an 8/10. But the lens motor noise is unacceptable!

ps. all cameras today should have a built in lens cover. This is one has a cheap plastic one, that you'll probably lose"	0
"I have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment, especially for the price!
I very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than I can achieve with this lens.  
It's very solidly built and I am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come"	1
"I really wanted to love this camera. The camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans! 

I did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so I expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. The 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! Another huge plus is that each ""shot"" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a PC using a USB cable. No further processing - the file just copies and plays in Quicktime, etc. Another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.

Now the sad part; Amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the LCD and CCD. The bad pixels on the LCD, according to the manual, are expected and ""Not a malfunction""; I disagree with that. For the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the LCD monitor. The HUGE problem is the bad pixels on the CCD! This results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the ""image stabilization"". The image stabilization shifts the image the CCD receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! However, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. It's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.

The bad CCD is the reason why I can't love the C6... I gave up hope and sent both back to Amazon. I'm not sure what I will buy now."	0
"I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does.  I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well.

Well, it did great as it came but I found that I wanted to have the 1/1 capability so I bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up.  I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in.  This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away.  I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better.  (Works great, btw).

As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick"	1

I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches.  I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed.  It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches.  Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge.  If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you. 	1
"I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.

I have used this charger & battery package for a while now in my digital SLR, battery performance is excellent! The downside is that the charger has issues: The top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get VERY hot when charging, it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year I have had them. If you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these, and the charger is okay, just beware that it does not charge all NiMH batteries but does do most	1
I bought this camera in the beginning of January. I was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. Based on test reports at DPreview and other customer reports I decided for the Fuji F31fd. I was intrigued by the new sensor that Fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. After receiving the camera I took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different ISO settings, different exposure times, etc. I compared the pictures with my 4-year old SONY DSC-V1 and the results were amazing. The picture quality of the Fuji was very poor. Colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. Even under bright light conditions and ISO 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (RGB noise). I didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. What a disappointment. The lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the SONY DSC-V1 with a Carl Zeiss lens. After one week we returned the camera and I bought the SONY H5. This is really a great camera, I must admit. The picture quality is even better than with the V1 and I thought that the V1 was already pretty good. I can only recommend SONY's H5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller F31fd. What I liked about the F31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. However, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help	0

"I bought these binoculars because I wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding.  First time out, I had difficulty getting a clear focus.  To make maters worse, every bird that I looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head.  I have a pair of Nikon 10X25s which out performed the Bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. I am returning the Bushnell's and considering the Audubon Equinox HP binoculars instead.

This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots	1
Did not get Kodak Max, instead recieved regular Kodak CRV3 battery. I thought I was ordering a better version, seller NEEDS to change misleading picture!	0
If you have the big lenses (400mm f/2.8L IS USM or even the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM) this is totally worth the addition. The 2x does NOT kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges. Check compatability on Canon's website. You won't be disappointed	1
In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing.	0
Purchased a printer dock and camera bundle, from a local office supply store for $100. It only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge, so I purchsed this from amazon. Amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. It works great. No complaints. The paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that I still use for some pictures, but works well for my classroom, to give to my students. The pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them	1
The quality is not real HD looking.  The footage is jumpy.  The camera is terrible in low light.  Even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image.  I returned mine and I'm looking to getting the much better Sony HD cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it.  Being a professional filmmaker and knowing what Cameras shoot real HD, I quickly realized that I got ripped off.  This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night.  It seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent.  The size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great.  I was really disappointed because I was expecting something better.  Most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously	0
"I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a ""wonderful"" new feature like ""low light or non-shake."" This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description..."	1
"Before that it was kind of nice, but it cannot focus in even semi-low light.
It is definitely light and easy to take everywhere, but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing. No way I would call the output HD quality, just the best SD ever with a 16 * 9  format. And then it broke"	0
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.	1
I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem	0
Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT	1
"This camera has major problems.  Do your research.  Go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of  the ""black Screen"".    After using our camera about 5 times the screen became black.  Apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something.  Sent it to their customer care service.  Took 1 month to get back.  3 days later black screen is back.  Sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera.  They just want me to keep sending to customer. Care.     Sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras.  See for yourself.   Go to the forums and see what others have been saying.  Don't make the mistake I did"	0
"This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that"	1
"The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.

The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.

The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer."	0
"""Wow!"" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40.  I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness.  However, after using the Canon ""L"" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors.  The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the ""L"" lenses are amazing.  The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-)  Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200.  Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection.  Build is really good.  The ""L"" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable.  The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy.  But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference.  I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun.  The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well.  With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast.  I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily.  The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies).
Warning: once you use ""L"" glass, you are going to be spoiled.  You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read"	1
"I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!!
So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon."	0
"Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment"	1
I purchased a Nikon for my first camera, I just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. I couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. For my birthday I took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. I was so devistated. The video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. My friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. So maybe I just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a LOW BATTERY that it just might not want to hold them. A major plus I do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! That I'll give 5 stars to...everything else I'd have to say 2 stars!	0
Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.	1
I bougt this camera because I had had a Sony Coolpix 3, which took great pictures.  With this camera, you can never get it adjusted right.  If you use the flash the  pictures are to light, if you dont they are too dark.  It is a constant battle with this little cute camera. Worse camera purchase I ever made.	0
I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.	1
I bought this with my camera and I guess I didnt realize I could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price. My bad. But I would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $14 on one tape	0
"I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all.
I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right.
Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident.
Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day"	1
"I agree with reviewer Steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless.  The paper works says the ""may"" focus down to 35'.  Maybe some will but not certainly not my pair.  I am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard.  And no, the rubber eye caps ABSOLUTELY will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses (like me).

The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera.	1
"My cheap 10X50 Rugged Exposure brand binoculars give me a better view.  The rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and I couldn't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round ""binocular effect"".  I did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either.  Maybe with perfect vision they would work for, but I doubt it"	0
This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras).	1

Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it	1
"...unless they hadn't insisted on the ""geared"" telescopic part. It has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it, but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time I used it.

Yes, it's lightweight and somewhat unstable, but I can live with that. The biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials..."	0
I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i	1
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera	0
I spent alot of time evaluating this product.  Finally after reading the reviews I dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense.  It has been a wounderful addition to my Canon Reble.  It is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time.	1
"There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  ""If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction.""  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!  "	0
"From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers.  On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.

The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end.  The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod.  The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod).

Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason.


First of all, the focal length range is quite handy.  It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations.  The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good.

I have printed as large as 20x30"" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results.  Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print.

This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison.

If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX.  The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash.  


If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one.  If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field.  This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit.


Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens.  If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you.  If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value"	1
"I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision."	0
I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com.  The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included.  I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment.  I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions.  They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again.  Once again, no response.  I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo.  No response from Amazon either!  As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money.  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features.  However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service.  I will use neither one again	1
"This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??"	0

However, if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars, a right angle adapter will be needed.  I found one on eBay for a few dollars. "	1
"This is the 7th Olympus camera I've owned over the years, from film to digital.  I have always been very pleased with Olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  This camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in RAW, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process RAW images.  This renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in JPEG.  Olympus should have ensured that vendors such as Adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible RAW conversion Plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  There's no excuse for Olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible.

Having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  You can take quite good pictures.  However, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken.

The battery life is very good.  The camera fits nicely in your palm. And, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.  

If you don't shoot in RAW and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  Otherwise, look at other products at this time"	0
"I received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule. I've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater Boston area. 

You can't get a better tripod for the money. In fact, you can't get anything ""decent"" for under $40-50 and even then I'm not sure you will get something this good. 

I had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office (which I didn't know) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when I told them I only paid $25 for it. 

Conclusion: is the tripod perfect, NO. The head looks a little like plastic. But it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website. This tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer."	1
I was so excited to buy a camcorder that recorded straight to DVD AND took pictures.......Well, the picture quality is AWFUL! I have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000........The problem is its SO low in pixels. We hear about 5MP cameras and up, this camera has less than 1MP!!!! I bought this before I knew anything about megapixels........You have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent. All of my prints from this camera are bad! And they are only good for email. That's it. The camcorder capabilities are fair. My problem is that it doesn't work well on the computer, and it does NOT play immediately in all dvd players. You HAVE to buy the very expensive RAM discs for editing....Overall, I definitely would NOT buy again and I would not reccommend to a friend. I wish I had spent all that money on something else....	0
This is a replacement for an identical battery pack that I lost.  Works great, long life, no problems	1
This camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. In indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad. I tried to record in my living room where I have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred. In outdoor recording in a sunny day, picture quality is quite good with sharp colors. Zoom works well	0
It's good as my title says, however, I found one con about it is there is no place I can put a string on it so that I have to put it in my pocket when I take it off	1
I bought this camera for Christmas and it is absolutely horrible! It takes really bad quality pictures and it has a very noisy lens. It's a great looking camera but the screen is only 2 inches which is very small. This camera is not a good buy for it's class	0
I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one	1
Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one	0
Excellent choice to make a great job.	1
"The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event.
There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much).
There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket.
Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches.
If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will"	0
"The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry."	1
The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	0
"I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a ""wonderful"" new feature like ""low light or non-shake."" This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description..."	1
In the past, I have considered Amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites. To be perfectly honest, I am no longer sure. Two months ago, I bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on Amazon. This camera set was called the 1 GB Stylus 720 SW kit. Ironically, the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 GB cards! My first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories. Two weeks after receiving the kit, I emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake. After waiting a few weeks for a response, I decided to send them a second email. Again, no response. By this point, I felt helpless and turned to Amazon for aid. Surprisingly, Amazon was not much better than 47th st photo. Minutes after sending the email to Amazon, I received an automatic email informing me that Amazon had received my email. That was the last I heard from Amazon. More than two months have passed and I have not heard from either company	0
"If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp).

The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size.

If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens"	1

"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it."	1
So, you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a Panasonic PB-GS65 DV camcorder. It is a digital video camcorder, after all. That's why you bought it. Well, guess what? It doesn't come with a DV cable to plug it into anything. That is so pathetically stupid I take it as an outright slap from a company that must think I'm just some sort pain in their shorts. It cost me completion of a project that I had to put together as soon as the camera arrived. So, Panasonic, I'll post a negative review of as many of your products I possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as I've ever had to deal with. Oh yeah, and you're camcorder is being returned. Go buy a cable and have a ball	0
"In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the ""idiot modes"" (i.e. ""portrait"", ""landscape"", etc.) with modes that you could customize"	1
We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders.  However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working.  It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center.  They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  I only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  Panasonic did not honor our warranty	0
"This is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital SLR camera and it was a good investment. I don't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera. It also  looks nice on my Canon 30D camera, coupled with an ""L"" series zoom lens"	1
If you want a nice camera that works well for 15 months, then look no further.  But mine died completely and is headed for the electronic recycling bin.  I didn't realize I was getting a disposable when I bought it	0
I started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. Having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap, this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least, is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself, allowing full ease of rotation of the camera.  Though I have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of AA batteries, having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and I am in the heat of shooting. I always travel with my charge AND four AA batteries. I would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the EOS-20D and EOS 30-D. One thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases.	1
"Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to ""evaluate"" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the ""evaluation"" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc). 
 Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!!
Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!"	0
The balance with the grip on is really much better.  Yes I am aware there were problems with some earlier ones, but mine seems just fine (knocking on wood as I type)	1
"Cons only, no pros:
the velcro closure is week and opens easily
terrible look
the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless
no space for extra memory or battery
attaches only to a very small belt
the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash"	0
Over the years I have been using Quantum Turbo and later 2x2 units ( No Turbo SC yet) to power various Canon speed-lights from 540EZ to EX580. With some skepticism I picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment. Well, although Quantum units  still have a place in my kit to power Metz Unit, I love the convenience of CP-E3. One recommendation. Buy couple of extra battery inserts, if you do lot of fast shootings, and keep them loaded with good quality Duracell NIMH's	1
"Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2"" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use. "	0
"This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B & H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. 
People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful"	1
"The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense.
Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.
Other than the above, the monocular has performed well.
epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it."	0
I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4. 	1
"I bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. Once I spotted a deer and turned on the ""IR"" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much"	0
This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
"The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.  

Also, there is too much ""noise"" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.

The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.  

Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.  

By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic"	0
Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots	1
It was suggested by Amazon.com that I buy this product since I was purchasing a Canon PowerShot S2IS Digital Camera. Not knowing any better, I bought it.  It doesn't even WORK with this model camera. I bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether	0
"I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality.   I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak.

I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880.  The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350.  I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well.   The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range.   Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs.   The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos.   RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro.  Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe.   Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well.   The direct mechanical zoom is also nice.

Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR.   

Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light"	1
"It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.

Do not buy this camera. 

It did take decent movies, and the size is nice"	0
"The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.

The EN-EL3e is backwards compatible with the EN-EL3: you can put it in your D70 or D50. The reverse is not true.

The number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors, including shooting style, LCD usage, and of course, camera. (The 2.5"" LCD on the D200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller D70.) It is sufficient for a day of shooting. Unless you are using a D200 in some professional capacity, in which case, you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery"	1
"Poor and slow Focus and flash. Thought Nikon had a good name.......Wrong
If you like this camera it must be you first digital"	0
"This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography.
I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously.

I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR.
The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming.
Unfortunately so are it's limitations.

So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates.

Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control.

I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE.

I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned.

This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost.

This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities"	1
i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked.  the older model is far superior.  this camera is slow to focus, slow to shoot, and slow to save.  i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition (indoor, medium light) on the automatic setting, all 5 pictures turned out different, only one turned out clear.  i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with	0
"There's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. But for $16 the Sima SMP-1 is a tremendous value. 

I have a Sony DSC-W5 digital camera and have done everything I can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. This monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. 

The key is that it is small enough and light enough that I can take it almost wherever I go. And because it's so small, I can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. 

A monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. But this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that I take on trips"	1
"This is not the best way to get started in astronomy. 

The low power eyepiece is fairly useful, the higher power one less so, and don't even think of using the barlow.  The maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x, assuming the objective lens is of good quality. When you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope, you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown.  

To their credit, the manufacturer has provided a reflex ""red dot"" finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes.  

Even so, what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited.  Some star clusters will be dimly visible, but galaxies and nebulae will be barely--if at all--visible. 

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6"" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: ""So you want to buy a telescope."	0
The case is great!  It fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what I expected to receive when ordering.  The price was right but the shipping was a little higher than I expected	1
"This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  

3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

"I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy.
 The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well."	1

"I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it.

First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.

All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.  

I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.

I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera"	1
"The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.

But of course  you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer.
The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash.  At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy."	0
"If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series.

However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens.

A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well.

Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom"	1
This is not at all suitable for young children.  It's awkward and difficult to use.  We're sending it back.  Totally inappropriate for children	0
I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it.  It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images.  As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots.  I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots.  The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products.  For the price range, this is an excellent lens.  You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens	1
I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	0
"I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.

I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject.

As others have stated, this is a heavy lens.  It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images.  I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems...

If you are tight for cash, this isn't the ""one lens"" that does it all.  If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens."	1
"I had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. After a lot of research, I settled on the Pro Tour Laser. 
As previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  I have a feeling this is true of all lasers. 
Even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car I found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present. 
On the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping. 
This unit has been returned and I have gone to a standard handheld GPS instead. Once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. I do this with a chart taped on the back of the GPS. Accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper. 
I am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles. "	0
"I wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... I'm so glad I did. With the smaller sensor on my 30D, the 100mm is more like 150mm or so, so it's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. I've uploaded a few photos I've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. I thought the 17mm-85mm IS USM lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens, the kit lens might as well be from a DIY pinhole camera.

My less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. When I'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower, there is a lot of shake. I can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud, so I have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and I miss some really cool shots. 

In addition to the lack of image stabilization, I am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. I wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only, so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time.

I've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. The telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. I recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. I practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos I wanted, but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and I wanted to use natural light over flash.

The lens is long and heavy for its range. With the addition of the battery pack grip, this lens added on is very weighty, so I may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. Once I add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit, my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions.

It's tack-sharp, but it can be frustrating at times"	1
Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price	0
I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?	1
"After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder. 

When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.

I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.

I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.

UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return)"	0
"The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry."	1
"Like other reviewers, after careful research, I decided to purchase this product. It was affordable, received good reviews, and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range. When I received it in mail, I was quite happy: it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what I had expected. The screen was bright and very attractive. 

The problems started about three weeks following the purchase. First, the slideshow option (the kind with music) stopped working. Whenever I pushed the slideshow button, the screen would completely freeze and I had to restart the unit in order to use any other function. I thought, no big deal, I would just exchange the frame for another one.

My second unit arrived yesterday. This one, however, started having problems right out of the box. After about 5 minutes into the slideshow, the screen started flickering, than shaking, became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically. I played it two more times after that, each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow.

It is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential (big, bright screen); unfortunately, the software is very buggy. I checked the Portable USA website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix. I will have to return this unit again, this time for a refund.

My assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box. However, I would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership"	0
"I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.  

The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag.

The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.  

Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.   "	1

"There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  ""If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction.""  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!  "	0
It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.

"I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision."	0
Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.   	1
This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0

This lens is amazing. Nothing escapes it. It's like a black hole. Clearly the best lens I have ever owned. It's like the lidless Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. It is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera. It comes with a beautiful case, a hood, and a tripod mount on the lens. Believe me you will need it. I took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great. I will now get to work reading the small manual. It has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings. Wow!	1
I got this telescope for my desk at work because I have a decent view.  It stinks, I think I can see better with my naked eye.  Plus you can not focus it because the slider is so stiff.  I guess I will be buying another telescope now	0
This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way.  I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing.  Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc.  The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!!

Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see	0
"After using both lenses I think this is much better. Here are my reasons:

1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate.
2- Bokeh is much better in this one.
3- Macro is slightly better on this one.
4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size.
5- IS is not very crucial in 24-50 range."	1
I bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos.  We promptly sent it back for a refund.  I would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor!	0
"I think it very well could be so I'm not going to differ with those who say it is.I bought this to use with a new 5D and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off. 

I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps.  I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick. 

I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots.

Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus.

One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. But I've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. The effect with lights, etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field. "	1
I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase	0
"If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one"	1
Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote.  Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine.  Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working.  Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?).  Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro?  Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files.  Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality.  E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback!  Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act	0
"15 years of photography experience here... The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all. 

Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs. 

Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. 

This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens"	1

"If I could, I would give this camcorder a 0 of 5. Since I now have to search for a new camcorder, from reading other Panasonic model reviews, I am convinced I did not just get a lemon, but the Panasonic brand is bad. 

We bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son. It has had problems from the beginning. First, I could not finalize the disk. I called Panasonic support, who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording. This is ridiculous since I often set the camera down on a countertop so I can be in the video. Then I finally got someone to tell me that I needed to be recording on Panasonic mini-DVDs. The best it has worked have been on the Panasonic DVDs which are some of the most expensive, and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the DVD after finalization. I still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch. It has skipped over whole sections. I have 3 DVD players in my home (all different brands) and the disk works on none of them.

I finally got an address to send it in for repairs. I was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time. I was told they would look at the camcorder, see if there was a problem and call me. I waited a week after I knew it was in the shop to check the status. Panasonic FAILED TO MENTION that I would need to pay $207.50 UP FRONT for them to look at it, then if any repairs were needed, this cost would cover them as well. SO, I have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing, and the company I sent it to has not even looked at it because I have not paid them! This is crazy since I can get a brand new miniDV camcorder for $225. 

The only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at Best Buy. So you see why I couldn't just take it back to the store (or I would have a long time ago)! Also after spending over $500 on this piece of junk, I could not afford to just replace it. Sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn, because I didn't want to miss any precious memories (which I ened up missing anyway!). So now the holidays are upon us, and I will be forced to purchase another camcorder, since I don't know if they will send it back to me in time for Christmas. I will not pay the $207.50 for a camera that hasn't worked well out of the box. I also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing!

Plus another thing, the still picture is bad quality. Very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it. We only used that function once. 

I have lost so many disks, and have so many others that only play part of the DVD that when I think of it I cry. I have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless. I wish I would have never bought this camcorder! IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS CAMCORDER TO CAPTURE MEMORIES, BUY ANOTHER! I will not buy Panasonic products again!"	0
It is a great compact camera with a good zoom.  I can now leave a larger lens on my Nikon DX 70 and use this for closer shots.  YOu do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. I really like it for most general quick shots, carry it wth me most of the time	1
After reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit. I compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls (orion, knigth owl, gso) and the celestron's optics looked the worst one. I sold the kit after 2 weeks..	0
"This camera has been called a ""pro-sumer"" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.

CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)

PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture"	1
"I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.  

Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.  

To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE"	0
I bought this filter for my 28-135 IS canon lens and so far it has worked out great.  Unlike some of the other tiffen filters I bought, this one fits just right on the lens.  All sides are even and it sits flush against the lens.  I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures I've taken yet, but I haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens.  The night shots I've take so far, I've been quite pleased with, however	1
"I took it straight out of the package, plugged it in for a charge.  Charger never reached ""green"" ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later.

Customer Service was not the best I've had.  Don't make the same mistake, keep looking"	0
i have another camera w/ 12x optical & tons of features but i wanted something compact & ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :)	1
if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool, it's ok. but,if you are the open water diver, please don't buy it. i try it yesterday, it will not work after 10m/33ft, it will show the red screen and count down timer, it scare me. and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday's dive. it's really disappointed to me	0
"I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything! 

I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again. 

I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you"	1
"Cons only, no pros:
the velcro closure is week and opens easily
terrible look
the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless
no space for extra memory or battery
attaches only to a very small belt
the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash"	0
"I wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera. Those with larger zoom are quite bulky, you can't carry around all the time. I think a slim camera is a better choice. I slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. You can't do it with a huge camera. 
After I made up mind about a slim camera, my choices were either Casio Exilim or Sony DSCW series. Casio Exilims are very sexy. They have a lot of mode scenes. They also function as voice recorder. You can take pictures of book pages etc. They have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. I was almost buying a Casio Exilim. Being a diligent person I wanted to search more and more. 
I found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. Many people found it useless. That was a good reason to choose Casio. Then I found the picture quality of Exilim is not really good.I found some pictures taken with Exilim. They were soft, not crisp colors. Search the web reviews made by photo professionals. Casio Exilim is rated significantly less than Sony in picture quality. With ISO 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . Those same reviewers however found Sony DSCW doing a better job . There was no noise with ISO 400 which means even in lower light condition Sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). Big difference!.
One feature of Sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. It is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it. 
Now comparison of Exilim and Sony to summarize:
Casio Exilim
Anti-shake (it's a bogus)
Slim   
Lower macro (2.5 inches)
Lower picture quality (detectable noise at ISO 200)
A lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
Sony DSCW Series
Slim (in fact it is slimmer)
Higher macro (0.74 inches)
Higher picture quality (No noise in ISO 400)
Not a lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
So.....I purchased a Sony DSCW 7 Mp. I took lots of pictures.
They are all brilliant, detailed and crisp, true colors.
I tried macro and took pictures of bugs. You can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. Absolutely no noise whatsoever, no blurry.
It's a marvel of technology. I took pictures of fireworks in July 4th using high ISO setting. They came out brialliantly like professional pictures.
It also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. So you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). But you can always recharge it. And it lasts much much longer than AAA or Nimh batteries. 
It was a perfect choice. I highly recommend it."	1
"Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2"" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use. "	0
"I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it. It has a lot of features despite its size. And for point and shoot I can say it's a great buy, comparable to other power packed cameras, it even takes better pictures sometimes.

But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it. But you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. But over all it's a great camera. If you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek, this is definitely a good buy."	1
"I purchased this camera in December 2005 to replace my 7 year old Sony Digital 8 camcorder. Unfortunately, everything except size is inferior in the Panasonic compared to the ""ancient"" Sony.  The color is not nearly as sharp, the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long.  The sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself. The camera's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer's editing program.

The Panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other miniDV camcorders lack. This allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights. It uses a toggle to control the exposure and, while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the Sony, it is adequate.  Unfortunately, it functions so poorly in low light it wouldn't provide adequate color in an auditorium.

I thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the Panasonic than my old Sony. Maybe it's because the camera is so small it's hard to keep as stable as the larger Sony.

Video editing on a PC is equally easy on the Sony and Panasonic but the Panasonic's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with Sony's Digital 8. 

If you don't HAVE to record in miniDV format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera, I'd recommend buying an inexpensive Sony Digital8 for about a third of the price of the GS250. 

If you do have to have a miniDV camera and you won't be shooting in bright sunlight, try another brand.

This upper end 3CCD camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless I need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day. Otherwise, I'll use the old Sony so I can share the video I shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality"	0
"Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage.

f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one. 
the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 
105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 
Plus the macro option is weaker on this one.

If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho."	1
Try to call Panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first. Panasonic service is the worst one in this world.	0
I own several Canon lens for my 20D and this is hands down the best.  I had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews, and I got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways.  (Of course, it costs a lot more).  Recently went with the grandchildred to Sea World and I got 100% good photos, with several really outstanding ones.  It is light, accurate and has IS - what more do you want?  You can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it.  Bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment.  If you have one lens, this is the one	1
Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality	0
"I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first ""L"" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, & CA are much better. Build quality & feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try & get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens."	1
I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all.  Overall don't waste your time and money	0
"     Despite reading glowing reviews about this lens, I was still surprised to see how well it performed.  The lens is SO sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes, from a distance of three quarters of a Football field away, shooting hand held, with late afternoon light, which will print a 5x7 and still look like a Pro took them!
If you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can't afford, or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures, then you should give this lens your serious consideration. "	1
"I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. 

I have now had 3 different brands of 8"" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.

I have developed the following list of features in my ""ideal"" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.

Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3.
Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.
Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too.
Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)
Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.

Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. 

I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.

The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)

The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.

Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos."	0
" At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics.
 I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience"	1
"My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.

I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see"	0
"For the price and quality I rated this lenses with 5 stars.
If you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos I took in Europe.  I too around 5000 photos. I posted a few on the web (See link below).

For the price I recommend this lens as walk around lens. The zoom is pretty usefull They are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. Get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more.

Here are some of my pictures taken in Europe with this lens (Images have been compressed):

"Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: ""that is it, nothing to do on it!"" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.	0
"This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non"	1
"I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one.
The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for"	0
"After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal.

"I bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak Z700. I  loved my Z700, even though it was only 4MP and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. I figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6MP would be a no-brainer, but I was disappointed in 2 major areas. First, the lag time is so slow on the C653, when I took pictures of my kids I rarely got what I was expecting to see. The smile or look that I saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. We experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. The other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. Anything I shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. Every background was grainy. Terrible. Using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in ""Sports"" or ""Kids"" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the Z700 for taking pics of the kids). On my Z700 (which is only $150 now), I could set it and forget it. Set it to ""action"", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary. That's what I thought I was getting in the C653, but I was wrong. I ended up returning the camera"	0
"This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot"	1
"Grainy ISO 100 pictures at any light conditions. Usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem, but if you take pictures with Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera.

In FZ8 camera Panasonic implemented the Venus III processor (FZ7 has Venus II processor). As a result picture quality really improved at high ISO sensitivity modes but DRAMATICALLY changed for the WORSE in ISO 100 mode"	0

I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.  I suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory.  If you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating.  It is also frustrating to discover Smith Victor does not have a support site (just references on photography).  They do not even provide a support # or address.  Keep all this in mind when considering something from this company	0

"I bought this lens in May for my brand new Rebel XT. I used it on a vacation mainly, and am pretty dissapointed. I'm no pro, or even skilled amateur, but I do know the lens is not giving me quality shots.

The autofocusing is slow, and af or manual shots aren't very sharp at any zoom. There seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me.

I wanted a good, all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types. I guess this would fit the bill, if it took sharp pictures. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for this lens again"	0

I recently moved into the prosumer level of digital.  The Canon D30 has proven to be an awesome camera.  There maybe better (D60), but if you are serious about digital, the D30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price.  There is a slight lag between shots, but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains, the time between shots is hardly a distraction	1
Me and my wife bought the JVC camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. At first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. We have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. We returned it to get another and it did the same thing. WE thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. I do not recommend this to anyone	0
I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&quot;x17&quot;	1
We returned this item.  It was a glorified external DVD burner.  It was not worth the money	0
"This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

"I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras)."	0
Wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take	1
"Ordered one new from B&H.  In the 1x mode the top light came on, no worries.
Turned on the bottom setting of the switch, 2x, nothing. Neither light came on.
Pitiful.  Sending it back"	0
"First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color ""USM"" at the front of the lens.  

According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter. 

People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT.

Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely. 

1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.)

2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers.

3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. 

Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens. "	1
Not seeing many reviews, I'm writing this as a warning. This mic is horrible. I bought it to get rid of the &quot;motor noise&quot; from my Canon Optura Pi, as many others have. When I listen now, the sound is much worse. You can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... THIS MIC IS HORRIBLE	0
"Let's be honest...  a ""kit lens"" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't!

I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots.  Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses.

If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens.

Please don't let some of the other ""lens snobs"" sway you - a few of which are actually ""posers"" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value.  I can hear them now.. ""it isn't contrasty enough"", ""the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end"", ""pin cushion is significant""...

I say BAH!!

Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree.  But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky.

Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!!  

If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost.  

Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures...  good luck"	1
"I bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera. The night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible. It snaps and pops all night long and I have to move it all around to find ""just the right spot"".I actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise. I live in a single story 2100 sq. foot house. I should have returned it right away, but I kept it because I had no other monitor at the time. Now, 10 months later, the volume control does not work anymore! I am now trying to find a new monitor. I love having the video monitor though, so I will look for a different brand"	0
My search for a semi pro Digicam made me do a lot of research and after I shortlisted a few models I had to find the best deal. Amazon helped me get that deal and today when I look at the performance of the camera so far.. I am amazed... The camera was bound  to be good but a special thanks to Amazon.com for helping me get one at a gr8 price	1
"I received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something I had particularly wanted.  I was extremely disappointed when I found it didn't work at all!  There is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference.  We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. I swear it was supposed to have ""night vision"" - forget it, non-existent.  I'm off the video monitoring; I'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor"	0
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors	1
Because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. You have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. We have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. We went with Graco's excellent digital iMonitor.	0
"I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc. 

My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries.

Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it"	1
"Very dissappointed.  My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  Audio just static and noise.

I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work.  Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you.  This is the last I purchase equipment on-line.  I will stick to books thank you very much"	0
"I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close.

I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money"	1
This monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. We purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. However, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. We were still able to have audio recpetion. After 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. Not a good camera for long term	0
"I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally ""brochure reading averse."" 

Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit"	1
This camera has a very poor lens. At 1x zoom, the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous; try taking a picture of a tiled wall. Image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100%; scaled down on a computer monitor, the quality is OK. Color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance.

"An excellent flash to use with my Canon 20D at a fantastic price, the Canon 580ex was an expensive option, but should I buy one in the future ? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit.
Great product from Canon as always "	1
"Review:
Unit had a very large defect in the field of view. It's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube; those I am aware of as I have other night vision devices. This goes about 1/4 of the way across, near the center. Had to return it. Poor quality control.

Update - the new one does not have any image defects. It also doesn't focus as sharply as the first one did (or my other one does), but it isn't too bad"	0
Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.	1
It never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months. Don't buy, you've been warned	0
Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.	1
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera	0
"This camera is really great.  I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a ""loaner"" while my 20d was in repair.

Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d.

The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands.  The features are great too.  And the image quality is awesome.  I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job.  Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars.

The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering.  The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d. "	1
"There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  ""If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction.""  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!  "	0
"This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that"	1
"I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision."	0
"I mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the S2 IS.  It does well to protect the lens, but you can't put a lens cap over it.  It ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures.

The pictures are very good through it"	1
"This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??"	0
"I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it.  It is as fantastic as others note herein.  The 2.8 through the focus range is really great.  Superb.  The VR function is really a neat trick.  It is super fun to play with.

The drawbacks are size and weight.  After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired.  Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera.  This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body"	1
"The leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an SD card to stick onto it.  I have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but I decided not to chance it. I am surprised that Canon cautions against placing the camera in Strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature!

Although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse.

The neck strap is OK, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera.

The battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money"	0
"This lens has only two ""faults.""  First, it is big and heavy--quality construction often yields a heavy lens.  Second, once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce, there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag.

Results first: the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my Nikon D70s.  I can get shots that I never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image. Subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp--as if shot with an excellent prime lens. This is a fast lens (F/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range).  Almost more importantly, this lens has the best ""Bokeh"" that I have ever experienced in a lens.  ""Bokeh,"" to the extent that I understand the concept (it is a Japanese word meaning roughly ""unfocused""), is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image (i.e. a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus) has a pleasing look to it.  This lens produces wonderful, creamy Bokeh.  The sharpness and Bokeh, combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens, makes this one a true classic.

I have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject, i.e. the sun reflecting off of the ocean.  This is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements, and I have sometimes experienced this.  But such occasions are rare.

The autofocusing action of this lens is very good.  Even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick, snappy autofocus lock on my Nikon D70s.  Very seldom does it ""hunt"" for an AF lock, and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens.  This lens also features Vibration Reduction (VR) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an F/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for.  The VR really works, too, although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting.  

This is one of Nikon's professional lenses, and the quality of construction is excellent.  The critical mount is metal, and the entire lens is built like a tank.  The lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap, and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage.

The reader can see that I am extremely enamored with this lens.  The reason is that, notwithstanding its bulk and weight, this lens produces the best nature shots that I have ever managed to take, by far."	1
"My Coolpix 8800 lapsed into ""system error 2"" mode within weeks of getting it.   After taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and I have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs.  Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help.   Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost...   The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price.  The controls are ridiculously complex.   The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk.  The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable...

"If you're looking to capture ""The Decisive Moment"" with the Nikon Coolpix 8400, STOP---DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!! For that matter, carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture ""action,"" because what you think you see,  may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image.
Let me briefly explain where I'm coming from: I made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years. By the time I retired out of the business I had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images. I owned and used mostly Nikon equipment all those years (although I sure liked working with Leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses), starting with the original Nikon F SLR (which I still have) and finishing up with the N90S and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths. I like Nikon equipment a lot.
I decided to begin working with digital images last year. I was attracted to the Coolpix 8400 because the ""spread"" on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm--85mm. When I worked with film I probably used my 24mm and 105mm Nikkors more than any others in my bag, so this little Coolpix beauty had just about what I was looking for in one package.
Let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism, it is, nevertheless, a marvel of human ingenuity. For many other uses---such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture (put another way, things that don't move), it works wonderfully well. 
Seriously, I shot an assignment here in Tucson that was essentially architectual in nature. The images can only be described as superb (if I do say so myself). I worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot. Working inside I simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 (which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days), did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter, etc. Point being that with film I often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate Gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment. Even then, I'd sweat blood until I could get the processed film on a light table. Of course with digital, I (you) don't have to worry about any of that stuff. One can check the image immediately and know instantly if you're good to go.
Alas, the shutter lag on this, and many other digital cameras made these days, is the ""downcheck"" which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. There is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with. The combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image, the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second. I have taken many good pictures of people working, ""action"" shots and the like, but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what I intended that I achieved my purpose. Essentially, my shooting eye (which is pretty damned good) had nothing to with it. It's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun---if he fires enough rounds, one of them is going to hit the other guy. Marksmanship has nothing to do with it.  Same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag. If you shoot enough images, statistically you're probably going to get a good one. But it's not a very good way to do things. 
So if you're looking to capture what Henri Cartier-Bresson (I'm not sure I've spelled his name correctly) so artfully described as ""The Decisive Moment,"" look at a digital single-lens reflexes, or wait for improvements in digicams.

"This camera is simply amazing!  I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N.  I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D.  My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N.  Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what?  It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did.  

For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor.  Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide.  Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D.  And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way.  I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living.  This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world.  With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes).  This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro.  

Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures.  But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D.  With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc.  As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there.  Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can.  The resolution and MP is definitely enough.  Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to.  The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D.  I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it.  Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo.

"Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a ""electronic viewfinder"" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera.

The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot. 

The ""display"" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.

The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.

After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to ""Ritz on Amazon"" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back ""within 10 days of receipt of purchase"", their ""date of order"" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a ""delivery confirmation receipt"".

The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the ""10 days"" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it"	0
the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder	1
It fits in the S1, but it doesn't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the OEM version.  When it doesn't charge I just re-insert the batter and it works, but its sort of a bummer	0
"I had a chance to compare it with a Tokina glass. Canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion, same or even slightly worse on a sharpness, and complete looser on a build quality.
If you are ok with 12mm - get Tokina"	1
I am not satisfied by this product. The calrity is not good. Also this is the most battery consuming device I have ever seen	0
"Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs....

Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters. "	1
"I was very happy with the previous model DSC-N1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. But this one, while I only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. The pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, I used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1MP! 

I'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible I will return it, I just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures. And after reading the previous review about the terrible Sony custmer servce, I decide I will avoid Sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.  

Note: Found the review by Cecelia Choy ""cece"" on March 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem I had. I didn't have this problem with my previous model DSC-N1. 

April 17, 2006: I bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! Suggestion for those having the same problem I had before -- exchange for another one!!"	0
"In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the ""idiot modes"" (i.e. ""portrait"", ""landscape"", etc.) with modes that you could customize"	1
I ordered two of the items above in error.  I did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from Antonline.  I have been trying since Dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  I am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  I just wish I could get return labels and my account credited.  They are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  Thank you for being interested. I was informed by them that my time had expired.  I do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them.	0
"I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years.  I also have a D70 for backup.  The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability.  If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand.

That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke.  For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE.  The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars.  Come on, Nikon, be real!!!

Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog.  I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog.  By the time I found out, it was already at the printer.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great.  After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results.

This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button.  In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera.  It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera.

I can't wait to try the D80"	1
"When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion.

Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging"	0
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere	1
I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.  Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery.  The price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers	0
"The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry."	1
"If you want a quality product, this ain't it.  The dreaded ""Remove the Cassette"" error is true and in full force.  Don't take my word for it, search the net and find the hundreds, upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way.  I highly suggest the Panasonic AG-DVX100.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it.

Before reading other reviews, make sure that they are comparing the GL-2 to another cam, like Tony L. Shores.  He compares the Canon GL-Piece-of-junk-2 to the Sony HDR-FX1.  Sure, the Sony is much better, but it is also a High-Definition cam.  If you want HD, check out the Panasonic AG-HVX200.

Do your research, read the reviews"	0
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly	1
I bought this over the Sony and I regret it.  I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind.  I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem	0
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is.  This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces.   I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 	1
"My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1.
I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.
The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony.
The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.
However, beware of the rebate offer.
I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.
The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code.
If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony"	0
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses.  While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now.  We got the back up battery pack.  My husband and I love it	1
"I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:

1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..

2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.

3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.

As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices."	0
"Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. 

The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard.

The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups"	1
This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again	0
This small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money. It's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear, but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to   hit you lens	1
I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.	0
"Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile"	1

I had an older Canon camcorder that I was very happy with, so I decided to get this new one. I ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. I even tried the same model at Best Buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. But compared to a similar Sony model, the Canon was noticeably louder while operating. Way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	0
Good basic set of inexpensive filters.  Nice case.  Great for a beginner/starting set.  If you're willing to spend more money on filters, getting B+W or Hoya will suit you better. 	1
"I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my ""must-have"" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian ""New Reviewer"", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??)

The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'.

I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback.

In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be"	0
"When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate!

So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products.

It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it.

I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger"	1
"I was attracted to the Cannon ZR800 due to the very small size and very low cost.  However, you get what you pay for, although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost.  I've already returned my Cannon ZR800 and replaced it with the Sony DCR-HC38.  The smallest problem with the Canon is the continued motor noise, which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the ZR800 predecessors.  The problem is that the motor is very loud, and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors.  This could be forgivable given the low cost, but the problem with the zoom noise is not.  When you zoom in and out, a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch.  It is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video.  It is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click.  It is annoying, unusual and a big flaw with these new ZR Cannon camcorders.  I called technical support, the person took a ZR800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist (she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring).  Bottom line, this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free.  Do not but it.

BTW, I love the Sony DCH-HC38 which is a bit more expensive and, like the ZR800, just recently came onto the market.  "	0
I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely	1
"I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated ""flipping"" of the flash that some other users have reported.  The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called ""Gadget Infinity"" under the listing title of ""Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature"".  Buy it now price is $29.99.  I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier.

This is an elegant leather case for the Canon elph cameras. It fits in the pocket easily. I'm satisfied	1
This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0
Excellent case, no question about it. It is stylish and well-put together. This can not be worn on a belt, though, it must go in a pocket, purse, or in your hand. The main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound, and it looks good doing it.	1
"I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.  

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision."	0
Case is pretty much what you see...I have no complaints. =)  The case protects my camera very well	1

"Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3"" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner"	1

The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing."	1
"I can't say for sure that my experience was typical, but I can say that it was horrible.

The short version is:  I had to return it once for a screen failure, then I had to return the replacement for a screen failure (and a refund).

In between the returns, I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support.  The manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff.  I also had problems with Windows (Network Bridging, I think) that further complicated things.

For the brief time the two units worked, I was pleased.  The picture quality was good, and once running, I had no problems with the software.

I take a lot of digital photos.  This would have been the perfect compliment.

I gave the Memory Frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, I was pleased with the quality of the display.

Too bad I couldn't say the same about the quality control."	0
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :).  This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point.  Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP.  I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems.  I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual	1
"The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens.  So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out.  As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful.   I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.

Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight"	0
"This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 

I use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8D lens and on my 18-55mm lens. "	1
I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.	0
This filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses.	1
"I loved this camera when I got it.
But after three months the lens would not close.  It makes grinding noises,
the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again.  
I am very disappointed in this camera"	0
"If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the ""Last 4"" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active ""picture happy"" family"	1
The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems.  HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM.  Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment	0
I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal	1
Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it	0
I went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes.  It's amazing	1
"Well. I was convinced the FX07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months. Like a lot of other reviews have pointed out, the noise level in low-light condition is annoying, and give you a watercolor-like effect. Some pictures I took during a visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium turned out completely dark (to prevent this beforehand, I even took photos of the same objects using several different settings, only to get the results of bad, worse, and worst). The picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old Sony cybershot T7. I was totally disappointed. If not for my T7 was broken, I wouldn't even wanna use this camera. Even re-sell it to other people, I would feel it's like a crime.

After revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews, I realized I must have got the defective item from Amazon. Well. What can I say? It's been 6 months. 

Bottom line: Just be careful when you received this item. Do some test shots. If anything looks suspicious, ask for a replacement. After all, all the high praise here can't be all wrong"	0
These cameras are as simple to use as any I have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much. Great Buy	1
It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it.  Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one.  Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue. 	0
The quality is definitely great. When attached to the S3 IS, it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. If you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography, I suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood	1
the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture. it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk.	0
"I use my Canon 10d mainly for Astrophotography. Most of the time, 
it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of 
time, anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. This ACK-E2
adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a 
drained one, while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my 
house. Continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash
storage. The package included several AC power connectors which is 
very useful while travelling. Amazon provides a wide range of items

I used to have an Canon Elura 70, which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer didn't work so I decided to replace it with the Elura 100 only to find that Canon had discontinued the Elura line. I really wanted an Elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models. So as a compromise I purchased the ZR 850 which has a 1MP CCD, not a good as the Elura (1.3MP) but better than the other ZR's (.640MP). The video quality wasn't bad but the motor noise was so loud I couldn't believe it. I returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad. This isn't a minor hum in the background I'm talking about, its a full-on whine! I also found the ZR camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing. Luckily I could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned Elura 100 that is much more satisfactory. Its a mystery to me how Canon can produce two markedly different cameras (quality wise) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one	0
Compare to the Price of the product I highly recommend to any one who own Canon EOS camera...	1
I really like the size and weight of the camera.  It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead	0
I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
The camera is decent. The fact that it doesn't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable.  What do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it	0
This is a fabulous and reliable camera. Feels solid. Fantastic pictures. Easy to operate. A new D40 has been announced over the past few days, but its lack of an LCD display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended Nikon DSLR. Expect prices to fall as the D40 becomes available	1
Watch out they will not ship it for 40 days after you buy i	0
"I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good.
The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a ""pro camera"" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy.
The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50.

The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse.

If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice"	1
I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it	0
"I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only ""40% better"".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage"	1

I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product	0
"Aside form the fact that Canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic, the remote switch does work well.

Overall, a ""must have"" addition for anyone interested in long exposures, images with excellent sharpness and depth of field"	1
"HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this ""Deal"" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!"	0
It is simple, handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. But I am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... This wired release would be the choice only if you are not a Digital Rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button.	1
"I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.

"I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability.

I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up.

Don't think twice. Just go for it"	1

"Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens. 
Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment"	1
I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...	0
"This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

"From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens.  I was not disappointed.
pros:  very sharp lens with very good colors
cons:  vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty
For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price.  It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens"	1
"This camera is a decent enough camera, compact, easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent.  The battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour.  I acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so I never worry about running out of juice.  I have only two complaints really, one minor and one major. 

The minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen LCD viewfinder. I find I need to use my reading glasses to see what I'm doing.

The major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the iLink cable (not supplied).  I have never persuaded it to work.  By browsing various camera fora on the web I am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other Sony models.  The computer will recognize the camera in USB mode (for capturing still pictures from the memory stick) but does not see it at all when plugged in via iLink (firewire/IEEE 1394).  All indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly OK.  Sony tech support, both web chat based and phone, have no clue and because I am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it.   

If all you want to do is connect the camera to your TV to playback the video you take, it's a good camera.  If video capture an editing is what you have in mind, buyer beware. Because of this, I can only give the product 2 stars, other wise it would be a 5.

Update:  I installed a new Firewire PCI card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again.  I also tried the camera on my neighbor's Mac (on the theory that if a Mac won't recognize it you really know you have a problem).  The computer still won't recognize the camera.  This camera has been used very little and definitely not abused.  It was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem.  If you buy this, make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it.  Don't wait like I did because I'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed"	0
This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low.	0
"I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users.

Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully. 

I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H."	1
"Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up ""bricking"" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon"	0
I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed	1
"The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too"	0
I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
"I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon"	0
"The Philips Digital Frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that I've gotten.  The resolution and picture quality superb, and the sleek outer design is an additional plus.  Also, the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord, which is very convenient. 

As another reviewer said, you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want.  It would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a BlackBerry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to.  

Also, I would like to see Philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well, that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the USB flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card. 

Thank you"	1
I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.

After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality	0
The battery is great, but Amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery, plus a mini-dv tape and a carrying case for the same price.  The case is useless for the ZR series, but might come in handy for some other purpose	1
"I bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  I didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  As soon as it was turned on I had the following problems:

1) Five seconds after I turn it on, it always says ""USB Connected!""-- and I don't have a USB cable inserted into it!  This also freezes the device.  I found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted.

2) I cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  My computer does recognize the USB device, but when I try to copy files over to the frame, I get a ""path is not found"" error.

3) I thought I could live with the above 2 problems if it could JUST SHOW MY PICTURES.  So I used a card reader to load .JPG files onto a CF card at 400x300 resolution. When, I plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as ""Invalid"" when I try to view them.

Emailed Coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying: 

""Coby Tech Support to me
5:25 am (3 hours ago) 

Hello,

We have received your inquiry. It appears that your unit is defective. Return the unit to the retailer for an exchange.""

What an inconvenience and disappointment.  I will be buying a different product"	0
"It's well designed, the protection is very good, but you should know it's pretty compact, you can put only the camera inside, nothing else.

Also take care about the color, it has some pink on it, if you are a relly macho and worry about it, better look for options"	1
I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all.  Overall don't waste your time and money	0
What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth.  They are perfect.  Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still	1
"I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. 

I have now had 3 different brands of 8"" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.

I have developed the following list of features in my ""ideal"" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.

Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3.
Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.
Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too.
Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)
Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.

Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. 

I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.

The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)

The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.

Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos."	0

Be careful ordering this item - make sure it's the right one for your camera.  While it says it's for the A95, it isn't.  While it doesn't say in the header that it's the LA-DC52C, it is, and the A95 camera requires the LA-DC52D.  I had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one.  I purchased the wrong one based on amazon's direction when purchasing accessories and don't want others to make the same mistake	0
Have had good luck with these batteries.  They last for a long time.  First time with Amazon and it was a good experience.  Will use them again	1
"If you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. It is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (Or for a beginner in photography or a child.) You have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. Also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.

The only thing I like about this camera is it's size. It's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag...

Anyway, I'm buying a better one soon"	0
I love this camera the first day I received it I took 3 rolls of film.  It has been the best purchase I bought this year. I got a real good price on it and i received it fast!	1
"We just bought this camera to replace our miniDV JVC-DVL500 that was bought in 2000. 

In short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is VERY grainy and dark. I applied the workaround listed above, but found that I had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that I needed which caused a VERY jittery image. 

The quality of this camera is something that I would expect for $200, needless to say I am returning this camera today"	0
I am really satisfied with the purchase of this camera. Good quality workmanship. Canon has been a leader in photography in my book. Easy to use controls for any one	1

"I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera.  I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots.  The winding mechanism is easy to use.  Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember.

"  This camera is perfect for me I have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film. This camcorder is small enough that some days I have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go. Also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed. 
  The settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use.
  It takes really good video's an pictures although Ive not taken alot of still pictures because I like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip. This camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc. Ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go. 
  The battery does not last a long time so I recommend a couple extra, there pretty cheep here on Amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your PC for any lengh of time.

"After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a ""snap shot"" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR.

"I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows.

I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card.

Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size.

My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers.

This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away"	1
I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. There is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. The zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so I don't recommend doing this. Look for a better case for your new camera.	0
"I going to write the for non techs out there...

I can use it, my wife can use it, my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. It is just that simple to use. You do not need to know anything about taking shots, other than how to zoom and pick the right settings, and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them.
One other reviewer said to get the following:
1. At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go
2. Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger
3. Case

"I bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste.  The camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. Nothing is a simple ""one step"" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children.  I was so frustrated setting it up that I didn't bother giving it to her.  The software installed okay but was also far from ""kid friendly"".  I wish I would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. Ironically, the reviews I did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids.  I believe you'd be better off purchasing a ""regular"" inexpensive digital camera for your potential ""shutterbugs"". "	0
"I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it. 
It is a fixed lens model, but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need.  It start up fast, zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to.  It has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want.  It does macro.  And it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised.  
So far I haven't come across anything that it can't do.  This is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital SLR yet. "	1
my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back	0
For the price paid, this is a great camera.  Should last me for a long time.  Debated buying a SLR, but this seems to have all the features of an expensive SLR (actually it is a SLR, just no interchangable lenses) and a lot easier to use	1
"At least if your going to decieve people about the LCD screen in the back, AT LEAST make the picture quality decent.  I mean this barely qualifies as a picture.  Some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light.

"I am only an amateur photographer, but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an SLR film camer costing a lot more, and a lot more complicated to use. I caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. My latest before this beauty was a simple little Canon SureShot 3mp. A great camera, but this camera has the same simplicity, but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than I paid for that camera four years ago!! This Panasonic Lumix has a Leica Lens, which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin Leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. The long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog, but if you want an all around 35mm-12X camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses, like me, this baby is for you. It only looks massive. It is quite lite and manageable. I use it for bird photographsy, but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. Don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? This is the answer. I love it, and I think your will, too. Easy to use, and easy on the wallet. If you're not quite there, try the next model down, with the same focal length but 6 mp, for a couple hundred less. Another terrific buy. No, I don't work for Panasanic. I'm a retired print editor.

This camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  After purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  The computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  It not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  The instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  Even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  Unfortunately, I have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to	0
"It works as specified on my Sony HDR-HC3 HD camcorder. I have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs/distortions using this lens. 
Its a little pricey, but well worth the money"	1
"First, I want to defend this camera's lack of an LCD viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point.

What's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it NEEDS to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button.

This product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  As it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is NOT intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and THEN you can take a picture.  Then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN!

Oh, and did I mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you MUST use the flash?

Clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  Heck, MY digital camera is easier to use than this!  We never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, I knew this was going back to the store ASAP"	0
I am a busy mom of two young children.  This camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments.  I love the fast cycle time. I love that I can take multiple pictures in seconds. Would recommend to anyone	1
"This was a waste of money.  My 5 year old loves taking photos.  She uses my digital camera  sometimes.    I  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  She could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  This was not the case.   The LCD does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. If the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. I think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  My daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months.

Well worth the $170 price tag"	1
Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE	0
"Being in Hawaii, I spend plenty of time in the water...so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity.  I have been very happy with the results, shooting in the water (snorkeling, etc) and above the water (surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens).  Some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing.

I treat things pretty roughly, and have been using this for about a year with no problems.  And I am in the water with it on an almost daily basis.  I like being able to use all the features of the camera (minus downloading images or changing the battery or CF card) while the camera is in the housing-something you cannot always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-Canon manufactured.  Everything mates up cleanly and works great, I am very happy with my purchase.

Just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay, and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use"	1

"I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances.

I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach"	1

On the HDR-FX1 I found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting. That helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me.

"Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made.

The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at.

I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions.

I did notice that the display ""freezes"" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots.

The images are clear and large. You have the options of full automatic, various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes.  

At work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product, so I took my camera in to demo. Using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but I don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. In less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail.  As a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens.

I totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder"	1
"I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras)."	0
"When I purchased this camera I was really conflicted on wheather I should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera.  So when I decided still and found out the Canon PowerShot had a video feature, I was pleased but had very low expectations.  BOY WAS I SUPRISED!  This camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics.  And the quality is awesome for both!  There is a video email option so you don't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email.  But if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment.

"I purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website. I had been using a Nikon Coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years. We plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos, but for now, this camera is an excellent investment. Easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad, but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena.

I've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos...I'm really surprised. I began using ours after I had my son, so many photos were taken without a tripod, one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos...and none of the images turned out blurry. I have taken a few photos of my son now that he's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my Nikon but turn out crystal clear on the Sony. 

The movie mode is a real plus. I'm actually on this page today because I'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind. We have a digital video camera, but with plenty of 1G memory cards in hand, I'd rather record action with this camera--the quality and sound are worlds better.

This is a lovely little low-cost camera that's suitable for a wide range of users.  I love it"	1
"My hunting buddy purchased a Nikon 800. My intent was to put him in the shade. That Nikon kicks the crap out of my Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000. Tried new batteries, tried bluffing, even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards.
My opinion is this product is not worth the postage.

Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.	1
I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product	0
I gave this camera 5 stars because of it's awesome features. This camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera. I love this camera. I think it takes awesome pictures	1
"This microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the Sony HDR-HC7 video camera on most websites, including SonyStyle.  While the microphone may be of good quality (I didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the HDR-HC7.  The microphone does plug into the MIC jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (Note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  After nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a Sony Technician, I learned that there is a ""jury-rigged"" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  Otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  The Sony technician finally admitted that it was "" curious"" that Sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  If you have a Sony HDR-HC7, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MICROPHONE!"	0
This thing is great I just got it for a trip to Seattle from Hawaii. (I know opposite) But I was afraid when I had this default battery that came with my Canon ZR 500. (which ONLY last 45 min.) But this one last at least 3 hours I love it. Best buy for my camera so far, completely worth the $$$$	1
"I ordered this mic after having to return the ECMHS1 (because it was, in reality, totally non-directional).  Well, this one actually IS directional, but it is such a pain to use I wish I never bought it.

1st of all, you should know this mic does not work with the ""smart shoe"" available on most Sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe.  Therefore it is battery powered.  This may seem like a minor problem, but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video, otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery.  Believe me, at some point you WILL forget this.

Not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it isn't in the way.  (In my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use.)

(As you might expect, I highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible.  Of course, that means the mic doesn't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe.  It's a great feature.)

Finally, while the engineers at Sony have done some amazing things over the years, they weren't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic's battery.  This cap will fall off with even the slightest touch.  This can be INCREDIBLY annoying.  Mine fell off several times - fortunately I always managed to find it.  I finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it (doesn't look great, but at least the color matches).

Considering the high cost, this mic is a really bad investment.  While the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic, this is a VERY poor substitute."	0
"We canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks.  I wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it.  

The Sports Pack is completely water proof (up to 7m).  I've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry.  

The case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. It is relatively simple to operate and assemble. You have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case, so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used.

My only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area.  So far I haven't had any problems but I've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs.

All told, I'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water I would recommend this case"	1

"It is rated for 5 meters but I took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop. The antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. The microphone records sound well. I have a High Def cam and the S.Pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. In the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive, and by experience I recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling. There are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole. I would say a 14-18 onz it fine.
It is a great item"	1

I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend	0
For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. I think this is a must have for camcorder owners. My VHS family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy, so I see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return.	1
"My husband bought me this camera for my birthday in May 2006.  I loved this camera.  Well, it stopped working on Christmas Eve.  I used it that morning with no problems, put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening.  When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures.
After talking with the customer service folks, I sent my camera in for repair.  It was under warranty, and I had not done anything to break the camera.  Well, they voided my warranty stating that it was ""Impact Damage"" and my repair bill was $111.00.  You have got to be kidding.  I called to question the voided warranty since I had not dropped the camera.  The technician I spoke to explained that ""Impact Damage"" could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse.  So I asked to speak to a manager.
I am sorry, but if I am going to spend this much money on a camera, I expect a little better quality.  I have called and email the Kodak Company several times to have someone talk to me.  Nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails.
I would SERIOUSLY think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera.  I have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it."	0
"In short, I love it. 
The XH A1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need.
It is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros, and the manual is not consumer oriented.

The picture qualitity is, so far, the best I've seen in non-pro cameras. The 3 CCDs at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular. 


The 2 external XLR connections are the reason I looked at this camera. If you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic, this is the camer to do that. Just make sure you read over the XLR connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. A set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. By the way, this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where I always needed a mic, a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing.

The downside to this camera is really only that it does NOT contain an HDMI adapter. Sadly CANON did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (HDMI-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to Fry's or Radio Shack to get another one. :(

The other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080.  Their new CANON HV20 ( a 1CCD camera due in April 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me.  But then I'm the guy that will get a 10 Megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :)

The bottom line, don't get the Sony FX7, get this one. The Sony seems and is easier to use, but it doesn't have an external XLR jack, it uses 1/4 inch CCDs, and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one.

The camera is a bit complicated, but if you're willing to learn, it is a wonderful tool.
If you need true point and shoot, I'd wait and get the CANON HV20"	1
"Bought this camera to have better print pictures than what I get with the digital. I've tried using it in every mode AUTO, close-up, etc. but the autofocus never works so most of the pictures come out blurry!
My older simpler camera took better pictures"	0
"I looked at this camera the Panasonic hvx200, the sonys, the jvc 200, and even Canon's bigger brother the X1. I found this one to have fantastic reviews on DVinfo.net, a great video forum. My concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. I like tape vs the HVX's expensive storage solutions. One concern I had was, will it look like a pro camera? That is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent. 

As soon as I opened the box I was in love! This is a really substantial camera. Especially with the opt wide angle from Canon and the matte box provided, this does not look like your mama's camcorder.

I really like the manual controls, so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. The layout of everything is great. I really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. Holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very, very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned. 

Only down side- and it is incidental. The matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. That helps with weight, but I worry about breaking it. Some may say that HDV codec is not as good as DVCpro, but my eye does not see it. The colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light.

If you are looking for point and shoot, this is not your baby, but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it"	1
"I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated. 

My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague!"	0

"Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up ""bricking"" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon"	0
I got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke. It is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures. Its also very sleek and small	1
"The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too"	0
Started to by a less expensive bag last January (Dec. now)and I'm shure glad I didn't.  For the money this bag is a good one. It's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly. The tripod holder on top has been real convenient	1
"I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon"	0
"I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for ""cute,"" but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures"	1
"I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.

It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.

Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month."	0

I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...	0
"I bought this for my new HDV FX1 Camcorder, and it works great.  Unlike the Century wide-angle lens, this is fully zoom-through.  Lens is .8x, which is less than the Century and others, but just about right for HD--since the FX1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out, this just gives it an extra boost, converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm.  Also, very little barrel distortion.

In all a great lens.  Only drawback is that it's a big (heavy) lens, but then, hey, it's for a serious prosumer camcorder"	1
I received this as a Christmas present.  This digital camera works fine for still shots, pictures of my family, etc, but for action shots, kids playing outside, basketball games, etc. it is a BIG disappointment.  I took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping. I've taken to several games/activities to try it out. I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked.  Many of the shots are blurred, have shadows (because of movement), or are so dark the people can't be seen.  I wish I would have known this before I asked for this camera. 	0
I recently purchased this camera.  It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs.  I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures.  This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected.  I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me.  No regrets with this purchase though.  Also, buy a larger memory stick.  The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another.	1

"I purchased this camera so I could photograph wildlife on hikes.  I needed something that was not too heavy, was image-stabilized, with telephoto power.  This camera meets all those requirements.  It does have one problem, however.  In bright light, the viewfinder blanks out, so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed.  I have solved that problem to some extent, by pointing the camera at the object, and letting the autofocus do the rest.  This ""fix"" has resulted in many excellent photos.  Like many other small cameras, the results tend to be contrasty, and I modify this tendency in photoshop"	1
"I got this lens in a kit with a Nikon D80 camera.  This lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time.  Why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this?  Its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it.  It was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length.  A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints.  Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm).  I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.

"This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so 
that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical
to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens.
Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally a
responsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketing
this lens.  I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic
representative who took the matter up with ""someone else"".  The outcome was that
they admit that there ""is very little increase"" in the non-vignetted field of view
by using this adapter.  She said she would put my comments on a company-internal
problem compilation called ""customer voice"".  I can only hope it reaches someone
high enough to do some good"	0
"Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.  

Pros:
- Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge. 

- Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too.

- Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed.

- Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to....

- Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.  

- Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even.

- Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful.

- Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the ""welcome"" image sound and screen.

- Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch.

- You can change lenses and add filters very easily.


Cons:
- As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for.

- No ""action"" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually.

- Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.  

- Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good.

- The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful.

- Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.  

- Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!  



Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.  It's no SLR, but it's getting there.  And, you certainly can't beat the price"	1
"After receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera, I discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate.  For instance, you cannot access the CF card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount, Also, taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle.  This is not useable for a carry-around use.

I have it sitting in the corner of my office unused, spent good money for nothing."	0
"For years now I have been buying ""bargain"" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures"	1
"Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. The Rebel XTi with the 17-70mm lens barely fits.

So a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this"	0
"After a week of testing this camcorder, I found it good enough for daily use.  The HD2 does not come with an SD card, so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the HD2.  I got a 2GB SD A-DATA and a 4GB SDHC QPI Class6.  Both worked fine.  The 4GB gives me about 1:20h in StandardHD mode, and 55mns in SuperHD mode.  I didn't notice a speed difference between a Class2 and a Class6 SD card using the HD2, I think you should be fine with an 8GB SDHC class2.
My first impression of the camera is how small it is, however it may not fit in a jean pocket.  It turns on very quick, you can start filming within 2secs of startup.  It has a lady voice telling the mode you are using (ie camera mode), not sure if this is useful for others, but not for me.
The video and still pictures are great outdoor.  The video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight.  In a room lighten by a 60W equivalent fluo light, the video quality is grainy/noisy, this has been confirmed by other people as well.  The High Sensitivity feature (to boost the image quality at low light) helps but not enough.  My 7yrs old Sony DIgital8 does a better job at 1lux.  I noticed that video quality is grainy at low light, but 7MP still picture quality is very good for the same lighting.  Compared to my new Canon SD800 at 7MP, it is obvious the Canon Digital Camera wins.  On the video side, I played with several configuration, ISO setting, white balance, resolution, etc... It does helps, but the video is still grainy at low light.  This camcorder has not been designed for low light filming.  
I ran into an issue when transfering the video & Pictures from the HD2 with its cradle to the PC via USB connection.  I got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle (this will freeze the HD2).  I am not sure why, I have to check with Sanyo on this.  If you connect the HD2 directly to the PC (without the cradle), the transfer goes smooth.  So there is an issue with the cradle and USB port.
I am also using Pinnacle Studio 10.5 for my video editing.  So far, I have not been able to use it and control my HD2.  You can however copy the files from SD to your PC, and use these files with Pinnacle Studio.
Since I film most of the time outdoor during daytime, this camera does the job fine and video quality is great.  I would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light."	1
This is a poorly designed camera case.  You have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures. I expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot. I was very disappointed. This is rather a leather box than a camera case	0
"The ZR500 and other low-end Canon camcorders appear to be very fine products, well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos, have a look at the RCA Small Wonder.  

Simple, rugged, totally easy to learn and operate, no frills but still some very neat features, takes perfectly adequate videos of your children, your dog, whatever -- and about half the price.  Bought one; totally satisfied"	1
"I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras)."	0
"This case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera.  Definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one.  
The only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720SW camera - since size is one of its strongpoint"	1
"Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up ""bricking"" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon"	0
"I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon). 

The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly."	1
"The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too"	0
I am not a professional photographer. I just happen to be a grandson of one. I use a fully manual Canon TX SLR for my work. So far I've shot 5 rolls of this stuff. Every time there has been something wrong with the camera/me/lighting. Every time I got a usable, and sometimes, great print. This film has a huge exposure latitute (you can really screw up and still get an image) When I show these prints to others, they look at me funny and say, &quot;This is ISO 400?&quot; It has REALLY fine grain. And because it's ISO 400, you can use it for almost anything (I got usable prints after shooting a soccer game: My camera was set at ISO 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door). It's a great film, although I'm told the Royal Gold it replaces is still better. Pick up a pack of this and see what you get. You'll be amazed	1
"I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon"	0
I've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far Kodaks treated me the best. If your out to capture rich, vibrant colors this is the film for you. So far I've shot 4 rolls of it and I'm amazed at how much the colors stand out. Its definatly the film I'll be using	1
I purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a USB charging cradle that would not work.  This is terrible, terrible quality control and I will never trust another casio product.	0
"This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its ""Bright Capture"" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick. 
Overall I am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere"	1
After discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case, I did some more looking.  What I ended up with was a Pelican case.  For those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop, and they most likely carry them.  They come in many sizes and are simply an airtight, waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches.  The inside is solid soft foam that you &quot;pluck&quot; to fit what ever you want to store in the case.  I purchased the 1300 for my Finepix 3800.  The case easily holds the camera, battery charger, mini tripod, and 3 XD cards.  They come in 4 or 5 colors, and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage	0
I can not find anything negative to say about this camera.  I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim.  Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera.  Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use.  The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera.  The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  Highly recommended	1

"I bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her.  It's quite easy if you're already computer literate, and the controls are very user friendly as well.  The software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic, but for someone like my mother-in-law, it works well.

Wish I had a docking station for my Nikon."	1
I was completely fooled.  Twice.  My fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for Christmas.  So as I slowly open the box, I see a pair of socks on top.  There was more underneath, so I start opening it further and there is a camera case, a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box, the HP Photosmart M525 Digital Camera!  I was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own.  No more borrowing from my sister when I needed to snap a few pictures.  I put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures.  To put it bluntly, UGH!!!  The first thing that I noticed is that, even in best picture mode, the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions.  The second thing that I noticed is that the pictures are distorted.  There's a slight fisheye effect (Imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door.) which is quite annoying.  I talked to HP Support (Someone who spoke very poor english I might add.  What is the deal with that?) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model.  Guess what?  Same problem!  So after talking to HP once again, I am returning this one and getting a different brand.  This is a horrible product. My sisters Kodak that I bought 3 years ago is a far superior product.  I am very disappointed.  HP needs to put out a better product, and have some customer support reps that speak better english.  It gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood	0
The Philips 8-Inch Digital Picture Frame is an excellent, high-quality device.  Very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device.  No need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you.  Everyone who has seen ours loves it.  It looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent	1
The camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.Everything is great in that(perfect picture and easy to work) but in that package as I saw in amazon add, the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it won't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating...be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not.	0
This is a FABULOUS gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures.  Just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable, probably since the product is new.  Don't bypass their software to load the pix if you're transferring from your PC to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one. And even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same, it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time	1
"As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk.

From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist.

I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place.

And Sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? They are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.  Guess I'll be buying Samsungs or Canons next time around.

Are you listening, Sony?"	0

"There is currently a known issue with many of the Sony Camcorders.  This is being called the ""black screen of death"".

What happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the CCD goes out like a light.  The camera will not take video again.

Sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support.  The fact is Sony does not stand behind their product.  If this happens to you, Sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.

There is a lengthy thread on CNET on this issue.  Search for Sony black screen.

"I have had this camera for about a year.  It has been nothing but a problem.  First, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  I have spent HOURS trying to fix it.  Still has bugs in it no matter what I do. 

Secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  How do I explain the problems I have had?  There are so many.  The camera misfunctions continuously.  Sometimes it does nothing at all.  Other times the zoom lense will not shut.  You turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  I sometimes can not even shut the camera off I gotta take the batteries out to do so...if I can even find batteries that work in the camera.

Honestly, I call tech supoport and told them the problems I have having and they tell me that only Kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  SO I went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  The camera salesman told me that Kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  I believe him.  So my camera which would not work...I asked the salesman to help me out.  It did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. He popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  Well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  My camera now does not work with either batteries.  Probably only Kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe Kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me.

I personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  Really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  I am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know I gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  Trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  STAY AWAY FROM KODAK CAMERAS!  If you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews."	0

I bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  Money thrown away!!  The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	0
"I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy"	1
"We never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new.  And one day, the lens just won't open.  It lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically.  Called a up a Kodak Service center and they gave me a quote for repair.

The price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in Amazon!

I'll never buy a Kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs.  I do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point.  So I'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.

My adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.

Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting. This lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. If you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. If you stay zoomed in, it works ok. Disappointing"	0
Excellent quality/price/speed of delivery... works as expected... Would definately buy again, from this vendor, if the need ever arose.	1
"I bought this lens for my Canon PowerShot G5, and because it requires the use of a long adapter, not only does it cause terrible vignetting (that circle the other poster thought was cool, but which is actually a design flaw) unless you zoom most of the way, it blocks the built-in flash. I have owned four Canon cameras over the past 15 years, and the G5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (I would have bought the digital Rebel when it first came out so I could use my EOS lenses, but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).)

I do not recommend this lens or any of the G-series digital cameras from Canon. When I've got the money I'll be buying the latest digital Rebel and upgrading some of my old EOS lenses, and selling my entire PowerShot kit. If you are an experienced photographer, you will not like this system at all"	0
"Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter.

After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera	1
"I don't know what case others got, some have said ""too tight"" but mine was very loose. The camera is swimming around in the case, easily half a centimeter of clearance. Not recommended. Just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case."	0
"I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera.

I've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints I've gotten have been great as well"	1
"Rated one star for the lack of value.

"We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons. 

We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store). 

We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich. 

The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).

Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs ""moose"" and it takes very good pictures."	1
"I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price.

I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less.

I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price"	0
"At 10mp, this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures I have ever taken with a digital camera.  The clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. The display, although pooh-poohed by others as too small, is quite large to me. 

The cameras small, lithe design is another selling point.  Nothing bulky about this camera. You can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to. 

Do yourself a favor and get this camera.  You won't regret it."	1
"This was my second camcorder- after a Canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise.

Great little package! Small, compact, fits easily in your pocket. Took them to Giants Stadium to use from my end zone seat. Able to see action very clearly in the opposite end of the field. Easy focus for my bad eyes	1
"I agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" defect on their JVC GR-xxxx. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs."	0
I like this small thing. Work great and cheap	1
"I bought this to replace my broken Digital8 Sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the Sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this JVC, on one single criterion: the near-infinite hard disk drive storage. This was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled.

Summary: infinite recording time, disappointing image quality and control for the price, painful editing. Not for the average iMovie user.

Positive points:
- the storage capacity: a dream. I thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation. Actually it took me months to fill them. Mostly because, as with digital cameras, you can throw away all the bad takes at will. I decided I'd keep all my previous good takes until I really would need the space, well... I still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder, which means that I can always show them at friends and family on location, even if I don't have my computer or DVD copies on me.
- the size, weight and shape: perfect. You can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions. It's small, feels rather rugged. I added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery, which makes the camera 50% bulkier but still manageable. The shape is great, at least for my hand size. I can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness... The microphones are not that well placed though, and I often cover them with my fingers.
- image stabilization: very good. By chance I shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way, which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness.
- ease of connection: the USB2 link is OK. I'd have preferred firewire, but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files. BTW, this allows faster-than-real-time transfer. A firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great...

OK points: user interface, reaction time (even if it takes a long time to get ready), optics, battery life (with the 3 hour batt. - actually a 1.5 hours).

Negative points :
- Image quality: considering the price, image quality is disappointing. Frankly. The viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low, and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as I found out after shooting for a whole week in Yucatan. Clips shot on my digital camera (Canon IXUS 60)  look better. There is also a lack of control on image quality.
- Digital camera: simply forget it. My phone takes better pictures. I'd advise you to buy a 2Mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals.
- File transfer and editing: pretty horrible with the originally supplied software. In marketing copy, MPEG2 files might seem nice as a target format, but we always have to edit our videos, and this is quite painful, whatever power-users might tell you. You are in for hours of conversion, except if you burn your raw takes, at the risk of boring your audience.

I was going to write ""don't buy this if you are a Mac user"". This is NOT iMovie ready. I have both PCs and Macs, it's equally painful and disappointing, except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite.

Still, if you have a Mac and an Everio get yourself the wonderful MPEG Streamclip free utility from Squared 5. It allows batch conversion of the Everio .MOD files into useable formats. You'll have to buy the MPEG2 component from Apple first and change the .MOD extensions to .MPG prior to conversions. Time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it, as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the JVC-supplied software.

Neat thing: leave your computer at home
Though you can't use the camcorder as an external hard disk (it is write-protected) you can copy the photographs from the SD card to the hard-disk, which means that with the Everio, you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera.

Conclusion: given the choice, I won't buy this camcorder, mainly for the below-par image quality, as I'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing. But I'd seriously miss the storage capacity"	0
"I needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera, so I ordered this one and could not be happier with it.

It has all kinds of features, including some manual control options like white balance, etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (I'm more of an Auto person, myself).  I used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures, after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera.  The camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started, and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera.  The movie mode works good, too.  The colors come out bright and vivid.  The lag time between pictures is minimal, which is one of the main things I hated about my old 1.3mp Panasonic Palmcam, and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures.  The only bad thing about the camera, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called), so it can be prone to shaking, especially when you zoom using the digital zoom.  I like that the camera is small and lightweight, but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half.

Overall, I think this is a GREAT camera, and I don't think you can find a better camera for the price"	1
This is a good charger - quick and portable.  But the battery life of the battery SUCKS! 	0
I have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy. It has both point and shoot, and slr features. You can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography. The software was easy to use, easy to set up, and it works well on my Mac. It has the quality the you would expect with the canon name.	1
I got this charger with my SD110, and within a few months, it stopped working; it was obviously a battery problem. The battery isn't the best quality either, but when I got a new one, the problem persisted. So obviously it's the charger.	0
I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work. 	1
I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	0
The Canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements, whether they are sand, rain, pool, or ocean.  For use on the beach, while snorkeling, or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing.  If you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands.  These weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing.  The kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing's buoyancy.  I prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by Canon.  I'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use.	1
It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them	0
With these weights I was able to send my Canon Powershot S70 to the bottom of the Atlantic, and I have great faith that they will keep it there.  Reliable, and more professional than a brick	1
"The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me...""Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally""  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  ""That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens""  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck"	0
This camera works well, except that the shutter speed is a bit slow. The image quality is decent. The use of AA rechargeable batteries is also convenient. The camera is pretty sturdy. I've dropped it a few times and it still works fine	1
"I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with ""high power"" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN ""NIKON EAGLE VIEW"" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!"	0
Outstanding service.  Product as advertised.  Excellent packing job. Arrived in record time.  Would buy again from this seller	1
Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones	0
"Product is working good and clarity is fine.
But I found the next version product (with remote)
cost lower than this product."	1
"If you are going to lay out $500 for a camera, you should expect a fair amount of camera.

However, I have a few gripes here.  First, there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough.  All the Nikons in the D series can use a wireless remote.  You can buy an underwater case for those magnificent Nikons so you can shoot underwater.  You can get over 10 megapixels in a D80, or D200 and you get that great Nikkor lens.  You don't get much of a lens on the DC500, and 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images.  Lets face it: this is an expensive point-n-shoot camera for a tourist, not a serious camera.

Nuff said.

"I just got my new photo box today.  I was so excited I opened it at work.  Then I took a picture of my wendy's salad just to see how it looked.  The quality of the pictures are excellent(macro mode).  Light is evenly distributed.

Caution about the lights:
The lights get really hot really fast.  Untouchable within 2min. after I turn them on.  I suggest for the shear sanctity of safety, shut off the lights between object/scene changes.

The package arrived intact, the box was beat up a little, nothing major.  When I opened the item, I noticed the Camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom.  This could've been a bad/weak stitch, or may have happened during shipping, but nothing major was wrong, only that.  Besides, I can sew it!

Overall, this is a great product, and is easy to setup and carry around.  I'd definitely buy again"	1
"Sure my Canon sd-30 is super cute and I get lots of compliments on how small and sexy it is, but heaven forbid you want to take pictures with it!!

This camera cannot take pictures in low light AT ALL!  Every picture I've taken at parties has been out of focus, which adds up to a lot of hazy photos of great memories.  I took it back to the camera shop and the guy said I had the setting right but ""yeah, they don't work well in low light.""  Well if I needed a bright sunny day for every shot I could make a pinhole camera out of a cardboard box!

The pictures it takes in daylight are nice.  But anyone who wants a tiny little camera like this is planning on putting it in their pocket and taking it to parties!

I got the Sony Cybershot 10.1 and it takes GREAT pictures in low light.   Later, Canon."	0
It's a wonderful piece of equipment.  Love it.  Wish they made one for larger objects	1
"If you like to take pictures with macro lense, it sucks. I've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality. If you get closer than five inches, the pictures messes up.
I've had no other problem with the hardware, though I hate carrying around that dock and it's odd shaped charger. No other charger cable in the world is going to fit! So loose it and you're screwed.
oh, and night photos also suck. BIG TIME, even with the flash on"	0
"I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with.
This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video.
The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution.
I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras.
Cons:
* Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone
* Buttons are harder to find
* Software is not the best
* Wish had more zoom
Pros:
* Convince
* Compact
* Battery lasts long
* Flash is good
* Video sound quality is good
I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing"	1
Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not  hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed	0
We bought this bag for our Panasonic PV-GS400 video camera, this bag is just the perfect size, we can fit our PV-GS400, tapes, extra batteries, recharger, video cables, remote control, and even a small tripod. Has different comparments. On top of functionality is done with a very high quality. I highly recommend it, just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy	1

"I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was ""soft"" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.  "	1
"This camcorder is terrible in just about every way:

Cons:
- Unacceptably blurry video; the specs say it records at 640x480, but it looks more like 320x240 (if that!) blown up to VGA.
- Noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background.
- Awful light sensitivity; forget about recording indoors--no matter how brightly the room is lit, faces will come out too dark.  The built-in LED's don't help much (and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject).
- Noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone.
- Zooming goes in irregular steps--completely useless while recording.
- Video lags noticeably behind camera movement; when image stabilization is turned on, the lag becomes so atrocious that you can't tell when to stop panning--UTTERLY USELESS!
- When using AV-in and AV-out cables, the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery.
- Video encoding (through the AV-in cable) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result.
- The LCD display has a very narrow viewing angle; anything more than about 10% and you can't make out a thing.
- Still photos taken at the native 5MP resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven--something like a ""sharpen"" effect gone wrong.  I can get better looking pictures with my 2MP Canon Powershot A40 camera.
- The manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds AFTER snapping a picture (that's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus BEFORE it snaps); but you can't keep THE SUBJECT from moving, folks!  Welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails...
- Flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background.
- The manual is a sorry affair--only 17 pages long and doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options.
- I could go on and on, but I'll stop now, as you probably get the picture...

Pros:
- The camera body seems sturdily built; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them, as do the battery and the USB port covers.  Hmm... it's the only nice thing I can think to say about it.

Maybe a child (think pre-teen) could find this ""camcorder"" exciting as a toy, but I don't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life's moments on video"	0
I've had it for several weeks now and it seems like a great camera.  I am still learning new features. I would highly recommend it	1
Poor focus, blurry, awful optics. Don't waste your time with this one! Can't compare to the little PURE DIGITAL camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features.	0
