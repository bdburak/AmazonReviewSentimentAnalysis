I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point

I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration

I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products

The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters

Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.

The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price

No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?

Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..

Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?
Now I can't use it at all....
I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.
Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.
Buyers beware...

I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.

When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one

We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up

In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic

Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.

Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues

Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.

This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. 

Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.

UPDATE 06/12/2006
I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)

About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.

In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.

If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.

How important are your pictures to you?

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages

The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this

Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?

I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:

- It comes with a web browser that doesn't work.
- Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version.
- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).
- The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately.
- The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required.
- While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld.

Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this

i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer

I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.

I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.

To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.

I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.

For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.

Not a quality reader.

Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.

Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.

Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.

Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader

The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution

Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform

I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.  

The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.

The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.

1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.

2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.

3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).

I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.

 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!

I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.

I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.

The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.

Infocus says "sometimes this happens".

They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.

I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.

They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.

Don't buy Infocus!!!

Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since
my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at 
the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints

I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.

Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem

This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.

So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so

This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else

I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way

You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.

1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!

2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.

3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!

4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible

5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the "biamping" type of connections.

6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.

I concur with the other reviewer - Death to Sony! Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it "Competively" with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.

I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo

The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.

The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine

This thing is JUNK!!!  Don't waste your money.  I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes, then after powering it down and back up it never did work again!  If you buy one, go through the setup and if it doesn't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON!  Don't waste your precious time trying to get a $70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.

Finally, Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged. However, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES. If the product is in fact good it won't have many bad reviews, or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional. However, look up all the bad reviews for this product. They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product

I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!

This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment

Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. 

I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.

First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones
always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!

I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange

Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.

AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!

I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.

I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?

Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas?

The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in Mail-in-Rebate. Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode, SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode. How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode?

In my experience with SanDisk, I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50% of the time with SanDisk. I think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies. Don't trust it!

I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.

This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.

I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.

I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one

It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was "shipped" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service

Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for

I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How do I assign a rating? As several other people have experienced, my unit is also DOA. I received it, plugged it in, pressed 'clean', and the motor started up. I popped open the cover, put in the disc I wanted cleaned, and pressed 'clean' again. Nothing. Terrible quality control.

What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty

I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25

This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap

About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in

When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.

I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?

Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..

I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn

No kidding!!  The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00.  Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late!

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages

These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away. 
Other than the smell, quality-wise it is ok.

In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment

This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price

I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.

I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.

I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.

I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.

The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk.

The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).

The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  

Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)

As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...

I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments

Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.

What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks

Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price

But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please

I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product. 

Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk.

I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.  

Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product

Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons.
However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now

No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie

These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.

I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!

Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !

Let's be honest.
This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. 
I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.
I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.
I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed. 
If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support

 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!

I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.

I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.

The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.

Infocus says "sometimes this happens".

They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.

I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.

They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.

Don't buy Infocus!!!

This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.

If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good.

Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang.

The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work

One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box.  I returned it.

Beyond that, setting it up takes time but is not difficult.  I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out

This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).

I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough

Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better

I was suppose to write to you from the weekend.
My two rear speakers just stop working, and also my

I don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system.
Pleasy me what to do.

I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried.  Completely unusable.  The software is a trial version.  Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more.  Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture.  Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy

If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.

It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.

Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media..

I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS

I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting "card error" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke

I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore.

This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano

The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.

The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine

This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.

1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.

2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant

3. It is clunky

4. Does not comke with a power adapte

i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 & 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town.  However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly.  The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case

I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!

I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all

We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.

As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.

Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..

It is absolutely infuriating

First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:

(1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.  Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond.  I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.

(2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.

(3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk".

I consider it item a waste of money

Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.

AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!

I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint

Okay,

This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly
encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are
really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. 

If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) 

They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)

Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.

If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it

I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.  

Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh

I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.

After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.  

One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.

===== One month later =====
I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good

I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill.

I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products

Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.

The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition.

Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?
Now I can't use it at all....
I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.
Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.
Buyers beware...

I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks! 
The lesson here is: " If it works, dont fix it!

I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said &quot;it IS ON!!&quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing

Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for

Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else

I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25

Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly.  It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand

Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. 
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo

This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems

The Good:
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. 

The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.

The Bad:
The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). 

In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.

The Ugly:
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.

I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.

Conclusion:
The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good

It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least

The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charge. The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each. I also have several high end chargers that don't want anything to do with the ones that died. On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A+ after 2+ years

O.k., I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now.  These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives.  I don't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is, but these didn't last being on the shelf for a little over a year.  I will never buy this brand again

To be short, the performance is less than great but OK, but I can live with that since I have dozens of them, I don't care if it runs out faster. But what I couldn't stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked, I couldn't imagine what would happen if I didn't come to my desk in time

I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed.
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be.
My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk

Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony.

There are brands I trust and ones I don't.  Sony has always been a trusted brand.  But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken.  I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase, but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product.  The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews: When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer.  I am hoping I have better luck.

I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk

Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes.

As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing. 

Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough

HP Warranty Really Sucks - Beware, Should Be Zero Stars

My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones. 

I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.

I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands.

This DVR works ok.  But when it is recording, forget about changing channels.  It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks. 
Broadband feature is nice; but USB doesn't come cheap. Its like [...].

A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so.  I have the older models (CD & Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating. 

 I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system.  I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate.

I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES, HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK. I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR. I DEPEND ON MY RADIO TO RAISE HELP. BUT, I AM AFRAID THIS ONE WILL NOT BE DEPENDABLE. I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING;

I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users.

I wish I had read the problems and netgear.com forums before purchasing this product.

Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily. This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stay visable to your computers.

Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare, and even at 3-5feet from the AP the unit is around 11-36mpbs.

Do not buy this product, find another company who stands behind there products. All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India. People on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke. Latest firmware fixes none of the problems

I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again

I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years.  While some Linksys units have worked for me, more often I have found them undependable.  In particular, the WPS54GU2 set up fine, but I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time I printed.  Not worth the hassle

I bought this HD because my Lacie (which had lasted over 5 years) crashed on me finally. So I figured I would try a different company. Out of the box this  product looked great, although it was very large and heavy. I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted. I tried several more times and it wouldn't boot up. VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won't boot up out of the box. I don't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data. Going back to Lacie

I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :&lt;..

The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks. I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised. once I got the tv up it is ok, and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should  for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady. I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks. I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement. Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating.

These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media I've EVER encountered! They're made by CMC Magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world. But not only are they CMC Magnetics, they're the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics!

The latest KProbe *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The latest Nero Burning ROM *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The program continues, non-stop, to display "waiting for media" when I use these, and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe.

Curiously, the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CD-R media (they're made by CMC Magnetics as well). However, at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware, quite unlike the Verbatims. That's why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics. (The Philips are no prize, either, but they perform minimally well).

The *ONLY* thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling.  But what's the point of labeling discs you can't even RECOGNIZE, let alone burn?

I had the exact same problems with these media in both my Lite-On LH-201AH burner and my NEC ND-2510A burner (the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media).

Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. But, stupidly, they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp. Thus, they lost all credibility!

*AVOID THESE LIKE THE PLAGUE!*

This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. 

The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.

The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost. 

I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.

Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.

I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.

If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out "paperless" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed. 

Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality.

This product is a sad joke.  It's expensive of course.  The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board).  But, whatever.  

However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.  What kind of company would sell such a product? 

And oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the DVD Inserts?  ... nada.  They're not there!

I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work

I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved, however I have fought with the drivers for days now. Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work, if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes (even with the newest updates) I will be returning this product ASAP. I'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again! 

I only wish there was a 0 star revie

This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.  
 
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday. 
 
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers."

My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address!
 
All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer

I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception.  This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up... and I used the fancy "Dipole" antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna.

The HD part of the radio is total junk.  Sometimes the audio "skips" and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired (meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs.)

All in all, there's nothing good about this radio.  Don't buy it.

de K0UNX.  I know radios.

I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago, used it for a weekend and returned it immediately.  Even in the Denver market, with lots of very strong HD signals, this radio had trouble finding them.  I'd be listening to a strong station, and the radio would lose lock, go silent, and rebuffer before coming back to life.  This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it.  I have since purchased a Sangean HDR-1 and love it.  Read my review under the Sangean HDR-1

There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. 

There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.

Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetooth
works well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.

But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really 
doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.
I don't want to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to
switch to...

First T5 lasted 6 months, then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty. This one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty. The third T5 lasted about 5 months. It's now out of warranty and won't start or reset. No - I'm not rough on my PDAs. None of them got even as much as a scratch. Each one looked like new when it "broke". The first 2 times, Palm told me the ROM had failed. I guess it's the same problem again, but I'm not spending $169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5. Good bye Palm.

Out of the box I think it's a good PDA, so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy

I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.

However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. 

If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..

The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.

Invest in batteries rather than this product.

I bought this card and the Belkin Pre-N wireless router in Nov. 2006 at a BestBuy store during Thanksgiving sale. The router worked but the card did not. I called Belkin many times. Everytime they asked me to re-install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked. I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again. Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement. I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs. I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive

I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.

This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy.  Problem is, it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting!  We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem.  So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask.  Not a great way to do it (and just asking to be seeded by bacteria), but if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm all for it, even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..

O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box. 

Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little

Not very happy with this product.
The software on the pc side doesn't work well at all.
Won't list all my files and I can't get it to update changes or new folders.

This bugger has way to big of a foot print.

The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies.
Hey I have a Xbox with XBMC on it. Get a clue, and copy some of it's functionality. It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased

I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.

  First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.  

  I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.

  I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.

  I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.

  1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.

  2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh!
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.

My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!

My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.

Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.

One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.

I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.

And I was right....I should have passed on this.  It was a pain to configure, and then none of the settings would stick.  Whenever I changed the default password, it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset.  That kind of defeats the point.  Returning this item so I can get something decent.  The money saved is NOT worth it

There's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks.  It's absolute junk.  I put it into the cassette player in my car, and the sounds were completely distorted.  The voice constantly skips, and the casette sometimes clicks.  The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing, and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device.  I've tried both sides, but still no avail.  I plan on returning it if shipping doesn't cost more than the product itself

I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad.

After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau.

Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty

I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons.  First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt.  That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve.  But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm!  I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous.  I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users.  This is unfortunately not the case.  So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17" amd up), save your money...

After having installed the unit for 43 days, the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting.  This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit "Flying"! Very dangerous!!

Tomtom would not replace the unit, as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks! buyer beware.  See the TomTom forum for description and picture:

I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?

For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a "visit" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.

So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).

I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.

I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.  

Save yourself some frustration and get something better.  iriver maybe?  Just stay away from Creative Lab products.

I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it.  It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months.  The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to.  Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC.  Customer service? Don't count on it.  So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product.

Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT!
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one

These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant. The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as "surround sound" (yeah right...) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers.

Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal.

I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter.

Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected

I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well

I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month.  It just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back.  But the replacement model "froze up" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund.  To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than 
we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  So, DO NOT order one!

I've tried over and over to try to print something.  I've checked my options, turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing.  If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them

This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!

I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  The unit has a very cheap feel, especially for the price.  I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.  Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months?  In short, this product is crap.  I might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less

Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working. 

Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.

I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution

I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.

Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was "within specifications" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.

For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.

Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.

The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.

If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.

I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.

To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where "Home" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.

The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.

On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.

In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.

I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road. 

On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. 

On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with HD (5 LNB) and the signal was low. Signal was less than 60% for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD. So I bought these to amplify my satellite signal.  They actually attenuated the signal. The signal strength wasn't improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well. It didn't matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver.

The headphones sound great--no arguement there.  However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke.  The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck.  Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.

Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times

Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010.

This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it.

After buying this product, I opened the case after few days, as I was out of country, to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices. However every time I put it in the camera or other devices, it gives error and doesn't work. I couldn't use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt,I  am not sure how I can even return it back either. Basically not at all happy with the product at this time

After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned

We bought this phone two years ago.  While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable.  The problems we've had are listed below:

*very short battery life for the handsets
*the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use
*the handsets go "out of range" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big)
*the handsets randomly become "unregistered" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)

The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years

I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them.

Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because Patricia (wife) in wheelchair and on oxygen 24/7. She could beep all phones in emergency and I would hear. First- sound terrible, second- after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls, third- phones quite often in 'searching' mode when picked up for use. Entered house to find wife unconcious and not breathing. Started CPR and reached for phone to call 911. Phone in base beside her was
SEARCHING!!!!!!! Stopped CPR and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911. Resumed CPR. Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnel's efforts. Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones, my last Motorola product

It didn't match the Acoustic Wave player I bought. There should have been also two outdoor speakers, as a promotion for buying both pieces.

The page, from which I ordered both pieces, was unclear, and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer.
 
I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player. (I know I'll be refunded the price of the first changer). But by then, the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished. I received the real changer a few days later, but lost the speakers. I think Amazon owes me the speakers, which is what the bad page made me miss

In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent.

I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems

Every other negative review here is accurate.  The video connection is horrible.  The mouse runs on a delay of 1-2 seconds and is unacceptable.  Try the competing Kensington product instead.  It's more expensive, but it works.  I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly - in short, as advertised and expected

i've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse. the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface, and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won't track right. i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn't test it well enough. unless your willing to do that skip this one, it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice. i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul. but then again you do get what you pay for :

I purchased this product and couldn't get it to work on a PC, laptop, or pda (cingular 8125). Not only does it not register in any SD/MiniSD card reader, but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well. I am currently pursuing a refund

I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent.

The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card

Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear, and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface.

Have a second Generation ipod?  If so, this is not the product for you.  After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it, so I bought the "Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster."  It just didn't fit it.  I tried, but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off:  don't do this.  I sugest making sure the product detail includes the "second generation.

We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position. Also, HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best. I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English. I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported. HP are you listening

The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking

Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...

She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough.  This "case" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either.  About 1/2 useful, really.

On the other hand....it was cheap, right?  Right?

The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear "window" to protect the screen

According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's

Does not consistently work! I have a toshiba a15 (Win XP Pro) and sometimes this works, but usually it doesn't. Lately, it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer. It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found, which forced me to reload the driver. But lately it's just been giving me a blue screen. I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues.
D-Link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver! Bad customer service!
I WILL NEVER BUY A D-LINK PRODUCT AGAIN!!

I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy

We got the hdmi cables, but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website.  The cables come without any packaging, and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website.

We have not yet used the cables yet, and we're not sure whether they will work or not

Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.

I've removed the driver, with no change.  The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and I'm hoping it will take charge.

I'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund

It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC. 
I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it. 

Very disappointing

Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux.  I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux.  My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go.  Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues.  Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box.

I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison.

The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion. 

I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but...
These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling...

I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer.  Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited.  My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.

I would not have bought it had I known this.  I have not used the GPS since I bought it.  It will probably be tossed out.

The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package.  So you don't see it prior to opening the package.  Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned.

Lastly, this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen.  The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors.  The cut plastic is also dangerous

I have this radio and it's a POS. Remote isn't very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright (will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person) and the user interface is terrible. The thing gets lousy reception and in general, there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites. They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks!!!!!!

I bought this alarm clock today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10.  I wish I had seen the reviews first.  I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options.  Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on.  The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn't stay in place.
   The clock light is pointless.  It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry.  Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions  even with the light off.
   As for the alarm, it's pretty quiet.  If you're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment, this is not the clock for you.  You'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear.
  A final note on this product: The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the battery cover slightly open.  If I close the cover all the way, the clock shuts off.  If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else.  You get less than you pay for with this model.

I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time

I had a 1GB Titanium Sandisk Cruzer at work fail.  I tried several times to contact Sandisk, including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response.

My wife's Cruzer just failed as well (the power light comes on, it is recognized by XP, and the light goes out, the system can't ID the device, so it's useless.  It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house).  I've tried front side USB connections, rear connections and hub connections.  No dice.  

I'll never buy another Sandisk Cruzer.  And I was going to order another 100 for the office.  Their loss

I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs).  It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit.  A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore.  When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution

I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet

As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right. 
I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken!

Overall, it's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials.

The buttons don't have that clicky button feel, so you press and you're like "did it go?"... The labels are hard to read, icons take a little figuring out. Honestly I use it for turning on/off, and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHome to adjust it.

My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video.  The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod.  A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen.  It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod.  A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket.  I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too

I, too, experienced the "Blue Screen of Death" on my laptop which has XP pro on it.  I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting.  On another note, the install of the router was GREAT, regardless.  

I didn't get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything.

This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT

This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day. 

Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.) 

The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash

I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's).  The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it.  I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained.  I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained.  Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.

I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read.  I adjusted the contrast but it did not help.  [...]

(that's what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2/I2 camera)all good news.I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day. I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet, that's why I will be getting more. All I can really say is byem

I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini

Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now.

This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.

I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had.  This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned.  It does not like photo paper, it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced.  Do yourself a favor - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!

The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer

They listed the 49X and they shipped the 49A(standard capacity), so like everyone else who bought this product, it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get. You may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around....

The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable.

The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems.

After reading another Uno & A-37 user's identical problem (on Amazon), I returned the Uno and purchased an Edirol(Roland) UA-25 audio/MIDI interface.  It works perfectly with all of my equipment including the A-37

The shape conforms perfectly to the designer's hands, but unless you share the same DNA, I'd avoid this product. I've used many of these over the years and this is the only one I struggled with. Constantly shifting it to get it's high and low points in a place that was tolerable. I finally reversed it, pointing it towards me and it worked a little better. This just needs to be a simple pad. Instead, they've overdesigned it as a gimmick.

I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:

The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.  

All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.  

So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.  

I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again. 

By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.  

Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.

I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.

Jeff

I agree with the other review, Sony brand VHS tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years.  As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations

We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.

-In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.

-It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!

I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key

What were they thinking? Or Are they thinking at all? Sonic Stage is a piece of crap. It freezes, hangs and very very user friendly???? Since you need their software to load the music, I would stay away from this player as far away as possible. 

Pros: Nice sound quality. 
Cons: Everything else. 

My recommendation is go for Creative USB players. It's very good quality and better battary life. With Creative players, you just drag and drop files and you done with it.

I see why Sony is failing in MP3 players market

The software to this MP3 player made it too much work. Anything that freezes up my computer has to go. 

Here's my experience.

I purchased this player on February 23rd and returned it to the store on March 8th. I was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. I installed the software with no problem, but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. I just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. I did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. It had a very nice sound, easy to use and wonderful to carry around. I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge.

Fast Foward Week 2

I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to "re-authorize" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files.

In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the software I would have kept the player.

I have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others I tried had much better sensitivity. You have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd. There are better choices even in this price range

I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  Today, March 6th, I am returning it and this is why:

The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.  

All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.  

So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.  

I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again. 

By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.  

Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.

I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.

Jeff

Got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall, I need to purchase a $4.00 part and pay $5.00 shipping and taxes.

Now all the specs say wall mountable, not wall mountable with an extra purchase!

Ok, $8-10 isn't going to break me, but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall!

So, since I can't mount it on the wall, I haven't used it yet! 
Have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in...

Ok, so this is probably not the best protection for your iPod, but what do you want for 6 bucks? I'm cheap. If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps...

Pros:
- It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely.
- The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it.

Cons:
- The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers.
- The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck.
- It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries.
- This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top.

If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it

The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best. If you enter the CF ID incorrectly, you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the CF card. Beware

I went online to Amazaon, a site I trusted, to locate an HD RADIO for my desk at work.

This was listed as an HD radio; only after I received it, opened it, and plugged it in did I discover it is NOT an HD radio.  Both the 3rd party vendor and Amazon claim I have no right to a refund.  The FCC calls this fraud, and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation

I liked the MD671 for the home office so I thought the MD7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone. Not so. The handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking. I tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem. If you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable, right

Rarely do I write a review but this product is so bad I had to.  Expecting Sony electronics to perform well, what a disappointment, this one is a bummer.  Save your money.  There has got to a better under cabinet radio out there.  While the concept is good and the design sleek; don't be fooled by the packaging.  Nothing works well.  FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive.  To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted.  Forget listening to the rest of it.  This product is really ZERO stars.  I've tossed the whole works in the garbage

Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods.  Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated.  Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system.

All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod

I ordered this for Christmas from a Marketplace Seller. It was defective and assumed I would have to deal directly with Philips to get a replacement. After seven weeks, I still do not have a replacement from them; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days, and I have no recourse. I also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if I could, or even get the unit. I would not recommend buying this or any other Philips product to anyone. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. I also had to pay the shipping to return their defective DVD player

I had read several reviews here before purchasing this product, but went ahead and bought it anyway, thinking that Logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted.  I was wrong.

After a few weeks of satisfactory use (long enough to get past Amazon's reasonable window for returns), the space bar started working intermittently.  Incredibly annoying, and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes.

Even before the space bar turned against me I was unimpressed with the feel of the keys (I use a Dell wireless keyboard, an Apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my IBM X-series laptop).

Bottom line - the thing looks great on a desk, and it is nicely compact, but it probably won't do what you need it to.  Look elsewhere

You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.

With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).

The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.

At the beginning, I really thought this is a very nice product. It does solve the CD organize and automatic storage problem for many people. However, this equipment is poorly engineered. I bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons. There is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units. If you ever think about move this equipment to another room, it is almost bound to fail. Customer service usually take 2 days to respond. The phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer. Imagining someone charges your $400 to organize 300+ CDs for a year and then quit. I am completely pissed off.

I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman

This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing.

I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console.

This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs.

The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections.

The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.  

There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself.

Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own.

Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output

Man, were we diappointed with this GE phone! We did everything right---"trained" the battery in the beginning, made sure we routinely charged it, never dropped or abused this phone, and then one day it started not holding a charge. We couldn't figure it out.
It worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out, just like the other reviewers have said. We had a 10-year old Toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it's unfortunate demise, which is when we acquired this loser. Are there any good phones out there somewhere???

The price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item, but after only about 1,000 pictures, all I got was corrupted data.  I had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera.  It definitely showed the card was the problem.  Luckily, I had recently done a download.  Won't trust my pictures to this brand again

In short, why a 1 Star Rating you wonder?

Took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up I doubt will ever work for anyone.  Though it does work once finally set up.
__________________________________________________________

So I decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop, new wireless router, and a wireless print server (PS), so I can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house.

I did a lot of research and decided to get a Belkin router (F5D7231-4) and this PS from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. This is definitely not the case!

First be warned this product IS NOT WPA compatible!  Thus, even though the router is WPA able, you cannot use WPA with the PS and thus have to use WEP for the network once this product is used.  Hopefully in the future this product will support WPA, but it would only hopefully do so thru a Firmware Upgrade.  Do not think this PS is WPA compatible.

Next, be warned the box says "3 Minute Easy Install" - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the PS working now wirelessly.  I am not a computer techie, but I am smart, a great problem solver, and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages.  

I tried to set-up the PS on a static IP address, as recommended by my techie friends, but this just did not happen.  Thus, next time I restart the router it may assign the PS a different IP address and then I'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so I plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue.

The crux of how I got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the MAC addresses of the PS and computers in the network.  This is the golden key I searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router's and PS's web interfaces.  Only this way was I able to unhook the LANd-line from the PS to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly.

Belkin tech support had medium wait time, friendly techs (not always speaking English without thick accents though), and they were unable to solve my golden key for me.  They even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened.

So, yes, the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that I had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than I ever wanted or expected to, and I had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work.

This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one

I've been looking for this style of phone for a while, looks great, works great but it's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use.  It's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my Samsung SPH-A900. When the Samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone. I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home.  If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women. Also it does not have any plugs for headsets.  I am returning mine to Amazon

I do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon.com, but this time as I was listening to my car audio today, I was compelled to leave one for others. This product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments I bought for mp3 player/audio system. Its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality. It does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds, resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity. Mine worked ok for the first several hours I assume. I think it damaged the speaker, and it now sounds like it's going to rip apart. Someone else left review explaing this trouble, which I ignored, which was a mistake. Again, don't buy.

This is a terrible product.  If you can get it to print, the labels look great, but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that I can find. I get an error that it didn't print but no reason why. I've installed on two different PCs, one is brand new and same thing happens.  Software is also pretty useless.
It also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive.
The online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond.

The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again

Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM

These speakers, in one word, suck.  I made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap.  I guess I forgot the old adage "You Get What You Pay For", didn't I?

They worked "okay" when I first installed them.

In a week, I got bad signals and the speakers didn't work properly.

Worse purchase I've ever made!!  

Don't make the same mistake I did, please!  Spend the extra money and get quality speakers

I own a Magellan Meridian Marine unit. Just found out that you can only get 1 access code per program. I purchased 2 64 meg cards in hopes of downloading more than 1 map per card. Not only can I not down load more than 1 map, I cannot get an access code for additional cards. Lost money all the way around.

Magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the Blue Nav XL charts at $179.00, but low and behold, they come with the same defect of 1 unlock code per program.

I was a believer in Magellan, but switching to Garmin today!

I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.  Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer.  Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand.  I think it is a much better design

Do not buy this unit.  I have tested the VoSky, IOGEAR and now US Robotics and they are ALL junk.  While the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate.  I do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit.  And why are the SO SMALL!?  The are so small as to be practically useless.  The IOGEAR unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons.

Bottom line: Wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a Polycom and the Computer Calling Kit that is available through Polycom.  (Even the Polycom Computer Calling Kit is analog!  What is the problem!?

Very simply put, the sound is wonderful - the design stinks.  I too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones - that lasted 2 days and they fell off.

I don't know what Bose is thinking - clearly they are not doing any end-user testing.

Update - Bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently don't fall off.  Pretty cool - I gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to

This is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours (but did make it beyond the very short warrenty).  It was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long.  For the price I expected a durable and well built machine. I was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it

If your router is not by D-Link, and particularly if you use WPA encryption with that router, do not purchase the DGL-3420.  I have tested it with both the Linksys WRT54G and the SMC 2804WMBP-G, and WPA fails with both of them.  D-Link technical support, in fact, has confirmed that THEY know the adapter doesn't work using WPA with the WRT54G.

Besides, for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality.  After this product failed for me, I purchased the Netgear WGPS606, which can connect FOUR items (X-Box, computer, whatever) to your wireless network AND two wireless print servers, all for $20 less (on Amazon)

When this jumpdrive was plugged into my Windows 2000 system, the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive. The Lexar "technical support" was no help at all. They told me to reinstall my system.

Luckily the computer repair person I hired was able to recover my data files before the OS was reinstalled. Lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost.

I will never purchase one of their product again

When it worked, it did as described, but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost.  Now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it.  There are many better, more reliable brands, such as the Sony Micro Vault which I have now.  Nevertheless I wouldn't put anything on these that I didn't have backed up.  These drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer.  Heat will cause them to fail faster

I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again

I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed

Ok.... I bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain... hey 5GB for less than $100 what a deal.  Once you get the hang of loading and working with the Windows Media Player its not a big deal to load.  Unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs (which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs) you get really good at it.  Had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the HD and no longer worked at all.  I thought maybe the reason was that I had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better... right?

So I stupidly bought a brand new one.. again less than $100.  This one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and I just recently got the "not recognizing the HD" message.  I am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight.  I am 0/2 with these players so I don't believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back.  Beware of this product

This is the worst pice of electronics I ever bought. Started falling apart after few days only. Battery life is a joke.
Software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it won't work with OS prior to XP. You will find that out after you're done installing it. Mediocre performance. Don't waste your money on this one.

I have an iPaq PDA and I own a TomTom GPS -- both of which work well.  This combo iPaq/TomTom is 'in the rough' and needs to undergo some re-tooling. I'm surprised that other reviewers mention what I deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star. For example, the Travel Companion stalls and needs soft-resets.  For a right handed person, the stylus is awkward.  Support is not good. Moving through programs can be painfully SLOW. The GPS tracking lags. I depend on my GPS and PDA for business travel.  Buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it's loaded with some fun stuff. But, not if you need something dependable while on the road.

I ordered the Cisco Aironet 1231 the other day, and after it arrived, set it up, and...couldn't get a wireless signal. I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router.

Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing

Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7" player) received.  

I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work?

Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product

I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static.

Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.

This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.

While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage

This player is junk.  It would not play music for more than two hours before going dead.  When I called Toshiba, the person that I talked to claimed he wasn't aware battery life was even a problem.  I directed him to read some of the reviews on C-NET, which I discovered after I bought it. (My fault) It was finally returned and the battery was replaced.  Now (after two weeks) it won't even hold a charge.  I'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone

The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.

I've had these speakers for three years now. Hissing, popping, not holding signal-- all that has been true from day 1. And tonight, one of the speakers just would not turn on. The power supply wasn't the problem-- it's something inside the speaker box, and something that apparently cannot be fixed.

So my other one will be mono until I can come up with an alternative solution.

Oh well..

We wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom.  The reason I give two stars is because of Beach Camera's return policy.  They grudgingly allowed me to return it, as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee.  I wish Amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company

The description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in "rugged" conditions. In reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber. I suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage, but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling

Has anyone else experienced the following ?: Used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems, then have run into (so far) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months. After various attempts to narrow down the problem, I tracked it down to the blank CD-Rs. I had exactly the same problem occur with another brand, which was replaced with these TDKs. Is there some unwritten shelf life for blank CD-Rs or am I just unlucky?

Creating a DVD, using iMovie to iDVD EVEN on a PowerMac G5 Quad (superfast, supergreat!) is a 4-5 hour process. A 10-15% FAILURE rate, due to POOR media quality is UNACCEPTABLE! The 'quality control' at MEMOREX sucks! 

It is NOT so much the cost of the bad DVDs, but, there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5-8 out of every 50 I have used, causing a failure to burn, after a VERY lengthy set up process. 

I will be using VERBATIM blank media  . .FROM NOW ON!

I bought the KX-TG5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it's
predecessor KX-TG5471.

The 5571 handset does not have a FLASH BUTTON!

What you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button, wait for 
options to appear on the screen and then press a different button to 
access the FLASH function and there is NO WAY to figure that out while
looking at the handset.

This portable TV sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design.  They don't tell you that there is NO ANTENNEA nor that the TV will not work without an antennea!  The portable DVD player is great. THE TV IS HORRIBLE.  When we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken.  DON'T BUY THIS FOR THE TV!  We ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in.  This one was a total waste of money

The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases. It is not much different than entering the information manually. The character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective. Does not even recognize that "wireless" is the mobile phone number. One would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years. The only good thing is once you scan the cards, you can throw them away, but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand.

Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good.........

After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.   The iMac now loses it's connection every 15 minutes or so.  

Soooooo, once again I'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land.   I purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and SHOULD be rock solid.  I found a forum at [...] that proved to me that many others are having DHCP problems with these routers.  

There's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network!  If I hadn't already tossed the box, I would be returning it for a refund.

I purchased this to work with my Xbox 360, I wanted to try this cable type with my new Onkyo 7.1 home theater since I was using the old composite for sound. I heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender. I qucikly ran to Best Buy to buy a Monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more. But then the sound was incredible I couldn't beleive what I was hearing. I gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as Monsters. (Maybe I got a bad model give it a shot it's only a couple dollars)

I was not aware until purchasing, that the U3 Smart Drive by Kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me.  However I will use it as a general back up thumb drive

I got this case for my WS-320M, which I've been wearing around my neck like a MP3 player.

The material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt.  It looks good = professional looking.

I've enclosed what I hope are representative pictures of this case.  All the buttons of the recorder are accessible.  Even when the flap is closed, the microphone/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons.  If the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone, you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well.  There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the "HOLD" button on the side of the recorder.  Not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the "HOLD" button.  However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released, if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the "HOLD" button.

The belt loop is an adjustable velcro.  I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. Most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times.

The case is closed shut with another velcro strap,

All in all, it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport.  Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in MIC, headphone, recording/playing) is set up.  The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case.  The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder.

My bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive.  Placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such.

I think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.

On one positive note, I believe this is the first time that I was the first reviewer for anything from Amazon.  Woo Hoo

I live in the Wash. DC area and we have pretty bad traffic.  I normally take a route that isn't extremely bad but does has congestion.  I get no warnings at all.

Also, recently there was a smaller side road (Non-Highway but well used road) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road.  The antenna works but Clear Channels Traffic information sucks.

Sucks really bad.  When I check the traffic information, the only information I get is the main large interstate highways.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  

Who knows, maybe the XM traffic service is better but I can honestly tell you Clear Channel Traffic Service SUCKS!

Maybe I'll get some traffic information traveling on I-95 somewhere...

Sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth

Very disappointing! I was hoping I could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate VHF stations. Instead, the best the antenna could pull in was color-enhanced snow and sound laced with static. Tried all three antenna hook-up options. In fact, my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna

Please don't be fooled by it's inexpensiveness. I am a victim of it. I already bought this card and within 2 weeks I started getting read and write errors. I formatted the card and it now has 2 MB of bad sectors.  Unlike the other reviewer I did had 2 GB to begin with. But I think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap. It is not at all reliable.  Now I am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me

This printer is a piece of junk. The print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges, the mechanism is likrly to be damaged. Like other HP printers operating under XP, it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g. paper jam, paper out). Cancelling a print job results in a "deleting document message" which remains until printer is disconnected (you can turn it off under these circumstances) and computer is rebooted. Often XP hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering. I have long had this problem with an older HP model, but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now, but alas.... The crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge. The tricolor cartridge, costing about $18 at Wal-Mart, lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up.

In sumarry: Don't buy this printer whatever the price. It would probably be wise to avoid HP inexpensive printers altogether.

I experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod. I was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my TV out signal to on. It didn't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting.

Looking at the photo of this item, I noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is NOT the screw on contraption needed for my eXplorist 400, so I was hesitant to purchase it until I did further research and found out WHY the plug is different.

You still need the USB cable that came with the eXplorist and have to bring it in the car too!

The big AC plug detaches from the USB cable, and AHA!  Now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into!   Then you screw that cable onto your GPS unit as when you charge it via AC.

In other words...  This charger does NOT plug into your GPS, it plugs into your GPS charger cable which attaches to your GPS.

But I don't want to take that cable in the car with me, because if it gets damaged or lost, then I can never charge the unit at all, not even at home with AC.    So I was forced to find and purchase another USB cable assembly seperately, to keep in the car with this car lighter charger.

Magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it.

The car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord, but what good is it?  You still have to have the long USB cable attached to it anyway!

But hopefully this will help everyone, that like me, was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that isn't going to fit anywhere in the eXplorist 400

I have no axe to grind with Bose.  I originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up.  This speaker has an incredibly small footprint.  If space is limited, this is not a bad option.  

However, being honest, this is not a great center channel speaker.  Choosing speakers is like the addage "certain horses for certain courses."  Your budget, your room, your components - all play a part.

I have two home theater setups.  One is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from Polk Audio.  The other is a dedicated theater utilizing Definitive Technologies with B&K Reference 7.1 Processing.  Clearly the Bose VCS-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup.  However, I have run it with my Polk Audio's and it was workable.  The timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my Polk CSi3 but it was not awful.

My bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker.  Can you buy a better one in this price range.  I think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system.  You should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it's not just about one speaker.  If this speaker fits your space and (more importantly) matches your other speakers, then it may be the right speaker for you

I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake.

I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth

I followed the install instructions to the letter, but the install program started giving me an error that I couldn't get past.  I downloaded the latest install from the Linksys web site and got past the point where I had been getting the error, but I couldn't get the print server to connect to my wireless network.  When I had the print server connected to my network via an Ethernet cable, it detected the attached printer but couldn't even print a test page successfully.  This product was a complete waste of time

I've had this phone for approx. 9 months now, maybe longer...and I truly don't know how I've stood using this dual phone system for so long.  However, tonight I've taken a giant step "upward" towards better quality and design with the Panasonic KX-TG 5432M dual system.  

This dual handset is the worst I've ever experienced in a cordless system.  From the moment I set it up, the static has been atrocious.  Step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear.  I can't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person.  Even within six feet of the base I receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting, not only to me, but to the other person on the other end...for they hear it too. I will never purchase another uniden product, if this is the non-quality of product they put out.  I had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system...and I wish I'd never gotten rid of it.

As the title says...If you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone, this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear. The melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep, but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head. Uniden should be ashamed of this product.

Stepping down from the soapbox now..

We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program. 
Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!

I just bought these matte labels. When I printed a photo, I noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality, and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels SMUDGE when fingers are lightly run over the labels.

Has anyone experienced this? Please share your story

Long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual FM reception. This is in town trying to receive a major station. I am packaging this up and its going back today. This is my second try with Sony that has miserably failed. Guess maybe I should be looking at another mfg

I purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their TV's to watch programs rather than listen to music.  Reception was horrible!!!  While I was in the gym I tried just listening to the radio and couldn't even get that to come in clear.  The only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies!  Not impressed at all!  I will be returning this and maybe buy the $12 generic set instead

I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things. Its cheap, 299.99 at most retail place right now and that's what you are getting. The One died in 24 hours, while plugged in and never turned back on. It also directed us to a road that was headed into the Pacific Ocean, there is no road across in the pacific last time I checked. It acquired Satelites ONCE and then never acquired them again. And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmar

It works if there's a direct line of sight to the reciever.  In other words, if the ipod is lying down horizontally, it won't respond.  You'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work

Do NOT buy this if you own the c340--it doesn't fit and Amazon shouldn't market this as if it will. It's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund.  This is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter--I hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise, you'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money.  The Garmin is great, but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem.

Disaster. Supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but WILL NOT work with other desk phones! It ONLY works with cordless phones. I wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset. We were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones. No mention of the hold 'music' in the manual. This product is a mess. STAY AWAY. Get a real phone system

After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!  Do yourself a favor, buy from a different manufacturer

If there were a catagory for 0 stars, that's what I would have rated it. I bought this model only because I wanted a TV that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter. The radio works, the CD works, but the TV died after l month. And the TV was the only part I was interested in. What kind of product is this? I would like Amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit. Carol Gruber

Basic connectivity and wireless work. Any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including VPN passthrough.  This device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle.  Please read the reviews, this is common and these problem were confirmed by my IT dept and also by D-Link's tech's as well.  On second one, all of the exact same problems.

Sad to have made a choice, hope they make it right

Had to give it one star BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER.
This printer was the answer to my printing dreams. For about three months, with LIGHT home use. Only fault at that time is it is LOUD. It will wake the dead. Which is OK, since the DEAD don't have to print things that often, this is the perfect printer for them...
Other than noise, a faulty "load paper" error kept coming up.
Then, the paper load went bad. It is very unreliable, and ink cartridges run out VERY QUICKLY and cost about 10 bucks a pop,
Tonight, I'm trashing it. Buying ANOTHER printer tonight!
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH

This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.  The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using).  I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews).  I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER

I just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere.  Unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player.  Earliest date I can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs.  I'm at a loss now that the battery is dead.  This is the dumbest idea ever.  Why didn't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player?  I agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important

Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me.  besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous.  About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down.  I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).  This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc.

Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this

I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one.

A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3.

These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.

seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception.  i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal.  price-wise, it was great.  however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well.  the directions are terrible.  they are extremely difficult to follow.  i never could get it to sync with outlook.  i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work.  i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child's play in comparison.  in this case, you get what you pay for.  don't purchase this, you'll be sorry.   Take care, it's a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly, the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much.  punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum.  do you carry the manual with you.  put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language.  truly disappointed with this worthless plastic.

I have owned the DMR-ES40V for over 6 months. It is a combo DVD/VCR unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. 

The MANUAL:  It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere.

The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet). 

DVD PLAYBACK: The general playback is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my JVC progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present. 

DVD RECORDING: Recording onto a DVD-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned VCR tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home. 

THE VCR USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying.

LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty JVC unit. 
I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere.

The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny "button within a button" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is

The product description in January 2007 is inaccurate:
batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours, not 60;
there is no hands free speakerphone;
if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units).
There is more:
the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment;
the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it;
the clock resets itself when the power is turned off.
I returned mine

This product has the potential to be tremendous, but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched. That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience, now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches.

Also, there is a big 'rhigo-skin' logo on the front, which makes the case even that more distracting.

I'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail. 

What a letdown.

P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case, it will double the thickness of your setup

This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.

However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.

Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use

I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The "mouse" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search

I purchased this because I have to do a lot of math online and was hoping I could use this for that purpose.  Also I was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes.  

So far, I'm not impressed.  The pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use.  It is actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you have to press VERY hard to get your entire note set to be recorded.  Talk about writer's cramp!

I'm also disappointed that you can't write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively.  My fault for not understanding the functionality better but I thought this could double as a writing tablet.  

I can't speak to the size of the paper since I haven't tried any other size.  

In general, a big disappointment and 90 dollars that I would have been better off just setting on fire!  Another item destined for Craigslist.

p.s. -- to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text.  Of course, that was of very limited use since the stooopid thing failed to capture my handwriting accurately in the first place.  But the capability is there..

I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body

I' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht I picked up a few urs  Don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors.  That's the kyboard, nome!!  I'mt ba to to y na o y n Acino esr I ia.

Ok, switching over to a wired keyboard!!  The above mess was me trying to type on the Microsoft 6000 V2 Keyboard!!  I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!!

I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!)

No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it!

Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.)

Better luck to the rest of you

Viewing the internet this monitor was great. When I tried to play a movie, DVD DISC, MPEG, AVI, ANYTHING. The picture was terrible. Very bad pixilation. I was told it might be the video card. I bought a new card XFX geforce 7600 gs, for another $150.00. Same quality on films. I tried latest driver from XFX, from nvidia, etc. Changed screen resolutions, everything you could think of, I tried. The picture for viewing movies was terrible. I hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up, the picture quality for movies is great. I have returned this monitor, now I have to wait for a refund before I will try a different monitor. The black light bleed is very bad. If you watch films on your monitor, you can't help but notice it.

PS. Amazon was great about refunding shipping. Amazon is the best online store there is

Malfunctions:
1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music.
2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward.
3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.

Design issues:
It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title).
It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it.
It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice.
The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones.

Good things:
I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it).
It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed.
The large storage capacity proved fully necessary.
You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).

My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks

After my trusty Archos player's display broke, I figured I upgrade and get me a 60GB iAudio X5. As a journalist doing interviews, I was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3. A friend of mine loves his player, so I didn't even flinch when I saw the price.

Ever since then I regret my decision.

Apparently my player has a software problem. It speeds up all my mp3 files. I tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing. That is when I was actually able to upload mp3s, because oftentimes I received error messages and the player refused to do as told.

So what then: Upgrade the firmware. Sure. If you can make it work and I couldn't. The description online is poorly written. But it's essentially like this: Start with a fully loaded battery. Unplug the A/C cabel and unpload the Firmware. Now replug the A/C cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware. Well all it does is conclude that the battery isn't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else.

I.e. I couldn't get the firmware to update and I tried for the last hour.

Therefore I'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund. And I'll get another Archos - and continue to live with its misely 20GB

I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing. 

Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one. 

All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in

My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it.

I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure.

Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway

I bought one of these and it broke the first day I used it.  Amazon replaced it for free, but for no good because the second one broke soon after I got it too.  Very poor laminator.  I went to Office Depot and bought one from Xerox and it works much better

The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone. Consumers Report was very wrong in their rating of this phone. The phone was terrible !

I purchased this item to record LPs into my computer thru the input on this device.  It sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop.  Had same experience with LOUD right out of the box too - startled me out of my skin!  Mine didn't come with any disk although the box mentions software.  Then again, I bought this from an Amazon 'partner' from Amazon.  Spend your money wisely and get an iMic.  I'm going to

The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though:
- The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa.
- The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none. 
- The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions.
- The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models.
- The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.

I returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. It was great on part of Amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee).

I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.  

First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with "Other" GPS units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it?  Or they haven't had experience with GPS in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing? 

For positive reviewers, if this is their first "newer" GPS and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational GPS Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the ViaMichelin has a "horrible" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the ViaMichelin is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly.  Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system.  So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it.  But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it "loses" it and you have to program the history all over.  You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how "lost" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros:

Pros:  Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life.  Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit.

Cons:  Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry.  Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible.  I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it.  Third, unlike ANY GPS I've had, this one literally tells you to "start driving" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc.  Think about that!  It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way!  Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say "NO" as most GPS will at least tell you to "turn right" from where you are parked or "turn left" but this one will say "start driving" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road.  It can't do it from a parking lot!  It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming.  It makes you "start driving" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling.  Bad software design for sure.  When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border.  Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist.  I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my  Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits.  Want to find POI's on the run?  Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years.  I'm serious.  I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts.  To be sure, Garmin, TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town.  Not so Via.  In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years.  Punch in  local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them.  Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location.  But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing.  So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store.  Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is.  It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the Garmin or TomToms.  This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's.  No GPS finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course.  But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a GPS themselves before.

I can't say enough about how "difficult" the interface is....and when you go "back" or "forward" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps.  When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be?  I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason.  WRONG!  The experienced GPS users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek Garmin or Tom Tom interfaces.  Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital.  This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital.  Which is horrible.  I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital.  

Truly, I am sad to not recommend the ViaMichelin.  I really recommend you "pass" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker.  If you are tech challenged, buy the Garmin or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface.  

But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit.  On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use.  

Finally, there is the "fun" factor.  The TomTom One is fun.  The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use!  Even the newer Garmin's are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old Garmins.)  But the ViaMichelin X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country.  Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where Garmin and TomTom shine.  The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older Garmin's use an older satellite GPS chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same GPS satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips.  But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via Michelin, cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio.  The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals.  But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use GPS in my opinion.  If you are looking for software ease, go Garmin first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last.  If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable.  But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with Garmin first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. ViaMichelin, but you need to go to "finishing school" like the other GPS students.  You are just too unfinished and rough

I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work

The PCI bus does not have the bandwidth to get you Gigabit speed.  You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a PCI gigabit card, even with jumbo frames.

Your motherboard has two PCI busses, and sometimes has three.  Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses.  You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the PCI bandwidth it can get, but that will not be close to gigabit speed, either.  Best case on 33 MHz PCI is 300 megabit.

Even if you can find which PCI bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz PCI busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card, anyway.  If you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 MHz PCI, PCI-X (not PCI Express), 64-bit PCI, or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that.

Worse yet that built-in Gigabit interface might still be on a 33 MHz PCI bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed.  It probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework

This product costs too much for being such poor quality, I can literally just pull the cord apart bare-handed without using barely any force at all. And after it's torn apart there is no hope of repairing it, no matter how much time, effort, and thought you put into it, it's impossible. I'm pretty sure that it's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another. The only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality, and their comfort. The sound quality sounds a little better than the normal iPOD earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore. But if you plan on using these while you're leading a busy, active life, I GUARANTEE that they wont last a week. I heard that these earphones are the best...I found out that they are indeed some of the worst...and sadly I found that out the hard way..

I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge. I let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results. Unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer's design, I would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'Prime Time'

I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The printer will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.) I read reviews by others, but feel this printer is simply not reliable. I wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase.

In my opinion, Canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras. I'm in the process of trying to return it to Amazon. We're going to buy an HP, which I should have done initially.

Thank you

I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net.

I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.  This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time

I've rarely had bad experiences with Microsoft mice or keyboards. Usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product.

They evidently didn't hire the "good" designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults.

#1: The shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in "the right position".

#2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). On this "gaming" mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade.

The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning.

I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street.

I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing. Calling this a "gaming" mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of.

I purchased this printer for it's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum, but it's really been a let down. The printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out. So  now I have to send 3 copies of everything I want to the printer, wasting paper and ink. I've tried different kinds of paper, and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at Brother, but it continues to do this. I've looked around the Internet, and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models. It's really an inconvenience, and now I have to purchase a new printer because it's such a pain. If you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use, this is the printer for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs

After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing.

Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there 
is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help)
This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD. 

I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure

Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.  

You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.

While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to "turn it off", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!

I have a 42" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!  

I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP

I would never buy this TV again or a Samsung product for that matter. I obviously purchased a lemon, have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck. Samsung initially told me I would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when I called back I was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period. How's that for sound logic. 

I really like it when it works, but, unfortunately, an important aspect of a TV is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button.

Specs look good. HDMI 1.3a, 1080p, firmware upgrade over Ethernet, etc. The unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built.

However, Toshiba chose to ship this HD-DVD player with only a composite A/V cable (yellow, red, white RCA jacks) in the box. The best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i, and not even as good as an S-Video connection for that!

It is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and HDMI 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or HDMI) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an HDTV. I don't know how much cost savings Toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5.

Now let's get to the real review:

Pros:
- One of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular DVDs to 1080p. The upscaling is very high quality. The unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered DVDs.
- If the weight of the unit is any indication, build quality is high.
- It has an Ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality)

Cons:
- Very slow boot time. Takes longer to boot than my Windows XP PC.
- Especially durimg 1080P HD-DVD playback, the unit gets very hot. Make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. There is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player.
- This player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic DVDs, so you have to use your TVs scaling function. Kind of  a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers

I bought a PV-D4744 about a year ago,
It worked for a while, now it won't read old disks and, 
even with brand new disks, the chance of
it being able to read the disk are not good,
about 90% of the brand new disks I have tried
it won't read. 
I will never buy another panasonic product again.

Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too

Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an "isupercharger" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along.

I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours.  The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely.  This thing is garbage!

Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity

The product was shipped to me in Moscow. After the first charge, I took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours. Upon returning home and recharging the device, I discover that it will not turn on anymore. I suspect the battery is charging as the LED indicates this as it is connected to AC power. However, disconnecting it from any power source, it appears that the AC outlet and USB ports no longer function. The device gives no auditory signal or LED message, so I don't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it. Either way, I'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 Watt solar panel anyway. I strongly suggest getting the battery from Tekkeon. Sorry about the bad review, but I had my hopes for this device as well.

I sent it back. The price was right but the caller ID didn't function. When I got in touch with AT&T, they told me, maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home. (Stupid Response!) I then asked, why would AT&T put a phone on the market that's not compatible with my other phones, I didn't get a reply!!! They wanted to send me a replacement. I told them there is no point in doing that, if, the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones! I guess AMAZON will be sending it back to AT&T

Its a good accessory for Archos product, I have 604 wifi. Its compatible with generation 4 Archos devices. 
Pros:
1) Good build
2) Enough connections to expand

cons:
1) It very much costly as compare to it utility.
2) It comes with charger which should be a part of standard item.
3) There could be more cables included in this package like SPDIF, USB Mini cable.
4) In this cost it could have a backup battery (extra) that could be part of (built in) the Docking station, so that Archos device can have longer play time. 

I think Archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can, if it is then it would not go a long

I purchased one of these radios before Christmas and it works great.  I decided I wanted another for work, so I ordered  another one.  

I recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the "preset" weather stations are off the mark and the only thing I can pick up is distorted and garbled.  They sent me a replacement and it too is off station.  At this point, I'm wondering if the first one I got was the exception.  I do NOT reccomend this product unless you just want an am/fm radio, that part works great.

This will be my last First Alert purchase unless I can try it out first!

I LOVED this printer!!  The print quality is truly phenomenal!  I had a few issues with paper sizes, too many pieces being fed through, the rear feed slot, same as other reviewers, but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful.  And yes, I am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer, because it is DEAD at the ripe old age of 13 months!  Exactly ONE MONTH after the 1-yr warranty, my printer is "unfixable".  And HP won't do anything for me... after speaking to 8 people on the phone (only one of which I understood fully) and 3 supervisors, they just said that I'm SOL... So, yes, very nice printer, if it lasts

I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.  
When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.

I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades.  I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last.  After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems.  Any scratches that they have only make it worse.  I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK.  All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time.  So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones

This is not an xD to Compactflash card adapter. If you order this item number, you will receive a PC card adapter that accepts xD picture cards and SmartMedia cards and fits your PCMIA 2.1 slot on a PC or Mac. It is not for a camera or substitute for a Compactflash card. There is nothing compact flash about it. The product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon's website

Does not work with non-Apple base stations! I had a PowerMac G5. I was told by Apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless G access points. But No! At my house my PC can see no less than 6 wireless AP's (some from neighbors, one mine). But this Airport card can only see one (which is an Apple Airport Station)! Tried everything ( Googled, set encryption modes,  slow downed my LinkSys WAP tranfering bitrate to 2Mbps etc...) and no luck. Returning it tomorrow

I am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are!  I really did enjoy the ease of Tivo from Pre-HD days and wanted to go back from my Comcast HD DVR.  I then saw the pricetag and, unlike the other people... I can NOT justify spending that much money for a DVR!  It is definitely not worth it for something I get for $8 extra a month attached to my cable service.  Yes... i do love the Tivo interface and searching, but I will not pay that much for it.  It feels like business suicide for Tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price.  Knock $700 dollars off that retail price and I might change my mind

A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.

It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.

Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes

I was very disappointed when I got to South America and went to curl my hair and nothing happened.  Take a look at the product specifications.  It has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts. I had two different curling irons with me - one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts.  I am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for.  Take my recommendation.  Buy the converter by Tumi instead.  It is twice the price, but it is one piece, easy to travel, and works with many different types of appliances. I am very satisfied with it.

Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary??????? 
Secondly my receiver is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, surround left is silent as it should be.  Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be.  Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. If I select the different output options, basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing. 
I am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as I do think the receiver is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well.
I major concern is something is wrong with there HDMI circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. I will update when I get the replacement installed.

I bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system.  I based my decision on information as stated on the Pioneer web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered.

This receiver does have a number of good features, but has one serious flaw.  It will not display on screen status messages for daily operations, like volume and sound mode, unless you have a Pioneer display, and run another special cable from the receiver to the TV (As a side note, Pioneer needs to understand we want to run LESS cables to our display).  That means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-Pioneer TV, which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver, and very infrequently after that.  (The set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs, and audio calibtraion.)

Sounds like a small deal, but in many home theaters, including mine, the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.)  This not uncommon, many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors, and it means I have no idea what the volume is, what sound mode I am using, or anything beyond the set-up menu unless I go into the closet. BAD, BAD, BAD!  This seems to be a marketing ploy by Pioneer to get you to buy Pioneer TV's and projectors, and it is beyond stupid.  If this was not the case I would rate this receiver much higher, but it is a SERIOUS flaw.  It makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult.

This limitation also means, if you have mulitple displays, I have a plasma TV and projector in my theater, you need to run thier special cable to both displays, and both have to be Pioneer.  Again, I have to say BAD, BAD, BAD!

The other features are as stated on the Pioneer website, but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display, and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems, unless they have a Pioneer display with SR+.  (Oh yeah, your Pioneer display has to be also be equipped with SR+, thier way of linking the two units.  If your Pioneer display is not equipped with SR+, you are again out of luck.  Did I mention this is BAD?!)

25 Feb 2007 - addition to reveiw:

I called Onecall and they will take unit back, but at 15% restocking fee, plus paying for shipping both ways.  While Onecall really did nothing wrong (Pioneer is lying about the OSD!), it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud.  Buyer beware from Onecall, thier customer service on this one was not good

Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going.

Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution

The Sony MDR-IF3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear.  Perhaps, if one were an elf or a small child, they would fit properly; however, if you're like me, a mere adult mortal, they probably won't fit you.  

They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description.  If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie, the SONY MDR-IF8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money

I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista.  As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me.  The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling.  As others have noticed here, Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem

I've been using this remote since it was released.  Better than any others I've run into, but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too, be prepared to give up a couple of hours.

When it's working, it's a 5 Star device, however...read on as to why I give it a 2.

As I type this, my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support.  3rd call today.

I simply got a new PVR.  Programmed OK, but it isn't the default device when I watch TV.  Also, it took two calls to find out my DirecTV PVR is not a PVR, it's a "satellite".  As a "PVR", it couldn't be added to Activities because "you don't have a device that will change channels".  News to me.  Never known a PVR that couldn't change channels.

Literally, 4 friggin' hours so far and it still not right.

At some point, the TV suddenly stopped turning on.  2-3 hours on that issue and it's still not right.  TV does not go on until I hit the "Help" button on the remote.

To add insult to injury, I can't access the website.  Enter my email as an ID and am told it's already in the database.  I ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized.

I hate that the software doesn't have a simple "Home" button.  You have to go through several menus to get back to it. 

Hold time now up to 52 minutes.  I have to hang up for an appt., so the hold has to be repeated....AGAIN. 

Oh yeah...I also dislike the size of the buttons, especially the numbers. Cell phone sized. No doubt designed for a dainty child. 

I could go on, but if another comes out with a product like this one, I'll be looking hard at it

Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours.

After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave.

I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to ....

Thanks, Logitech.

I have the same criticisms as many others.  I had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment.  After turning it off after the first use, I couldn't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store.  I loved the size, but I bought a nice wireless by Microsoft; not a mini, but easy to use, a battery compartment that opens without difficulty, and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically.  Take it out, put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again.  Price was comparable, even though I pay a lot more for these items, living in the Caribbean.  Amazon does not ship anything but books, cd's and dvd's to the Caribbean

if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit:

it can only read 1 card at a time
needs specific usb power requirements (needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb) else you will get "USB hub power exceeded errors" the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v... and still didn't work
the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down
from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized...

contacted support... service there = average/not so good (support forum has several topics complaining about this product)

couldn't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired, can't send the unit to ultra because currently I'm outside the US and as i stated customer service is not good.


bottom line

don't buy this item

The Sennheiser PMX70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others I'd used recently. I had high hopes on first listen. However, these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes. I later took them on a 40 minute run. The design is such that in any position I adjusted them, the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear. Once I started perspiring, my sweat poured right into the little speakers. I had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces. The right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run. Who designed these? Consider these headphones only if you 1) never plan to exercise while using them and 2) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less

I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed.  First, I coudln't get a connection to the router.  Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.  A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!)  Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box.  Don't buy this product!  If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there

I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.  

I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.  

This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless

Everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it doesn't come with the USB cord to hook the printer to the computer, and that IS a LITTLE important.  Also, I have Windows Vista, and the printer is not compatible with it, I have to download a patch, but that was my own fault.  I guess you get what you pay for..

This unit satisfies in its GPS functionality, but is problematic elsewhere.  When I decided to purchase a GPS, I decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone (Motorola RAZR V3).  The bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes, even though the 6000T would still show the unit and phone as connected.  Customer service was no help.... it seems their script only includes the instructions "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).  

Second problem:  the unit started turning itself off randomly (actually, it went into "Sleep Mode") while driving down the road.  The customer service response?  You are correct.... "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).  

I finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair (at my expense, of course).  I received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired.  Their solution for the unit randomly going into Sleep Mode?  They turned off the power management so the unit would not go into Sleep Mode under any circumstance.  Well, I suppose that IS a solution, but a pretty crappy one since, if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle, the GPS battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car.

I expected MUCH better at this price point.  Shoulda gone with Garmin

I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.  

My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.   

Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.

Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.  

So in summary the current Lexar encryption software:
- Can't be used on a Windows domain machine
- Can't be used on an Intel Mac
- Breaks the DVD on a PPC Mac

It's not for me!

However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay.

In my opinion: 
I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better. 

In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06. 

I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either. 

I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer. 

I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report. 

It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need! 

You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were. 

I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition). I should have bought on Amazon.

I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.

PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important. 

CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.

This is a cheap cable in both cost and quality. When connected between my Voodoo3 3000 card and my Mag Innovision DX17F monitor, the picture quality was poor, with severe &quot;ghosting&quot; of the screen.  This cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do.  I assume the  lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality

My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one

These speakers are big in size but short on performance.  Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them.  They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub.  These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes

This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk. 

The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device.

This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared

I spent two days tried to have it formatted by my Powerbook G4 and set up a wireless network to replace my Microsoft wireless router.  No luck.  It is on the shelf ever since. People at the Genius Bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel.

To set up other routers with a PC you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars.  Not Apple. 
 
If you don't have time don't buy this product.

I got this for christmas 2004.  Played 5 DVD's on it and started to get the &quot;No Disk&quot; reading.  I only had it for 1 month.  I sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model.  We will see if it has the same problems.  According to reviews of the 1700m model I expect the same.  I suggest you spend a little more money and get a better DVD Player

I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it). 

What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system

I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.  I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii.  However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself

I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone.  I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait.  Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount.  The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem.  He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one.  I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days

When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number. Unplug this extender, and the PC is assigned an IP number by the router without any problem. A brief power blackout will cut IP numbers to your wirelessly-connected PCs. I purchased this particular D-link range extender because I wanted to ensure that it works well with my DI-624 router. I wasted my money buying this device. It's useless, and it's too light to even serve as a door stop..

I have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others, so I can say:  Just get yourself a better wireless router.

Based on the reviews here, several online fora, and my own personal experience, I can confirm to you that you have about a 30% chance of actually getting this to work, and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another.  But why bother?

At this point, there are higher-power routers, high-gain directional antennae, and there are even products sporting 802.11n, which inherently has a better range that -a, -b, or -g.

If you've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs, research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power--I would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network.

I understand that my suggestion may be more expensive, but I am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth.  Definitely hours (if, by some miracle, everything works on the 12th or 13th try), and probably a couple of days (assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one)

This device is much bulkier than it needs to be. But an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod. The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod. It is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too

Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.

If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one.

They won't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and I should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works.

I've had this scanner for 6 months now.  It worked OK the first month, but since then it loves to "eat" paper. It scans multiple pages at once.  For example, a 20 page document, becomes 15 pages one scanned.  I have to scan the same document multiple times (sometimes up to 12 times) until the scanner finaly scans each page. It gets to be very frustrating, actually, it's the worse piece of office equipment I ever purchased. Otherwise it works fine

The "LP-to-Digital Recording system" is nothing more than a record player. Just a vanilla, run-of-the-mill record player. You still need a sound card in order to record your LPs. Most builtin (on the motherboard) sound cards have very poor audio input, so this product is not suited to its advertized function.

I am reminded of the "solar clothes dryer" product of a couple of years back - the box contained a rope and some clothespins.

The software is awkward and hard to use, not at all intuitive. It also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy. Any buyer would be better off getting Audacity (freely available on the net), which is easy to use and has the same features.

I do not recommend this product.

This Linksys stuff simply doesn't work. And don't try getting technical support - it's a complete waste of time. If you can't Google the solution, just take the stuff back.

The adapter install took out my TCPIP stack, even for my WIRED connection. It took me 3 full days to figure out that I needed to remove any sign of Linksys, Odyssey, and Funk Software from the registry, then remove and reinstall the TCPIP stack. Linksys support couldn't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days, a dozen emails, and 5 separate phone calls.
Linksys support is just embarrassing. Don't be caught having to depend on it

I have purchased the card for my 3 years old Toshiba laptop, which has a wireless card (b) so I thought it is time to go faster. I have connected to various access points with it,but for the first  week I could not get it to connect to internet, so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all. After installing the latest driver i connected to internet, however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop's card it is very very slow.Plus, it did not see some of the networks, which i could see with my laptop's card. The Tech. guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help.
I am very disappointed.

I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work

I had the TX-SR304.  Everything sounded great.  However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound.  Sounds almost like a record scratching.  The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme.  The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise

Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund.

I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. 

The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. 

I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. 

I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).

The sound quality is fine if you are in range.  The dual headsets work as advertised, in other words:

1.  You cannot talk on both phones at the same time (instead, you can transfer a call to the other phone).
2.  The range is not great (though I have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft)
3.  The voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none.

Other than that, it's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household

Make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying. Apparently, they work fine with Sony camcorders (the packet too says so) but not with Canon. Also, it's incompatible with my new Panasonic camcorder too. Interestingly, it was displayed as a combo offer when I bought my Panasonic camcorder, which is the reason why I bought it anyway, but got duped

When outsite temperature is around 0 Celsius degrees or below, and the car and the unit it's not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange, it gives sudden false alarm like K 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5  0 0  0 , Ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm. And sometimes when on the highway , from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller . 
the spiral coil it's not good to short , you need a straight one 
maybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9

but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality

The Apple Remote is included with the iMac G5 and works great with it and Front Row.  However, for the iPod, it's almost useless.  The lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling.  In short, don't buy this remote, look at other non-Apple remotes that are more full-featured

This antenna is too directional dependent. Almost always I have to re-adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel. In addition, if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks, forget about this antenna. Given most of the previous reviews, it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings

I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...

I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.  This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA

I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs. 

Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money

I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next

This cable looks nice, when you don't linger on a digital channel.  What happens to me is that if I leave the TV on a digital channel overnight, the next day it will be a split screen mode, showing double image of the broadcast.  To fix it, I have to change it to a non-digital channel and switch it back.  I guess it is possible that it is the cable box, but nothing happens like that on the Component outputs

True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions.

On my couch the mouse is dead.
If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive.
But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky.

Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse....
I am returning this product.

Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen.

[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better.

I've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light. So I was happy to find this one. However, with my first "Eagle" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough.

I have this setup with my new laptop that runs Vista premium.  The device installs ok and it works with media center.  

It's great for watching tv, but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in "standby" mode until it's time to record, you may be disappointed.

When coming out of standby, sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not. When it's not recognized, I have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized.

Because of this, I have missed several recordings.

I contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby.

Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B&H Photo and Video. I have both the the DL-150 Pentax Battery that came with the camera and the Impact IMDL150. I can't tell any difference between them other than the price. Camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices.

Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website  it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- .

I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included.  However when it arrived, there was no battery.  Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries.  I asked how the battery could only be worth $5.  He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers

I love the idea of this product, and I loved working with it. I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen.  But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy.  My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems.  More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.

Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap

Functionally, the iFM is great. I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV's. However, the construction is extremely cheap. I bought two of them and both fell apart. One fell apart the second time I used it. The construction is so cheap that I couldn't put it back together because the controls don't line up. I wish there was an alternative but I can't find one. I like being able to switch between iPod tunes and FM, but will have to carry two devices from now on

When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth

Camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as Dlink recommends. I bought from Ebay new and Dlink refused to replace or repair. So beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or Dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired. Think twice about buying Dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid. Need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty, from unauthorized seller, or buying used.

I'm not a system analyst, so I need really clear instructions for any new device. I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office. 
Troubles I encountered: 
1.) Set up was impossible. I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection. I wasn't willing to do this. 
2.) I could view from the Internet within my home network, but not from my office. 
3.) Had to convince one of my company's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera's system. Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure-- which worked until I had to reset my router. 2 weeks of use in one year.
4.) I have never been able to have the camera send "snap shots" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program. No can do.
5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked!
6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid &lt; $80 for an indoor camera.  

Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work. For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home, but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation.

There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality

Our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office.  After we set them up, it works just fine.  We didn't use any of the advanced features at that time.  After reading the user's guide and online forum at the Linksys web site, we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is NOT user replaceable.  You need to send it in for replacement.  Sure enough, we now have two routers that can't retain any configuration settings.  They all reset to factary default all of a sudden, one after 1 year, the other after 1 and half year.
Also note, we updated one of the router to newest firmware, which prevents any kind of connection from the internet.  Needless to say, my boss is really crossed with me because I was the one recommend the model

I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.  It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help.  While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up.  Too Bad

VERY DISAPPOINTED in this phone.  I have an early generation Uniden phone (without answering machine) that was a total joy.

This turkey has weak audio and ear-piercing intermittent static.
If you bother to look at earlier reviews, you will see that this is a common problem with this phone.

Avoid at all costs

It was time to get a new cordless phone and I bought this because it was on sale, and featured hard number buttons -- I find it more difficult to dial phones with soft, squishy buttons. Bad decision. You can't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum, the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices, and apparently no one can hear me. I plugged in my headset to the jack, and they can hear me, but I can't hear them. There is static everywhere -- you can't use it in range of fluorescent lights, TVs, computers, speakers, etc. In a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere, try that! This phone is worthless and if I can return it, I will

My Cyberhome portable DVD player worked for all of 1 day. It is unable to play DVDs or CDs of any type. Also, if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs, it will completely drain out within 24 hours. 

I attempted to get service from Cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty. Their support number is unreachable as is their support email address. Attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful. 

This would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked.

Purchase at you own risk. Check out the manufacturer web site. You have been warned

The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.

I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself

I don't want to rate this product, since I haven't used it.  I had to, though...  I just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger.  I received them, left them unopened upon not seeing a charger, called customer service (they didn't do anything about the posting), and sent them back.  A waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back.  Do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions

We need them for emergencies throughout the day- this is a farmed animal sanctuary- non-profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already.  I am willing to change my review if we get new batteries.  They came on time- they are good quality- other than the batterie

I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.

I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button

do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.  

I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the "acoustimass" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very "tinny" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.  

In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine

i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive. wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability. there's nothing convenient about its need for 2 USB slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing. nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging... if you're reading the requirements for Mac OS X you miss the bullet point in the Win XP section calling out the need for 2 free ports. Amazon's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing TWO USB ports...

boooo seagate. i'm offended that you're offering such clumsy connectivity

Do not by this product. It has several issues. Go to the forums on the Linksys website and see for yourself. Most people, myself included, have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis. This device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the Wii and Xbox360. It's SPI firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall. Even in the face of the number of users having problems Linksys has never released a firmware update and it doesn't appear that they will

This combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true.  Instead, should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item, you'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution.

As a cable gateway the WCG200 performs as expected.  Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze.  I was up and running in no time.

Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare.  None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time.  When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour.  When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds.

The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem.  I've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from Linksys.

Do yourself a favor and avoid the WCG200.  You will regret purchasing it

When we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the Cisco label. When we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and NO TECH SUPPORT!
 If you read the boards on the Linksys site you'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different ISP's and areas of the US since this item has been released. PLEASE don't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage, you'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through

After less than one week of use, I am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection.  In 5 days, I have had to cycle power on this unit, on average, more than once per day after it locks up.  The Web UI fails to respond to connection requests, it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power.  I have tried to work with NetGear technical support, but their suggestions (e.g., lower MTU) have been useless and their responses quite tardy.  If you are looking for a firewall/VPN unit, I suggest you pass on this particular product

After just one week of use and installing the newest firmware, this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot. By week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes. This now seems typical of previous experiences I have had with other Netgear products.  So much for plug and play.

My recommmendation: leave Netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and DHCP serving

This is the only card that has ever failed to work on my Palm Tungsten C, so I know it's not a hardware problem with my PDA.  The handheld device recognizes the card and FileZ shows that the programs and databases are present and available, but the program doesn't run -- the only response I get is "Loading from card. Please wait."  But nothing happens.  My repeated queries to tech support via its Web site have gone unanswered.  Don't count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon

I sincerely hope iPods have improved... I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck. 

That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have). 

I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time

After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts.
I would suggest that prospective purchasers of Belkin products hesitate before buying.. It's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly, but it's really frustrating when Product Support is worthless

I wish I had read the Amazon reviews of this item before I paid $19 for it at an office supply store. It may seem a bit trivial, but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker. It's unfortunate, too, because everything else about it is perfect: the color, the comfortable gel support and soft fabric, and the size (it runs the length of my Mac keyboard and provides support when I use my mouse). But the smell: a piercing, toxic smell that does not go away. It doesn't matter if I spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer, I still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad, and it's made it impossible for me to work. I finally had to get rid of it

I love this minisisc. It holds an incredible amount of songs--the equivolent of an I-pod mini-- and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great. BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE! Just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by $9.00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free. And you can get them at your neighborhood Radio Shack for the same price as here. I got a HI-MD recorder instead of an I-Pod and I'm glad I did. Just don't buy the disks from Amazon

Skull candy ear phones do look nice...but it stops at that. Within 2 seconds of putting them on, they hurt. The things are HORRIBLY uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid. The sound was ok, but not great...and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up.
Yes they do look good, but head phones should sound great and be comfortable, looking good should be a bonus....not the entire sales point. I am very disappointed in Skull Candy. If you want good ear phones for a reasonable price, go for Sony or Senheisser. If you want a fashion accesorie...go with skull cand

I have 8860dn - it based on the same engine as this one, the only difference - wireless.  So here is my experience - hope it will be helpfull.

I was with HP for 15-20 years, needed MFP, read all reviews here and decided that MFC-8860DN will be a good choice (other option was HP 3055).  It has everything I need - copier, network print, scan, fax.  Easy setup (I am in IT for 25+ years).  Everything was almost perfect.  The only complaint you need to keep in mind - IT EATS 1100 WATTS when starts printing - light could flash.
It was OK, until I reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3".  No problem - need to clean everything (per my experience and confirmed on Brother's web site).  Cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page.  
Called Support 2 times.  After few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace DRUM.  Hey - its only 1500 pages, nowhere close to promised 25000!  After I mentioned it, they offered me 75% discount on it.  What's about warranty?  Sorry.  I spoke to supervisor, he explained that Support in Philippines can't do it, the only option - to call USA office.
I replaced DRUM.  Now counter shows around 2000 pages and I have same problem again.
Hey, I heard this before - never say never.  Still as of today:
I would NEVER, NEVER buy Brother printer/MFC again!!!

Let me start off by saying like some others out there, Theses seemed like a dream come true.  Got my First PAIR( yes i said first) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard.  They sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected.  I was saving in the meantime for the AC-1 soundcard that goes w/ the head phones.  One day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead.  DOuble check with oter PC's and verify bad headset. OK no problem amazon was great with the exchange. got my 2nd pair in a week. I decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up.  got the card for my B-day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound. Plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a IRQ conflict i believe. O' Well just bad luck i guess.  Sent it back, again amazon very good about it.  Soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have EAX or X-fi which alot of games use.  Today i got an email saying that Amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well. so there you have it. Razer seems to have issues with it's production, thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing. Amazon was great and I'm Happy they didn't just ship me another POS

So, I bought this a couple months ago.  At first, I was in love.  Great sound quality, and the surround sound aspect works well in FPS games.  Also VERY comfortable, much more so than any other 5.1 headphones I have owned.  The initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly, though.  

First of all, the microphone *sucks*.  I've seen better microphones on 20$ radio shack headphones.  These are GAMING headphones, and expensive ones at that.  You would think the microphone would be at least passable.  It isn't.  

Secondly, the build quality is pretty bad.  Within a few weeks, the control brick started giving me problems.  The sound would go off on one side or the other.  A bit annoying.  This only happens sporadically, and can be "fixed" by squeezing the sound controller.  Not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement, but annoying nonetheless.  

I've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws -  screws that aren't properly inserted, and they have a tendency that fall out. Now I have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone, and I can't find the tiny screw.  So I'll have to either try and repair it myself, which means trying to find somewhere I can buy tiny rare screws, or have to send it in for repair.  I might as well send it in for repair, because maybe they could also fix the volume controller...

Really kind of disappointing for supposedly "premium" gaming headphones.  The microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or TS.  And the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price.  I bought some 5.1 headphones for 40$ a few years back...  they only lasted a year, but they had none of the issues that the Razer has.  Kind of sad that a cheap Chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap.

Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card. 
Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.  
If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800 & 1900 series cards.

This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating

Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles.  If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you.  The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard.  So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back.  My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster

I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle.  They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music.  That didn't last long.  The connection would not hold and if I didn't hold it together, the music faded out. Also, music faded in and out from ear to ear. I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less

When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.  This DVD Recorder failed miserably.  No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug).  Nice editing features if you have the time.  Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back).  I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it

I bought this DVD recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format.  Plus, it's a Sony, and I've never had any problems with Sony before.  The recorder works intermittently.  It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time).  I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and "they could not duplicate the issue" so they sent it back.  The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows.  I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!!  Now the door is jammed and I can't take the DVD out.  Don't buy this product.  I'm buying Samsung from now on

Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.  (I have the majority of my songs on Itunes

I'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if I had used it; I have found Samsung products to be very good.  I did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my XM Satellite Radio Subscription.  I already am paying costs for two radios.  I purchased this item to have more portable capabilities, but I did not want to incur an additional charge on my XM account.  Consequently, I returned the product without using it

Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging.  I purchased them at a local Office Depot.  It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center.  Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought.  I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund

For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it:

1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note.

2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children?

It's going back...

Claiming that this fan's "3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air. On high, it still doesn't move much air, and is incredibly quiet, nearing silent in my opinion. If you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads, this is NOT the fan for you. The 3-speed switch is useless, as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high

This stuff is great.  My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains.  It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time.  The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off.  The printing will "wear off" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack.  However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary.

BTW, if I did not have fingernails, I could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip.  There ought to be suggestions from Brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label

I purchased this product to share my DVI monitor and Logitech Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between my two main machines - the exact use promoted by the manufacturer.  I successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping, but am extremely disappointed with the DVI video at 1600 by 1200 (severe streaking and noise), and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise.  BTW, I am using Belkin KVM cables.

Don't even THINK about purchasing this unit

Warning: This unit has flaws that can render it useless. 

My intention was to share my DVI monitor with my USB keyboard and mouse between my PC and Mac.  Simple enough, this unit fit the bill according to the specs.  However, as soon as I hooked everything up per the directions, the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop.  I had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about.  Alright, 20-minutes Googling for support lead me to the conclusion that I needed to perform firmware upgrade.  WARNING: DON'T DO IT!  

Attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from XP will most certainly render it a paperweight.  There is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails, and it will under XP.   When I tried the update I the utility reported "tramsit error."  Note the spelling on the word "transmit" - that is how Belkin spells it in the utility.   If they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader, what chance is there the code is quality?  Anyway, that was the kiss of death.  The unit was dead and had to be sent back for RMA.  Unacceptable!

I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It is the WORST.KVM.EVER

Not worth one star! Lasted about 1 week, and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town. It is now officially DEAD and USELESS. Even the short while it "worked" it was almost useless. Switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible, the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible. DO NOT BUY THIS. Don't even THINK about it.

I bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown iPod earbuds, hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation. I got both. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass-heavy. Furthermore, they were quite painful in my ears the first several times I wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection, often leaving me without sound in one ear. 

Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones, particularly if you're looking to buy in-ear headphones.

I bought the Terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some AM and FM radio stations I was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system.  Perhpas because of my apartment building, or the quality of the stereo, the antenna didn't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna.  I did notice improvement in the static (or lack of it) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well (they went from great to excellent), but the stations that were tuning in &quot;poorly&quot; got no better with the Terk antenna.  Overall, it was probably not worth the money paid

I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are:
- Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them.
- Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture.
- Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out.
- Software is a pain to use.
- Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.

That being said, I still use it. There are some good features:
- Long battery life, recharges super quick
- Very cool-looking player
- Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size. 

I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.

The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.

Purchased this TV December 10 after much research. Unfortunately for me the TV was defective on arrival!
When it is working it is a very nice TV, but the customer support from both Olevia and Target leave a lot to be desired.
Target will not replace the item... the corporate policy I am told is the item must be returned via shipping... you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up... and once target receives the TV back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued... they say within 30 days... my credit card company AE says it will take 6 - 12 weeks... All this time with no TV, paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears... I don't know about you but that is pretty steep!
Now Olevia... though it is under warranty I again must pack up the TV in the original box, ship it back to Olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me... the TV weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again I am without TV for a month or more while the transaction takes place. If I want a TV at the time the defective one is shipped I must give Olevia a $1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction. 
EITHER WAY THE CONSUMER GETS SCREWED!!
The television has a one year warranty, I purchased the extended warranty... What else could I have done!?!
I am told by both TARGET and OLEVIA this policy falls under the "other terms and conditions" ... I wonder why they don't actually say that?

BUYER BEWARE OF TARGET AND OLEVIA!!!

This switch works really well.  I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems.  When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly.  However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds.  I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.  
I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.  I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price

I am a person who actually uses these items, alot. After 2 weeks of using these headphones, the right earpiece quit playing. And I hear MS is not suppporting anything that stops operating. Also, it is too expensive. I am enjoying the Zune, but all the accessories should be a little more accessible

SONY advertised this as a 18x burner for DVD+R media. I used the recommended brand (Verbatim) and Taiko-Yuden which are very high end media. I was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder. The movies are in .mpeg format, I was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter.  Unfortunately, I got only 12x write speed with the provided software, in a mac as well as in a PC. (Just slower than advertised, no clusters).
It is a noisy drive too.
I spoke with SONY costumer service and I could not get any satisfactory  answers. I had to wait a long time to be helped. They said that the drive was probably damaged. I returned it and I do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive.

I bought this to work with my eMac/700.  It met all of the system requirements given.  What wasn't said was that it wasn't supported by the Mac's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the Toast 6 lite.  In other words I couldn't read or write disks from any other application on the Mac.  In fact it would immediately eject the disk when I quit Toast.

Luckily, Amazon took it back.  They even paid the postage.  Unfortunately I'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office.  Additionally,  having found a new "hi tech" way to fib,  I'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from Amazon.  I blame Sony for this.  I know Amazon can't check out every manufacturer's claims

Usually I discount negative reviews.  I think people may have sour grapes against a company, or not understand how to install or work something.  I somewhat tech savvy - I installed our wireless network that took a little doing.  I work as a technical recruiter, so technology doesn't intimidate me.  I like technology.  

So I had been nudging my husband for a print server so that I could print without going to the printer and plugging in.  He came home with this Belkin product and went about installing it.  Usually I like to research before I purchase a product, but he wanted to handle this.  

So, he installed it, and I went back and checked his work, and he had followed the instructions exactly.  I know he had some trouble, and had called tech support at my suggestion - I would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support.  The only problem is, that the printserver doesn't work.  

So, I tried installing the software on my pc, and trying to problem solve from there.  I called the tech support hotline back, and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time.  I waited for 2 hours, then went out to run some errands.  There was still no message from a technician when I returned.

This morning my husband needed to get some work done from home.  He created a document, and knowing that the print server did not work, he wired up to the printer to print that way.  But now, the printer won't respond to the signal, so he can't print that way either.  So we deleted the Belkin software and rebooted the computer.  He still can't print.  

So, I went back to my PC, and tried to delete the software through the control panel.  It won't delete.  I am getting an error message.  I can't print either.

So now I am on hold with Belkin customer assistance.  Maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is, I swear I hear a little Indian accent.  That doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to India, and even if it is, that doesn't mean customer support is bad.  But my experience with this is that while I can get a real live person on the phone, he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back.  When I tried to get my problem escalated, I overwhelmed him and he put me on hold.  I am still on hold.  I have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight. 

I called back from my cell phone, and someone who sounded so much like the first operator I spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician, and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. When I strongly protested, asked for his name, asked for a number I could call directly, he offered to transfer me immediately, and now, I have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone.

I am starting to sense a trend here. My husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document, has gone off to work to print it there. I am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo, waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call.  

I usually discount negative reviews, but this is really my experience with this product, and if you are considering purchasing it, I would encourage you to think that through a little further.

I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it. The drive has a controller board error.  I contacted Western Digital for a replacement, but they tell me that it is out of warranty.  Apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it.  If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital. With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties, I will never buy Western Digital again

If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3. Turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more, not even close. I do not have a hearing problem, but this phone had me thinking I did. The speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality.

I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.  

Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say,  I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord.  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for

I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.  

Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation.

The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose.

As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy.

I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.

Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'.  Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up.  Fresh batteries, no go.  Called customer "service".  Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press "power + NAV" simultaneously.  As suspected, bogus advice.  Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total.  Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway.  Still no-go.  Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond.  Am still owner of unreliable GPS.  Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps.  Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product.  Don't do it.  Really -- don't do it

I purchased my 500 in September, it's now January and it has never worked correctly at all. It would say that I am in Russia, then lock up (I live in NJ USA). The first time that I sent it it, my expense, Magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours; and it was not fixed. It still said that I was in Russia and would lock up. The second time that I sent it to them, they sent me a shipping label via email. They had it in their paws for about 2 weeks. It came back said that I was in Peru and then lock up. I have an old Lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal, it always locked on to my location (albeit a little slow), and it worked.

I've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month. First they said that they sent it to me via email, but they said that because I have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my Outlook is rejecting the label. But, I use web based email. Then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail. It's been two and a half weeks and I have not yet received that label. They told me that they sent it out 3 days before Christmas and that I didn't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to Christmas and New Year's. But it's now January. Who knows, maybe I'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008.

It's clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk. It was a mistake to buy it; don't you make the same mistake.

This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work

My daughter bought this for me so I could see my grand children who live in other states.  I have spent 6 days and almost $450 trying to get it to work. I even hired a computer repairman who charged me $184 and could not get it working.  If it was not a gift I would send it back to get my money back.  I called the help line, lots of times and usually got someone who didn't speak English very well. They would end up telling me it was a problem with the router.  Then I would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the D-Link.  No one wants to take responsibility for getting it working.  I even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong.  Tried them all in six days and I still don't have it working and has cost me alot of time and "money".  Good Luck if you buy it you will need it

I have to admit, the main reason I purchased (2) of these DVC-1100's was because of the stellar reviews posted here on Amazon.  I bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and I so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance.  Great idea, bad solution.  The main problem I had was that the camera lens is fixed, and does NOT focus.  I waited 1 hour on the line with D-LINK tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera.  Unfortunately, the ones I got did not focus at all, and the video quality was absolutely terrible (washed out color and bad contrast).  Please listen to me, save your money and do not buy the DVC-1100.  This device is cheaply made, and just not there yet..

A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations

FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.

I ordered this product and put it in my Nikon D200.  The product was improperly manufactured, and caused the pins in my camera to bend, rendering it inoperable.  I had no idea what the cause was, and went to my camera store, and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well.

We took a quick look at the card, and the holes were obviously improperly aligned.  The damage to the cameras was repairable, and the replacement card I received worked ok, but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment

The one I ordered works, but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit I received has a slightly-flawed location. The nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle (outlet). My nub is slightly too high, preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet -- because of this nub, it'll only work in the bottom outlet. I see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place..

I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.

Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes.

I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response.

I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them. I think they will be OK, now, but I would not have purchased them if I knew they were so poorly manufactured. And, I do not have any good thoughts about Allsop's customer service

PNY memory is not very specific on its products, check and re-check that the specs. are what you need. PNY is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin (not that others are'nt, but...), pay the extra and go for respected brands like Viking and Kingston, you can't go wrong. In the long term, it's a better investment

Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not.

Do not order this item and expect to get what you see.  I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A).  Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing.  Buyer beware.  This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you

I paid $35 for a barely adequate product case. It does not securely mount or protect the Creative Zen. It is overpriced and underperforms. As others have mentioned, you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player. The set up feature is a joke -- you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band. taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product. The Design engineer should be fired.

DO NOT BUY -- THIS IS JUN

For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this

It is very hard to update the remote. Very seldom we can delete and if there are two DVR boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on, even though we choose the right one such as A or B.Software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a Intel Quad computer with 2 G memory. Can supply some patches. I have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless.

I love the Saitek 880 wired gamepad.  So I figured the wireless would be that much better.  Unfortunately, my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems.  There's nothing worse than the few times I really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out.  I bought this and the batteries died.  I sent Saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones.  Great, they worked!  Then they died soon after.  Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues.  However, this one's a dud

When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced

but the touch wheel is harder to use. 

I bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it. Since that point time I had a harder time turning it off/pausing, adjusting the volume, using the back and forth touch points, and setting a stop point in a audiobook. This is the result of the mini being recessed into the case.

I took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again. The case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for.

Also, make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since I nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip. 

I'll only use when absolutely necessary now.

I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.

On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time.

The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out

I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player.

There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it.

UPDATE:  The current model number on Sony's web site for the 50-pack CD-R spindle is 50CDQ80LS3 (not 50CDQ80LS2).  If you still want to buy Sony, try to find the current model number

you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else.  I find this strange though, because I've  bought (and still do) these same sony cd-r's from best buy, and at target, and at staples...and they've always worked fine.  I thought I would give it a go buying the online and I'm sorry I did.  If you want the sony cd's, just go to your local target and pick em up there...at least I can tell, based off my experience, they'll work.  Can't say the same for the ones coming from amazon

My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work.

The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it.

This review is more about the Hi-MD concept in general than one particular player.
The sound quality was excellent.  The rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace.

Complaints:
-The only thing that isn't proprietary is the headphone jack and the AA battery.  Beyond that, Sony's dual role as a content provider (complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players.  No Macintosh support is just the beginning.  Proprietary compression algorithms. Weird and twisted upload/download rules.  Wrong choices made at every point of the PRD process.


-100x recording speed?  Make that 4x on a good day.  100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of Elliot Spitzer, if he only cared.

-The players are flimsy.  Just walking with mine caused it to skip.  And one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely.  Sony will charge you to honor the warranty (parts only--no labor).  By contrast Apple replaced my daughter's iPod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups.

-Trying to find Hi-MDs offers the thrill of the hunt, if you're into that kind of thing.  But their rarity suggests that Sony is at best half-hearted about supporting this device.

I used to be a loyal Sony customer, but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill.  Sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing.  In fact, I'm planning an HD TV purchase next year and have Sony far down on the list of possibilities.  You can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days.

Howard, are you listening

I returned my Banshee stereo. It sure was loud, however the music seemed to wave in and out.  You cannot charge your iPOD either.  There is no remote.  There is no battery compartment - not portable at all.  There are many other choices for less price.  Save your money and look for something else

I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually.  But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not "custom" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars!  If the "custom" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears

There is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper.  The cartridges are not full!  I just got off the phone with HP tech support and they confirmed this.  The cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4X6 photos.  In fact, the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having "way less" than standard cartridges, "less than 50% full".  On a related note, I asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my  new printer were full, and he said they should have been full standard cartridges.

So this value pack isn't such a great value now, is it?

I will never buy a brand new product release from Linksys again. Their Q.C. stinks. I am on the third WRT54GX4 router and it is the first that was not defective. I got it set up and tried my new WPC54GX4 network card(SRX400) and got a weak signal, but I had my second laptop with a WPC54GX card(SRX200) on the desk getting 100% signal strength. I switched cards in the two computers, and the old SRX200 card was better in either computer(both XP Pro). After hours with semi-English speaking techs, they came to the same conclusion I came to in five minutes...a bad antenna in the new WPC54GX4. So once again Amazon will replace a defective Linksys product for me. I had been a Linksys fan in the past, but not any more. Here's a link to a picture of the first router I got and its defect.

I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.  

The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor.

I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player

I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.

First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap "watered down" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.

I bought a yellow "psyc" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.

I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them.

I was tempted by the low price of this item. The only reviewer before me gave it a 5-star rating. Although aware of the unreliability of a single review, I decided to gave it a shot, and paid $10 for shipping--no other way since it's sold through a third party. $28 later, I was holding the biggest $#!* I've seen in a while! The construction feels very cheap, and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old. And the worst of all, only one of the two microphones worked. Even the one that works is horrible--the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic. It uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics, and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?  I'll probably have to eat the $33, since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns. Well, I learned a lesson...things are cheap for a reason

Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is "fully charged" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back. 

Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option.

The Pros: 

-You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive.

-It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well.

-Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on)

The Cons:

-Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen. 

-If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen.
 
-It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied.

-After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it.

This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.  Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled

I received this item and it proved to be defective. I have returned the original item and Amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates. Right now I am looking for another source and about to cancel the order

I purchased one of these just shy of three years ago (Feb 2003). I have taken very good care of it (it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use) and used it several times a week while I teach. Over time, the silver finish wore off around the "on" button (apparently from perspiration from my hand), exposing the copper underneath. Last week, the button froze in the "on" position, so it is now effectively useless. The laser diode still works, however.

Also, the company offers "Geek Points" for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months. I checked the site earlier this week and, while it's now only been 35 months, the ones I earned from this purchase are no longer on record

I bought this item with good price. Good deal for the space 300GB. Moved all personal videos and data with confidence. After 6 months no power coming up. Unable to switch on. Went to data recovery center and told $700 to $3000 depend on the issue. Seagate want to replace the drive but helpless on the data. Be careful when you buy these "Seagate� 3.5-inch Pushbutton Backup External Hard Drives".

I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....  

2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player

I've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters. One of them was on an older Dell laptop,installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a Linksys WRT54G router with WAP encryption.
The problems really started showing when I tried to install the second and third adapters, both on desktop computers running Windows XP SP2. The software installation was a breeze, but when I plugged in the adapter - nothing happened. Connect to network...which network? Scan..who? What?
It looks like this adapter has a very, very short range and doesn't work very well a wall or two in between the routers. It would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one. But then it would find it again, and on and off.
Never really worked as expected on the desktops, so I've given up. I've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times. Downloaded the updated software from Belkin's site, and still have connection issues with the desktops. The laptop works fine as long as I don't take it one room away from the router.
Avoid at all costs please. I've used other wireless devices with the same router that I'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all.
Spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent. Spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing.
Good luck

The bag is very nice looking, nice material, everybody loves it.  Lots of compartments inside fit all accessories I need plus some documents.  But the top part (the zipper) is a BIG problem, it just has to get 200% in a way, while the notebook pocket doesn't provide any flexibility.  I just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out, very frustrating.  (same as another review here).  My opinion, find another one, I'm gonna do it myself

I ordered this cable a few weeks ago. Although I must say that it does work fine, the cable looks cheap (in fact, it is very thin) and its length is less than 6 feet. As you may agree, length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that. So for $20 (including shipping), I think it was not exactly a good deal

I bought an Airplay2 from am Apple store for around $60. Other than the fact that "blank" FM stations are hard to find in the New York Metropolitan area, and that you need to keep changing to different "blank" stations as you drive, the product itself is simply terrible. Even if you are in a parking lot, and find a "blank" FM station, the quality of the music the Airplay broadcasts is very bad. The bass is almost non-existent, and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of. This product is not worth buying, especially for $60

If you don't use the printer on a daily basis, these cartridges dry up only days after you stop. Given that the BJC-80 is a portable printer, I only use it while traveling, which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip. A real money drain

I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features.
Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable. 
With the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece.
Disappointed

Antec has dropped the ball on this one.  My power supply came in DOA.
If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.  

The case weighs 25 pounds.  It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.  

It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles

The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.

In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.

If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.

What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way.

When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house.

I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers.

Product wise a very disappointing experience. People wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good

First of all, I am a dyed-in-the-wool techie.  I design products like this in my job.  I know what every single one of those "what the heck is that?" settings in router set up screens are.  So I do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router "MORONS".  

Yes, I got it to work.  It will work right out of the box IF used with most pre-N wireless cards and, definitely, if they are Linksys pre-N cards.  That covers about 1% of those who would buy this router.  After three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default, I succeeded in getting it to "hand-shake" with b and g mode cards most of the time.  It would still randomly lose the IP requiring rebooting everything.  Not something my customer would accept nor would I sell.  

Some of the techie specs are a long way from what Linksys claims. Linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both.  They failed.  A non-techie spec important to everyone is range.  It has 20% the range of an old b mode Linksys router I had sitting right next to it.  Adding encryption dropped range in half again!  The wired router portion of it works out of the box, no adjustments required.  But you're buying this for the wireless function.  

Yes, I could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with.  But Linksys didn't used to be that way.  I used to buy only Linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware.  This is the third Linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or DOA.   Then why did I buy this one?  It was on sale and I wanted to give Linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good.  They've now lost it for good.  I exchanged the router for a Netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards.  Plus it was a lot less money.  

Has Cisco ruined Linksys?  Got me.  Did all the good engineers cash out?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for Wall Street?  You bet!  I'll stick with Netgear and Belkin from now on.

I ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to Amazon.  And I advised them why.  The THX 800 cable is not blue.  The THX 600 cable is blue.  I called Monster Cable and got hold of their technical support.  They said they have NEVER made a THX 800 cable in blue.  Amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue

The material and ergonomics of this phone is average.  The selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line.  Below are the factors that I considered before purchasing and my experience:

Range:  The range of the phone is very good.  I can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop.

Call Quality:  Average.  I have a Plantronics CS50 wireless headset that is on the 900 Mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit.  The call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear.  When I have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset, or vice-versa, callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call.  The Uniden is much more muffled and less clear.  It is however comparable to most cordless phone.  Not exceptional, but not bad.

Durability:  Average.  I have dropped my handsets on rare occasions, they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well.  One of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor, which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn't scratch the hardwood floor.

Special Note:  I suffered a power outage during a major windstorm.  The base unit will not boot up.  This appears to have happened to other reviewers.  This problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house.  On this issue, I have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars

Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster

I think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine, is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder, and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax!  I especially got this machine because I thought it was a quality machine, and wouldn't do that, but I was wrong.  Sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating.  I would stay away.  It prints nicely, but it doesn't help if it ruins your faxes.  I see other reviewers have the same problem

I have always bought and liked Uniden phones.  Tried this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation and because I wanted caller ID.  AWFUL reception - too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line.  Turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice.  Good range (which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call!).  Stay clear!!!!!!

This transmitter requires me to remove the case from my iPod 5G.  Even with the case removed the device doesn't fit snugly and works it way loose as I am driving.  The sound is fair even though the area where I live has many unused stations.  I would think it would sound much better than it does.  Poor quality product; has too many flaws to justify the high price.  I'm very disappointed and I'm returning it

it's a super idea, but i cannot say it works well. getting a free station is a real challenge, even in the underdeveloped Italy. and if you get one, but you are driving, within 5 minutes (or 5 miles) you lose the signal... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel.
is not good for cars, but works at home, connecting it to the radio. it needs to be improved

Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.  Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears.  Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wait no you don't.  All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution.  What a rip off.  Didn't even get a manual.  What kind of advertisement is this?  I know, the black market kind

I purchased this item on 6/3/06 from Amazon, and a 250GB ATA/IDE Hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor. It all went together fine and I could mount the volume easily enough.

The first thing I noticed is that it's wi-fi wouldn't work with WEP with my Powerbook. It'd work without encryption on the Airport Extreme, but not with WEP or with WPA. I noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days. I noted it wouldn't hold time at all consistently. It wouldn't register a network time server's data and was always in the wrong time zone, so I had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time, but it would still drift about ten minutes per day, and then jump an hour or two randomly, making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy.

I found it slow to mount, and it would sometimes unmount over working WEP wi-fi or hardwired Gigabit connections, which was disheartening. I then decided to call Tech Support, which is when things went from bad to worse...

Calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff. The tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around, which too up to another thirty minutes. Folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails. 

After *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released firmware update, it would work with WPA_PSK or open, but still no WEP. They couldn't fix the time drift issue. I repeatedly asked for a replacement, but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through, whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time, or another firmware update... they just wouldn't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until I was ready to scream. By this time, I was out of Amazon's return policy timeframe.

They refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts. I even sent a letter, telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or I'd post my experience here on Amazon. Of course, I got a replacement unit with no other reply.

Now I've got to get rid of the thing oneBay or whatever, take the loss and move on. I would never buy another D-Link product. I would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax.

I bought an Iomega NAS unit, which works very well, has multiple drives and RAID and, though it costs more, provides decent value and it WORKS.

D-Link has a lot to learn about customer service and should NOT release beta, untested products to the consumer market. Shame on them

It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru

I previously purchased a SIIG Firewire 800 Expresscard. After several weeks with SIIG tech support I'm told it is a known issue that card won't work with Dell laptops. So ... i phoned Belkin TechSupport before buying this card. They tell me they know of no such problems. Well, card gives exact same problem as SIIG! Works fine on Firewire 400 but the minute you use 1394b (Firewire 800) drivers, my Dell Inspiron 9400 bluescreens and reboots! Emailed and phoned Belkin tech support but no response/solution. From my experience, Dell Inspiron 9400/E1705's can't support Firewire 800.

Update: after almost 2 months of trying to get a resolution from Belkin, they advise their product development team is "still working on the problem". Would I recommend buying a Belkin product, no way, that level of customer service is a disgrace

I didn't purchase this one...it was a gift. I was hoping for a laser printer like one of the Brother All-In-Ones.

I opted to install the Lite version of the software from hp.com. I would suggest that everyone do this. The Lite version only has the drivers, none of the HP bull software that is included usually.

The thing that bothered me the most was the Automatic Document Feeder. I would start a scan job and everything is going fine, and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang. I had over 500 pages of documents to scan, and this machine really let me down.

Amazing how Hewlett-Packard can't even write reliable drivers.

I gave the item 2 stars because I got it to print sometimes. No buy

Installation: express install is over 200MB, full install about 650MB!!!
It REQUIRES you to upgrade to Internet explorer 6 to continue installation (how it this related to printer installation, and what if I don't use internet explorer - I do not). Install takes forever, is memory hog, then tries to sign you up for some services. 
I used to like HP printers. I'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that I would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software.

Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon

This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one

After nearly two weeks, I'm still waiting for Kingston to ship out replacement ram. The ram was installed and after just one day, the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning.

After calling Kingston several times, they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet. It's been two weeks.

I would strongly consider a different brand next time. This company is not responsive.

I've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color  cartridges. Four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two  weeks. Running the head cleaner just wastes ink (a lot) without opening the  clogged jets. Then you have the choice of throwing away a $30 cartridge  you've hardly used or printing with gaps. I will not buy another HP  printer. I've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost

I bought this cable, but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference. Faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture. Replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem.

Don't buy a longer cable than you need, and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet

Despite careful aiming, this has exactly, and I mean exactly, the same signal strength as my cheapie $6 Airlink 7db omni, and is weaker than my homemade Pirouline cantenna. Probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap, but save your money if you're expecting 15db performance

I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.  Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur.  Turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing.  I took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed, same issue.

I'm not telling anyone not to buy this product.  Just be cautious.. and I hope you have better luck then I did

The 3M Privacy Filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen. Otherwise you can see the screen. You can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it. All the filter does is make the screen a little darker. Don't waste your money

As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.  

Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is "hinged" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy. 

The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with

I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness. 

Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department. 

If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet

Anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds. I know because I just did it. The cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire. You could even use household scissors to gnaw through.

Having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer. However, if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer, you might as well get something with a stronger cable

For a few days it had trouble finding the satellites, then just went dead. It was never abused, never left the car. Out of warranty for just 45 days, $600 wasted. It is junk! Stay away from it

My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations.  In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches.  I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower.  I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen.

The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days.  At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop).  I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again.

I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW.

Besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned, Belkin support is horrible. The automated system consistenly disconnects the call, requiring going through their operator. My 4-port KVM stopped functioning after six months. There's no information on the web to help either. It's as if there IS no way to fix a KVM that doesn't work. Flash upgrading is a joke. I followed the procedure directly from Belkin's website. So I had to RMA replace it. Trust me, Belkin doesn't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall. Go with IOGEAR - they include all the cables with the KVM switch for the price of Belkin's without cables

The best thing about the Magellean 3000T is the large screen.  
Sometimes this gadget works like a charm--other times it just seems to pay no attention.  Actually, the touch screen function decides not to work.  You can sit there and touch, rub, hammer; to no avail.  I got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to Amazon.  First, I called Magellan's help line (the phone number was hard to find); apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon.  If you hear a click, it's okay.  Finally it works most of the time.  Damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration.

I agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download. In this day and age, there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers. A voice recorder is tool for on the go. So we should have to carry a CD with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine? This is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company

It's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you. This one doesn't save that much space. It works fine, but it's not comfortable to use

Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch

This is my fourth Epson printer and probably my last.  The Epson RX580 needs several ink cartridges.  If ANY of them is out of ink, you can't print at all.  If you're out of yellow ink, you still cannot print a purely black/white document!!  The system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out.  

I really resent that Epson is taking advantage of customers like that

I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK

I bought the Archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family. The device didn't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation.
My opinion quickly changed when I ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it. While I was able to download and synchronize (via Windows Media Player) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn't recognized as a USB device anymore and also froze the "external hardware" management function on my PC.  Right now I cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive, and so far customer service at Archos has not been able to help me, blaming the problem on driver issues on my PC (seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops), a  really frustrating experience. Seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced, so this may not be as isolated as I thought.

So I really like this case besides the velcro.  Basically I have it with me all the time and use it frequently.  The only thing is that each time I take my hp ipaq 4155 out, the velcro makes the loudest noise I have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case.  I wouldn't recommend this one... I am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips

I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment.  I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM).  In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision.  On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector.  This is with Vista x64.  I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund.  Rumor has it MS is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard.

Oh, and there's a bug with the IntelliType software that renders the pause/play button for media useless in Vista...

Guess it's time to look for something else :

I bought this premium priced product because it has both built-in voice-mail and speakerphone. The latter was the key feature I sought. Well, it works intermittently, just enough so you can tell (occasionally) that it's "on" but infrequently enough that you can't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation. It reminds me of the "Can you hear me now" commercials. 

I'd rather live with Courtney than own this piece of junk one more day!

All the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well.

Ugh. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!

We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft. At first it worked like a charm, but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason. We take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working. Then last week I added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke. Useless!!!

Beware of KINGSTON rebates!

Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.

I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).

The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1 � business cards when flattened.  No problem.

About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."

Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.

After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.

If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.

For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.

Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.

Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.

I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams

My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one

Received the product, it was not fully functional.  The buttons worked but the mouse would not track.  I loaded the software, trouble-shot everything, even put up with maddeningly insane questions from Kensington tech support ("Did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in?")  However, Amazon.com was very quick and gracious in the return.  

Remarking on the design: seemed to fit well in my hand, though it was a bit bulky; usb cord was very long -- a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach; might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly.

I'm a bit disappointed, I was always a fan of Kensington products, starting with the 90s trackball.  I also have a cordless optical notebook mouse.  I've been seeking a replacement b/c it chews through batteries like none other.  So far I am 0-2 on satisfaction with Kensington mice

I have now been shipped two iSkins for my 60Gig, and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place. There are at least three flavors of 60 Gig iPods in the marketplace at present, and more coming, it appears, so be careful which one you order. The manufacturer's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin, even if you know the model number of your iPod. I also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake. Throw it away.

I have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps.  Unlike the reviewers before me I have a normal size hand.  Over the years I have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist.  My favorite mouse so far has been a Microsoft Wireless mouse similar to the 5000 design but with the fake leather on the palm, which is no longer available.  I saw this "ergonomic" Natural mouse advertised on Microsoft's website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available.

The mouse caused instant pain in my wrist.  I tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking I just had to get used to the mouse.  My wrist pain just got worse.  After a week the pain in my wrist was so bad I wasn't sure it would ever go away.  Not only did I have pain while using it but for days after stopping.  Although I have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb.

I returned the mouse and returned to my old mouse.

I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....
By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor

I took the TV out of the box, plugged it in and nothing.  After pushing the on/off switch repeatedly, it finally came on.  Picture and sound were terrific so I was very pleased.  Turned it off with the remote.  Of course, the TV wouldn't turn on again with either the remote or the switch.  Pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on.  I called Panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone.  So now my new TV is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after I received it.  Talk about frustrating!!

These actually left my screen dirtier than I started with. It left behind annoying streaks and film which I ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution. I suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy; it's cheaper and more effective

They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth. 

Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out.

The cord design of these is terrible.  You'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from  your right ear to your attachment point.  This is especially agravating for RIGHT HANDED individual (pshh hardly any of those).  Why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player (or whatever) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short.  I always use the extra extended cable, which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use.

The sound is good for the price (doesn't compare to my normal set of headphones), but sporadically I feel like they are hurting my ears (not in a physical sense).  I have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or (more than likely as I've never had this before with other headphones) improper sound design of the speakers.

Question is though... would I spend the $30 amazon asks for them?   Yes, as they are definately the best in that price range, but don't go to Best Buy or Circuit City to get them as the price will be too high.  I expected more from Sony

Pros: Uses less batteries than the Space Shuttle... (6 AAs)

Great idea gone to H*** quickly due to LACK OF PRODUCT SUPPORT! Apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful COMPLETE LINE of tapes. Red, blue,white pearl (paper?) - Yellow smiley faces. Green metalic. Black on clear - but no white on clear...

There appears to be little, if any, hope for those who might actually like to COLOR CODE products in any single medium - plastic, paper, polyester, metallic,etc. Just whatever come to the designer's head is what's released. Five types here. Two there. One over here... No rhyme nor reason.

Dymo has done themselves NO FAVORS HERE

Stylish, comfortable, good sound quality...and utterly useless at noise cancelation. Great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes, and you'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight. Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this. Sure, turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise, but as far as I can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume.

This little scanner is not worth the price. It's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use. There is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency, large gaps in between the frequency ranges it's programmed to receive, and very limited memory capabilities. The small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device, looking from any angle and the backlit LCD display is unreadable. 

Reception of this scanner is poor on all of it's (very limited) bands, though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna. The scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources. The squelch is practically useless on this thing, it's either on or off, it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full, as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it's set just above the static level on any empty frequency. The sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding, but at least there is a jack for an external speaker.

On the bright side, the chassis is well built and strong, the buttons have a decent feel, not to light nor too stiff. The knobs turn with ease, but will not change their settings due to road vibration, they stay put where you set them at. The fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall, but it's not enough to make up for it's lacking feature set and poor performance

I bought one of these about 3 days ago and it's already broken. I try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my PDA. Not only that, but it drains rather than charges the battery. This is an extremely overpriced piece of junk, you'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want

I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea.

HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEA

A friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time.

Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back. 

Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips.

Either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me. I needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal. Instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item.

I ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when I received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order. The increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from $9.35 to $14.93. All the cartrides arrived within a day of each other. I would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones.

Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks.  First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product

I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do!  But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware.  I know, I know:  do it in recovery mode!  Whatever that is!  (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!)

And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and "Good bye" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open).  I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use.  Maybe the Mac Nation is right.

And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan!

At first I loved the compact iAudio player, but after the first week, the earphone input (hole in the player), didn't hold the input jack securely, resulting in no sound.  I could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second, but could not get it to work continuously.  Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and box, or I would return it

The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks

Not only was this difficult to set up (even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from Belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases) but once I finally managed to get it to work (by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip) it had practically no range whatsoever; in fact, my MacBook Pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75% signal, and once the threshold of the room was crossed, the signal disappeared altogether. A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink "home networking" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly. Anyway, I hope that there are enough UPS trucks in America to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require.

Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the "user manual" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy

I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, "high quality" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase

I bought this Samsung model in September because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction.  It went black the day before the Super Bowl.  It is now NCAA playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced. The service technician has tried 3 times to repair, now having replaced every component.  I am finally on a replacement list with no ETA.  The Samsung Customer Service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned.  The repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push Samsung - with no success

I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this "upgrade" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers. 

To be fair Tom (tech support) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time. However, until then I have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever. If my wife was not already used to the unit I would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer. 

In summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don't expect good customer service if you need Magellan's help.

I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!

I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity

I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE!

I bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive I was using crashed and took my backup with it.  

The Maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes.  The initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too.  So far, so good.  The problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files! 

The scheduled backup doesn't work at all.  The light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup ANY new or updated files.  

The synch is useless too.  It's like the backup function.  It will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to.  It's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it. 

To get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files I have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as I have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new.

I would NOT buy this product again.  It's not an automatic backup drive, it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable AT ALL.   

If you need a backup drive look elsewhere. Sorry to say, this one is a complete waste of money.

I just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in Vista Ultimate. It claims to have a QAM tuner, but I'll be damned if it can find any digital/HD channels on my cable. My QAM TV gets many. Very disappointed, documentation is at best lacking. Look elsewhere.

Functions absolutely flawlessly under Vista 64bit (unlike most other cards such as my older WinTV PVR-150).  If not for the next paragraph, I'd give it five stars for just this.  Heck, it does better under Vista x64 than my old card did under WinXP 32.  (Disclaimer: I tested the analog video only, not the digital.) 

But I discovered that it was running extrememly HOT, even when just sitting their idle.  So hot that you literally can't even touch it.  Ouch!  I ended up removing it from the case as I didn't trust it. Perhaps it's a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it's not in use.  Emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it shouldn't be warm at all

Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean.

I loved these earbuds for 5 weeks, right up until they stopped working.  The wires to the iPod (the stationary wires, not the ones that wind up) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing.  For a while it worked if I taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case.  But quickly stopped working altogether.
Too bad, they're comfortable, the sound is fine (great on the bus), and the retraction works good.

I bought this router hoping that some of the quality in Cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child Linksys.  Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.

That being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.


Pros:

This router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.
The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.
Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective "black hole" on my IP for most uninvited packets.

Cons:

Not all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.
Turning on the poorly documented "firewall" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds "port closed" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds "port closed" to some and "port open" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with "firewall" inactive).  I'm not sure how the "firewall" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.
The router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.
Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.

For what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.  I probably will not buy another Linksys, but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return.

BEFVP41 and Microsoft PPtP Servers

As you may have read elsewhere, this router has a problem with the GRE protocol used by Microsoft for their PPtP server (see Alan Bryant's May 27, 2004 review).

This will stop you using it with the built-in PPtP VPN client/server which is provided with Windows 2000/XP.

Here is the text of a complaint I have submitted to Linksys...


"I am attempting to operate a Microsoft PPtP server behind a BEFVP41 (firmware 1.41.1). I have PPtP Pass Through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed IP address of the server but the router refuses to pass the GRE protocol used by Microsoft (Protocol 47).

In answer ID 737, you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with GRE. It does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. GRE does not use TCP/UDP port 47, it is 'Protocol 47', something entirely different.

It seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem.

I and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the BEFVP41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the GRE protocol correctly.

Can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? This is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product.

I also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in IP protocols than myself."


I await a reply from Linksys as I write this review.


Having said all that, if you have no interest in running the Microsoft PPtP server, the BEFVP41 may do everything else you require. 

It functions okay as a basic NAT router and it's stealth capabilities are good (Steve Gibson's 'Shields Up' reports 'True Stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host).

The in-built IPSec tunneling works well. I am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of BEFSX41's very reliably.

The web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually.


To summarise:

A reasonable basic NAT router.

Very good stealth.

IPSec tunneling works okay (at least to other Linksys products).

Microsoft's PPtP server will NOT work with the current firmware version.

I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care. 

At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off. 

I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last

The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the "Catalyst" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy.  To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working).  The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited.  This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25.  I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things.  On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image

I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.

The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.  I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case

Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going.  I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse).  I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive.  I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up.  I went and found my niece..."Uncle XXXX, why does the screen look all funny"  The units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange.  I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem.  We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers..."dude, these %&#!".

Forget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks.  (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC).  The Rino 530's simply don't work well.  A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic.  $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem.  Frankly, the GPS is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes.  You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later.  The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked.

I spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected.  Every seven minutes?  Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that.  Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, "Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can.  If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises."  He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the LCD and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution.  Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases.  I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair.  

I've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most.  This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache.

I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use.  But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two.  In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the "3:00" position on the dial.  And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation.  It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time!  Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless.  I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead.  Even if it costs more.  Why spend money on something that doesn't work

Buyer beware! Item was shipped with a short in the electronics and had to return. Even though item clearly states that "this is not returnable", I returned it anyway, only to receive more problems. Stay away from this. I am refuting the credit card charges and plan on winning this one

I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.

It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea. 

For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.

I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit.

I bought this because I wanted a cheap no-frills phone with answering system, but it's performed very poorly compared with the one I had previously.  Specifically, it's very hard to hear anything on this phone, even with the volume set to maximum.  Definitely not worth buying

I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.

I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.  

If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere

I purchased this item per other recommendations and that of Stereophile magazine, thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting iTunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home.

First, reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the Transmitter.
Second, I tried the tweak (turning up the volume pot)suggested in other ratings.  This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer. 
Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.  

In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to "fix" it yourself-- don't buy this product

These batteries didn't last at all. They worked OK in my remote control for my radio, but on everything else, the quality was either below-average or just horrid. My digital camera didn't even turn on with these. Only recommended with low powered devices; actually I'd recommend a Rayovac or an Energizer rather than these. I know they're only heavy duty batteries, but the quality is still below-average

The overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic.  The sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion. The pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn't have a very good range (very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results).  not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit.  i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of, otherwise i would not have purchased the item

   For the first few weeks it worked fine, however, it started skipping and stopping DVDs after two months. I called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty, no case number was given at the time. The unit was shipped via UPS and received on 92nd days from the purchase date, and they charged $50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired. I called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because I don't have case number issued within warranty period. In addition, please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well. Next place for my DVD player? Trashcan *sigh*
   Go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit.

Pros:
   Cheap
   Dual screen
   Comes with gaming pad
   Detachable screens which is very easy to use.

Cons:
   Sub LCD screen isn't sharp as main, I thought it was defective for the first time.
   All the games are outdate

but 20 dollars more and hideous. I have a platinum Intuos2 tablet (a high school graduation present from 2004), and when I broke the pen, I ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it's being slightly cheaper on Wacom's site. Here, the platinum is 20 dollars more (and in my opinion, much uglier). I recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen

This makes no sense. If the industry standard is 4x6, why did they, Kodak, cut the paper to 4x6.5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 -- yes, I see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads "actual paper size is 4x6.5"

I still don't understand why they did this.  

Now I have cut the pictures down to the correct size...what a waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!

Pro ---

* Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row. 
For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard.
To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row.

* The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate. 

Con ---

* The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below).

* Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap. 

The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat "while on your lap or on a non-flat surface".
This "lock" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8" along the top of the board from the left half into the right.
Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated "V" shape after any amount of light-handed typing. 
HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed.
 
* The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to "enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle.
A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right.
 
* The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys.

* It doesn't turn off.


Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch. 

The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch.

What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries. 

The automatic "sleep mode" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard.
Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes.

The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly.

Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords "bluetooth keyboard". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch.


For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries.
Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user. 
Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row.


How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me.
All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name. 
It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism.
But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name. 
If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400. 
My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq. 

The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality. 
Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.

Well I got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker. Then the rear right channel didn't work at all. After calling tigerdirect to see about a refund. The first customer service rep was Rude and unwilling to help. Said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown UPS box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts. After getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough.  The headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses. the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn't sound that good at all

I bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new HP dv2000 laptop, with internal bluetooth, I was excited about the Instant View feature and the lazer percision, however when I got the mouse connected it worked, but no instant viewer?  Turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the DONGLE pluged in... but... the reason I bought a "BLUETOOTH" mouse was in order to AVOID a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop.

On top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are AWKWERD to press, I have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them, nothing like my old microsoft mouses' cozy side button.

The middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three... which is set to activate the "Amazing" instant viewer, which is decent, but useless without the dongle.

As far as lazer percision, not too noticable, my Kingston RF lazer mouse seemed to preform better.

The only reason I gave it a 2/5 is the charger is nice, the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish, which feels nice and cool against the palm.

This makes a DECENT desktop mouse, if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice.  Not something I'd recomend for a laptop user.  For the price overall subpar

Despite the claim that both units take AA batteries, the unit we recieved takes 9V Batteries.  That is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the AA battery usage as advertised.  Will review performance when we've had a chance to use it.

I have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired. The customer services rep told me that it will be $110 for a repair which I can almost buy a new one if I pay the shipping on top of that $110. I have other eight (8) LCD monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality. I'll newver buy any Proview products ever. I will give zero star if there is one

I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers. 

It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates. 

2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick.

Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now.

I just bought a 25 pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner.  To bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them.  I dont' think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it doesn't seem to matter if I "lightscribe" them or not.

The burner works fine with all of the other media I've tried so I'd avoid these discs like the plague

I use to Love Maxtor. Still Have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers. Well, The darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone. I did have a lot of it backed up but still, what a pain. Now that Seagate owns them, spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive. OR get a couple of these and RAID them. but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping

I bought one of these when I bought my Macbook to keep it in pristine condition, just a few months ago.  I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.

They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.

Really stupid design.  It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover.  Given the choice again I would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money

A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI & 4 dead pixels.  The replacement TV had even more dead pixels & Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon & Visa all gave me a horrible time & no respect.  So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now & still fighting for a refund.  My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection & no worries

Hello,

I purchased the AVIC-D2, XM and the iPod kit from Amazon.  I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup.  After 3.5 hours they failed.  

I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed.  I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II  are not returnable.  It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies.  Had I realized that Amazon would sell me something that I can't return I would have purchased elsewhere.  At this point I will never purchase anything else from Amazon ever again

Horrible. The gears ingage before the tape is even loaded. You have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it's own. When the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done. You can just hear the damage being done. This model destroyed several of my daughters tapes. We really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes, preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly. Thinking maybe I got a defunct one I had Amazon send out another, it too functioned in the exact same manner. Nope mine wasn't bad, their all bad, this model is disfunctional. I've advised Amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly. I wish Amazon direct had good models to choose from, this one is not

I am very happy with my Meridian Color and the other mapsend products I have purchased, however, at first I couldnt get this product to work.

I had no problem getting this software to run with XP (even without the patch), however I couldnt view the basemap I had loaded onto my Magellan.  I tried to address this with the company.  It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails.  Customer service for this product is nonexistant.

I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer.  Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the basemap.  I did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do.

I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though.  Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn.  I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it.  The Magellan Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps.

Get you head out of your a__ Thales.  You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.  I recommend anyone with a question about softward or the GPS join the yahoo groups and post the question there.  Dont waste your time with customer support.

This unit is not compatible with the Sprint PPC 6700 as posted above! Make sure you call Pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility. I tried the PPC 6700 and my wife's phone (another sprint phone, not sure on the model number). Both have issue and Pioneer's customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue, only to blame me for not calling Pioneer first! 

This unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that I ran into

The clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell.  I bought two boxes; both boxes stank.  Maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind.

I was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming, and its response time did deliver. It is more precise in it's cursor control than any other mouse I've used.

However, it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me. I find it's side buttons are difficult to use. They're very small and their action is not to my liking.

Further, I was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using Mac OS X Tiger. The Steer Mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons. I've found nothing that supports those buttons on the Mac platform to date

I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.  

It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably. 

Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless.

I bought these head phones because I read all the reviews that gave it 4's and 5's, so I expected a lot out of them. The truth is you really shouldn't...they don't sound particularly awesome and I was rather disappointed that I actually spent close to $30.00 after shipping and stuff. The mid-highs and highs sound fine, but I had issues with bass and mid-low response, especially when I plugged it into my computer. Plus they are not super comfortable either; the hinges nip at your neck when you don't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses.

All in all, I wished i had spent my money on something else. But they do look pretty cool.

I installed this in my new Garmin Nuvi GPS prior to making a trip to Iowa City, Iowa.  Thought that it would provide some information useful about the City and the surrounding area.  Found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in Iowa.  This is advertised as a North American travel guide.  Did they move Iowa

The printer works great as a usb printer, a fax machine, and copier.
It may as well not even have a network port on it.
The networking driver will find the printer ,but then it goes back to searching for 
a printer, and this loop continues till you give up.
I can't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem.
I can tell you that a Dell 1600 works great as a network printer, network scanner, 
fax & copier. We have 3 of these and we tried this Hp 3055 and I would not reccommend it to anyon

Amazon recommends the $59 Apple Protection plan for the Ipod Shuffle --2nd Generation  ----  Be advised the Apple store offers a $39 2yr plan for just the Ipod Nano 2nd Gen and Ipod Shuffle 2nd Gen.  Both plans work great, If you have one of these two new machines save yourself $20

I bought 2 of these drives to set up a RAID1 array (mirror) and one of them continuously has errors, causing the array to be degraded. I called tech support and they said these drives do not support RAID. Big let down, I have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more

I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY

Don't believe the claim that you can "just plug it in and it's ready to use." This product is set up for Windows, and the instructions for installing the drive for a Mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the Windows software. It's easy to become hopelessly fouled up.

Don't expect any help from Western Digital. If you can actually get connected to them, and your call isn't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so, you'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive. Their web site help is equally useless

This kit is neat; I have to admit that.  It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book.  However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided.  The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself.  Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you.  You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want.  It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy "scrap book" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.
However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the materials included

Purchased for my daughter, an English teacher, Scrabble lover. She said she'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the Franklin she'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game. She said it would end up on a shelf in her house. She'd rather have a paperback Scrabble Dictionary. I returned the Franklin. She didn't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play Scrabble in class

I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed

Don't buy it.  In the 6 months I had the phone, the screen burnt out so I can see the numbers, the answering machine is horrible, and I get better reception from my baby monitor.  I had a cheap Panasonic beforehand which was much better.  This was a complete waste of $$.  Hooking it up to your PC to get those "cool" features is just a pain.  I'm having a tough time returning this.  Be careful

While I have been very pleased with the performance of this product, configuration and setup was very easy, and even updates to the device are easy to do, it's not reliable.

It seems that every 3 or 4 days I lose connection to the Internet. This is a 7 PC network, couple of servers.  There really isn't huge bandwidth being used.  But it is like it gets frozen - you can't ping it, you can't get to anything on the outside like the gateway or DNS servers, and a simple power reset gets it working again.

Nothing is in the log, I have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem.  I have checked all the ideas on Netgear's site without help. I know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night, when no one is using it.  Could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow? But it sure is not reliable, I can't recommend it

I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system

This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless. The carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself. The ONLY way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors. Even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iAudio into the tiny case, the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger. I returned mine immediately. If you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed, ill-fitting, unacceptable piece of worthless junk

I just wasted $16.35 on this piece of junk.  It arrived quickly, and became unusable even faster.

For those of you used to disposable screen covers, there is only one in this package!  The instructions say you can clean it, but it came out of the packaging with lint on it, which immediately adhered to the sticky side, and could not be cleaned off.  

Since the package was opened, it could not be returned.

This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket...

 This is my third Asus mother board. All were great, manual was excellent and email support was swift. Now all of these reasons to buy asus are missing. Manual provides no assistance, zero. FAQ online, nothing. email for assistance, no reply. Asus user Forum, no help. Got all accomplished without assistance. Went to register .... and couldn't get that done, so I gave up on it. I've wasted 38 hours on account of missing basic information & support. My previous motherboards (ASUS) were well documented with excellent definitions of BIOS options, etc. Everything went smoothly. I expected the same excellent support from ASUS today, I didn't get it. No more Asus. Be ware

With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you

First off the Software is Horrible!! I have XP Media Center and the Win2000 interface program won't even run. The hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer; Now my Cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray, an error message comes up saying I have no active mixer devices available. I spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up. 
The remote is useless, I will have to get a Microsoft remote, and the picture quality using Media Center is POOR at best. 
Save your money and AVOID this item. 
IF YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND INSTALLING NORTON GOBACK OR SIMILAR SOFTWARE TO UNDO THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

These are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.  

Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.  

The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more. 

The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.

In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long

Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that

I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.

After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it

I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.

The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand

The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER

I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.

the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company

If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. 

The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.

Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin. 

Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.

But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??

I purchased these about 3 months ago.  They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere.  I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home.  They are already ripping in the back.  
I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are.

I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again

I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy

The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist

I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all

I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles

Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month

This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.

Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for.

Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes

Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company. While we were happy with the quality, our order was missing 2 shirts. Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know, but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. If you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company

I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this

The product is great

These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes.  The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact.  I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.

They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them.  I returned them and plan to try something else

I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of
Jockey's

The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear

I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.  

I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund.  I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product

Quality was terrible, undersized or seconds. Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price.

I would not recommend these to anyone
I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product

...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called "Hollywood Heelz," I should have known better.
I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone

The material's good, but the suit runs way too small.  I ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements, but all my wobbly bits are poking out.  I don't think I could wear this out in public!  Not for curvy women!

I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were "sheepskin". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not "curly and fluffy" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me " they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless.
What happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund. Nice

I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!

Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will

These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..

These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!

The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit

I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it. This clock is a piece of trash.  I never could set it correctly. Each time  I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode. The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed.  Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set.
If you buy this clock you will regret it

The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16

They're pretty, but flimsy.  Very light construction.  The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it.  It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off.  Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face.

I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore

Bought one for my new ipod nano, a total disappointment. Very poorly made. Only glued together not stiched up,It already started to go apart. You won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small.  Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out.  It looks pretty but that is all

the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience

The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

I saw the reviews and ordered the bag, the first impression was it looked pretty good! I was happy, if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. I had to trim to remove the hanging threads. There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 

don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 

The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.

On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).

if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag

I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them.

Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes

The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap.  I bought
it for my wife to carry "all that stuff" to work.  With out the strap it does not work.  I requested another one, got it, no strap.  On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.

     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.
     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.
     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order

I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality

I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...

I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas.

I would not recommend these hats. You definately get what you pay for. The sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed (even for a 6.00 hat.) I basically threw it out. The sad thing is, I spent as much in shipping as I did on the product

The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.
Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.
Thanks.

Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side

There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it.  These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person.  Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric.  They're not made for warmth.  All around disappointing

I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken"

THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS

These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears. These splits, although tiny, allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles. I still wear them, but now only for fashion instead of function

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit.

This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed. 

It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either. 

I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me. 

For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target

Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product.

These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.

I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it

I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard

I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee

When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping

I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop

I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".

However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose

Save your money. Its worth a buck, if that. I cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage. Shipping is a complete rip off, and I will never order from this company again

Item was called "Fleese" but was 80% cotton and looked & felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&H. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai

These compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind I have.  Aside from the low grade material and poor stiching, the waist band rides up around my chest!  It looks like they were designed for someone 7 feet tall

I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company

I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.

I love the t-shirt because I loved the movie, but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms, this may present an issue for you.  The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit

I bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it.  The quality is poor.  The wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way.  Also, the wallet actually looked fake (not sure if it is) because the XOXO is upside down.  You cannot tell from looking at the picture.

This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.

These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.

The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great

I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals.  The Betula sandals are clearly inferior.  A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.

With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item

I liked the boots in the first couple of weeks-they are very warm and comfy, however they are not at all durable -after a month of use the soles had holes. My freind who had them experienced the same problem. 
They are great feet warmers when the weather is dry, but they are not waterproof.

I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did

Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls

This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.

There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.

The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.

There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)

The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.

I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars

Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service

Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  This shirt is large in size but very short!  Not what I had expected.  Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter.  I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem.

I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.

I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy. 
They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet.

I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players

For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable

I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!

Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away

These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply

For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people

The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.

These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.  
My advice: DONT GET THESE FOR A BIG, TAL MAN THEY'LL MMAKE U FEEL LIKE A GIANT

These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  

I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot

I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.  

I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick

I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16

I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.

It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information

The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product

Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.

For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic "torpedo" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable.

We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you

I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!

sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.  

1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe.
2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick.
3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.  

this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair

While they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they aren't even close to being "leather." I don't think I would have bought them if I saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand.  Not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller

I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking

:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.

accustomed to the zipper pull tab being on the right hand side.  all my other zippered garments come that way.  this turfer men's endurance shell jacket has the pull tab on the left side which makes using it feel majorly awkward.  would not buy again for that reason. 

this shell is otherwise nicely made

One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...  

One more thing, only the screen is protected by a clear plastic. The wheel is not

I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally.

I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.

I bought two of these, hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event, and quickly returned them.   Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term "charmeuse", and are thin and gauzy.   They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz, much of that must have been the packaging.  A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction

I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).

At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.

Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere

The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 

There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection.

The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again

This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each

I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment & they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one

I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite

I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.

Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good..

Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all

Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me

"Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading

Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed. 

Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product

I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price

I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.
By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing

"Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Big time

The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's "profile" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about "low-rise"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN� briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear

I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.

I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now

The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all

"Classic" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now "spinning"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not "classic!"

Even though I bought these for $9.99 I still somewhat regret it. The quality of the jacket is "really" poor. Every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed-- from the pockets to the zippers. While wearing it, the jacket smells like "paint" or what they used to bleach the colors on. I hope the smell gets out after washing. I am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when I wash it and onto my other clothes

I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets.
You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.

IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE.

I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.

This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund

I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However,
when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been 
$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.
Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.

It's true that you get what you pay for. The good thing I can say about 
this product is that the price is right. But the quality was low and the fit
was poor. HOwever, if you are strapped for money then they are certainly
wearable. But get a half size smaller than you usually would get

This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all.

The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase

Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain.
The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain.

I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.

Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product

I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles

In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.  

Good luck, shoe shoppers

WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight!  You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...

You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.

I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available.  As far as appearance, it is well crafted.  When it comes to functinality, it stinks.  Here are the problems I have with it:  1) there is no hole for the microphone,  2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.  This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.  This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player

I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort

I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry

I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this.

Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way

This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.

I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful

While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.

All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product

They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me

Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again

Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.

Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.

Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. 

Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.

I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice

Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price.

These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again

My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on

In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose

Good features include many pockets.

Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.

Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets.

I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product

I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.

This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."  Ahem.

In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): "quality is a subjective issue."  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.

Wish I could rate as a "zero

Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.

I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice "just because" gift. When I opened the package I was really disappointed. The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together. 
Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad. The problem with returning is the non-refundable $7.50 to ship to me and the $5.95 I have to pay to ship it back to them. 

I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn't find my order.

Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..

I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.
The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic

We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive

This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam

The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)

The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!

I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company

The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended.

The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.
They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.
I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them

Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.

Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...

I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 
It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.

After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.

Hey! I'm twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these. They feel really nice on the skin and they don't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do. They also give really good support to your penis. They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort. Boys, ya'll all seriously need to try these undies out. They're awesome

i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.
i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg.  there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric, but there is more like 3 inches...yuk!  ; b
has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured?  (the ones that we all seem to love and want)?
please email me personally if u have found them!

Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again

My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return

The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.

This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund

Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing

I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe

These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product

I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily). 

I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.

I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now

Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

Not happy

Have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems. This time was different. They sent the wrong shorts. I paid the shipping to send them back. I asked, please send the right shorts. They credited my account an amount smaller than I paid. And that was that. Certainly not satisfied.

I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item

I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size. 

When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing. 

That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair

The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm

thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.

i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it

   This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed, I will not do it again. The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it.
   I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and I was ignored. Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late. I thought that the time limit was 180 days.
   I like everything else about the jacket, but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration, there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there

Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps

I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO

I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..

TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.

This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...

Thanks, hope this helped...

I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.

Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.

They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.

DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.

You've got to be con artist to sell these things

The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all

These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.

I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely

Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.

At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.
But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.

Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me

The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time

I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic

I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern

These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!

After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.

I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.

I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere

I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.

Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.

Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time

I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION.

SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????

I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.

I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.
Not that there is anything wrong with that. ( Loved that Seinfeld episode

The slipper seems to have some craftmenship. In my case they seem to run about a half size small. Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch? I wish I had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though

I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman's guide.com. When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking. The black pair was dull and had no shine. Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes.
All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned
my lesson

Save your money and lock your luggage with cheap lock ties.  Our TSA lock was cut the very first time we used it.  Turns out the ENTIRE terminal has only 1 set of key so screener just don't bother /have the time to unlock this approved lock.

I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them.  I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs.  Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful.  They were returned...  If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size

I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in

Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one

I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway.

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn

The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb "was"?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash.

I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.

The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear.

I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products.

This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.

I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks "repaired" so they never really wear out.

**Black version has large "Betula" on side in white

Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.

I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them

I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper

I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.

I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable
and because they looked like they were made of leather.
They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not
attractive.  They will be returned.

First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear

I guess you get what you pay for. the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item. It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat's litter box than a magical device

In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back

I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition

Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.
Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning

The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
     1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)

I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope.  I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store.  I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf.  It was a wasted of money

The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.

Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.

A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.

I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph

These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.

Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them

I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.

Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned

These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.

With a longer inseam, these would be awesome

I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.  I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand agai

Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand

I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.  Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours

At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.

I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.

I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices

saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, A&F, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.

As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating

Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22

I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT

These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.

I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat

I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them.
After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back. 
Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!!
Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them.

I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!

Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product

The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips.  I am a 5'6" 120 lb. small boned female.  The company offered to exchange it, however did not offer any others with cell phone holder.  Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item.  I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now

This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.
After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review

I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!

Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.

I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this

I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.

Really uncomfortable. I wore them twice and then threw them out. They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little. And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment. Not worth the $5 I paid

This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each?

I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr

These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.

The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that

These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again

  These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.  
  They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes

Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking & the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far.

These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots

To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.

I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all

I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me.

I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire

This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase.

They are warm and comfortable while they last.


All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.


It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months

These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable.

Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help

I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas.  I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach.  I am really disappointed with the size.  It's pretty deep, but not very wide at all.  No way I'll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag.  Still, I'll be able to use it for other things

THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM

I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time.

I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again.

Even though I favor leather, every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate. Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling. The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots, I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas

I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot

I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.   It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk

Beware, the size is not true size fit
My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands.
this is not a small, it's loose fitting and it's a straight line cut. it's really BAD.it's so disappointing.
everything doesnt holds in places, it doesnt look like the photo at all.
the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid.
Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy, and if you are a medium, you need a SMALL for this dress, and it will still fit loosly on you. that's how big of a dress this is.
I'm returning it

size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled

I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit.  I even complimented her on them.  I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon).  I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them.  Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving.  Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic.  I was disappointed.  If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..

These shoes are not as cute as they appear, the heel is really 2.5", the material is cheap, the fit is too wide, the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in, etc. etc. etc.

On a positive note, it's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress. 

Be warned, the company claims that all their shoes have 2" heels when they don't and they charge tax on shipping charges..

The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  

The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered

the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc

Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my 
circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also, 
the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and 
your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.  

If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.  
It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear
under their helmets

I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale.  But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be.  In addition, the fabric is bad.  There are tores in all of the edges

This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.

A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses

I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting.  By the end of my fitting, my feet were throbbing, red, and pinched.  Literally, my pinky toe was purple.  

I bought my true size, but I still don't think these shoes would've been wearable even with a size larger.  They must just be REALLY narrow

The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00

I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone

Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame....

The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift

These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them

These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice.

IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR.
MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT

Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product.  I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging

I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies!

On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future

The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands

We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product

I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long

You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. "You get what you pay for" applies to this product

I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price

These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks. They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe. Not only does the seam press into the toe, but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself. Terrible product

I was very disappointed with this bra.  I would definately not recommend it.  If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead.

This bra looks sexy, but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra (at least not for a size 38DD)

Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not!

I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY

When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped. 

The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.

The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.

Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.

When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.

My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks.  I haven't seen them online, but this is worth a trip to the store

I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the "delicate" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's

This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up

For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue.  Very dark.  Also, the sizes run big.  Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned

Although very cute, Crocs are not good shoes.  They are a cheap, plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all.  I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are "non slip".  She did slip in them, many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet.  They are the right size but I just think they are not made well.

Don't go for the hype. They are a useless shoe.

My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket.

I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.

I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and "break them in" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years

So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again

I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.
I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again

I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH

On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days.

OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow

These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though

Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit.

Not comfortable.  The "thong" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable

I wish I could give them -5 stars.
I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $170 should be really good. I couldn't be more wrong. The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day!!! Stay away at all cost

The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  

Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety

I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991

I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2

I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe

this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought, my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it's SUPER tight on her.... this was very disappointing to say the least.... if you normally wear a small in other things, I would suggest you buy the extra large in this. The quality of the material is GREAT that's what made me even give this product a 2..

Ok.

<review_text>
I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  

I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging

OUT OF STYLE!

All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans. They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style.

The fit, quality, durability, and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago. There is definitely a noticeable difference, and not a positive one.

The price far exceeds the value - OVERPRICED!

These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.

This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap.  When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off.  When I emailed Alys's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this bra

I was so disappointed in these. I am full-busted (38DD) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time.  I used a band-aid and it did a better job.  These provided no help at all. AND they REALLY HURT taking them off

These didn't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much. They do have great adhesive. Also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola, because they are pretty small. I used every pair, just thinking I was putting them on poorly, but everytime, I was a pokin

I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again

I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again.

I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.  

If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!

the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.

I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock

I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.  I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle

I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut

The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors.

These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11" by 8.5" by 6.5", the one I've got is surely not that big (10"x8"x4" at best!), and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it (and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise, was it what they were aiming for?). The material is ok, so is the craftsmanship, but the fact that they  lied (yes! l-i-e-d!) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal. A great dissapointment!!! :

I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?

The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a "T" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody

I love Vanity Fair. Their bras just fit me perfectly. When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair. Not only that, but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material. I tried it on in hopes it may fit. It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on. Not because of size. It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, "Made in Hong Kong.

The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order.  Amazon had said they would rectify the error, although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle, and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties, and a different strap entirely

First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product

I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.

I got two problems with this here lingeree:
1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label "Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear."
2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..

My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit

I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!! The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places. I mean, the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies! I even bought them a size larger, because some brands tend to fit a little snug

As far as the actual cologne, it is nice but order it from that company and you'll not get to smell it because you wont get it. All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller

I bought this item because it said "optional belt clip."  The belt clip is only "optional" if you "opt" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot "opt" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip "optional."  I would call it "will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it," which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in

These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.

I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..

I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head

I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. 

All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort

These slippers are anything but comfortable. Besides the sizing being to small, I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid's slipper. The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone's foot, and the inside material is also anything but comfortable.

It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT

There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.

This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it

This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite

the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it

I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).

I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P.O. Box but the seller used UPS which won't send packages to P.O. Boxes so I gave an alternate address. I've never recieved the scrubs for my friend. I've sent e-mails inquiring about my order and haven't recieved any word back. I've been cheated out of my money.

These "cover ups" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun.  The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps.  They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for.  I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item.

i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIP�S.
its very easy to put a picture of the product!!

Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust. This made me look awkward and did not fit well. Don't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did.

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit

First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description

I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.

If your loved one is a beautiful 5'7", 130 lb slender lady like mine, forget about this piece of clothing. If, however, she is a 5'1" 180 lb gorgeous "petite" girl, this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for. You'll have lots of fun, first trying to put it on her, then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places, and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself.

Fun that will come after that is purely optional..

The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals.  I have had these sandals before and this didn't happen.  Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower, and thus more fragile, nubs.  All I know is, they are junk

I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again

The scarf itched my neck, smelled funny and was not the color of ivory. It was beige. It is not cashmere. It would not itch if it were cashmere

Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice.

Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again.

On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly

Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting.

I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.

The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric.

The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement.

I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of "wool-blend".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these

In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make

I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all

I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house

Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra

Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine

My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service

I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them.

I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as 
on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back.

The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all.

I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me. Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.There was no way to repair them. These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these. Really cheap. I am very unhappy. =(

Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable

I bought these socks to wear for work.  They didn't even last one day.  By the end of the first day, there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal.  By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels.  I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.

The next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.

I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(

A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother

I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra

I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..

In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware

This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....

Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back.

On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's

These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.
How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  :

This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping

I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off.

I recommend buying another model..

Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.

This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS

It hurted so bad... so I tried to "snip" it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming... it totally sucks.. now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience

I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.

My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory. 

Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.

 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past

I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.

I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again

Do not waist your money on this item! It looks so unnatural. The padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks, doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding. I was so disapointed when I tried it on.

I will be returning this item to the vendor.  I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery.  Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image.  Not sure what BASKE stands for.  I guess it's their idea of 'short for Basketball'.  WHATEVER!  You can't see the pic clearly.  I'm out the shipping cost on this one.  What a bummer!

Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...

While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy. When it came in the mail today, it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [which I really like!]. I was anxious to see what it was like.

This jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for FedEx envelopes. Sounds cool, huh? The jacket is extremely thin, and feels like you're wearing a paper bag. While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian, they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks

Very disappointing.  This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose.  The "high waist" was always rolling down.  I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.

I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe

Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more durable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they ripped in the back.  The immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look!

We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field(mainly insulation instalation) which requires him to climb in high places, walk on trusses, and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions. In my opinion these boots DO NOT have "heavy duty" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying "Made in China" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them. If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they're perfect

We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.  They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $26.23.  They insisted that it was not defective.  I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !

I bought this item, and was very disappointed when I received it and tried it on. The mock crocodile leather looks very cheap...the "leather" of the shoe is very hard and I could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. After which I threw the shoe in the trash....it was such a waste of money...do not think of buying it..

The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design. But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier.

I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend's daughters as a Christmas gift. The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly, as usual, it was nice packed and fast shipping. The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why:

- It was almost one week later than Amazon's shipment.
- It was an open, unpacked or returned item.
- Amazon charges the shipping for that item, even you qualify for the free shipping on your order.

If you don't care about all of these, please go ahead and good luck. I gave 2 stars is because of the product self, otherwise I would give none

It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says "size S fits 26-36")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.

Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares

This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves

This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.  I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this.  For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example)

I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them. 
I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.
In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. 
It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. 
The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. 

This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. 

I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price. 

Some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product.

I loved the concept of this item, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support.  The pants, however, were comfortable and I really loved them.  

The top needs to be reworked

I ordered this dress and when I received it, I thought that it was very pretty.  When I put the dress on, it was completely see through.  You could see my bandaid on my thigh.  I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material.
It's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable.
It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress (including pasties) because it seemed to show everything

I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing. 
 The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well. 
 plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.

a)the quality is not that great. 
b)the socks are not skid proof. 
BUT
its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too. sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk, at restaraunts, friends' homes, and sometimes the dryer eats them.:

The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all, but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn't cover my ears all the way. As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine. So I guess if you have a big head don't get it becuase it will not cover your ears.

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I bought this dress in black.  Good news--- it does flatter your postpartum shape.  Bad news--- the pockets for the nursing pads don't go where they should, causing leakage.  Worse, the color black showed milk stains after I leaked.  Definitely not worth the price.  How important is your figure when you're sleeping anyway

A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe. 

By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it

I totally didn't have a problem with the seller or anything, great shipping! Um, but, the book kinda rots. If you know how to tie a tie already, then it might be fine, but I don't. The pictures didn't really help, and the wording wasn't concise. One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways!! I practically destroyed one tie, definitely practice with a tie you don't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned, cuz they get pretty rumpled.

I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I 
spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well.
I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice
but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would 
expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole.

I almost fell for it...then I realized, how in the world are those pearls so cheap??  They aren't real!  If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it.  It would be helpful if the item was advertised as "imitation pearl thong."

If your name were Johnny Damon, maybe.  But you're bagging groceries at the Star Market for $7.25/hour.  Is this jersey really worth a day's pay to you?  The chicks aren't gonna be fooled into thinking you're on the team.  The Sox won't vote you a World Series share.  Your mom's gonna throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it, and you're gonna wish you had that money back when your buddy Tommy is selling his old Malibu.

I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper, which is why I bought it.  I see now that the description has been corrected, but too late for me.

also, the sizing does not run true as the current description states.  I usually wear 9.5, but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes

I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic

You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very "hard" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.

Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.

I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive

I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend "Jogbra" or "Chamion" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted.

I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced.

I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again

I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman. It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake. Stick with the strapless bras ladies!

We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement

This corset is not well made at all.  It's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear.  (I wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top.

I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day.  We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new!  These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on.  I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again, unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before

I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!
Follow-up: I see some people find my review not helpful, you know what: I tried to warn you. Obviously You either have too much money or You're stockholders of RainX. My advice for You: buy garbage, support economy

I bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock didn't secure the blade to the arm well. I had to buy a replacement immediately

I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money

I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one

I bought this product on a whim.  I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale.  Curious, I gave it a try.

First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water.  After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  It feels like spray painting.

Then you wait for the water to evaporate.  Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.

Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit.  It's as though it left a residue.  I'm not sure what it is.

But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..

Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money

I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"

Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound

I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device

This product was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father, unfortunately it did not perform for him. I was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model.
I am not sure if we just got a defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i have to say returning to amazon was straightforward they just simply refunded my money, I will inturn buy my dad something else from amazon you just cant beat the service

Fatally flawed.  Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped.  Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it.  An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel.  AARRGH!

Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now & damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid
everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.  

Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it & today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way. 

Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand.

I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:

- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve
- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.
- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel

If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!

AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway. 

I would NOT BUY AGAIN

It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.

The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.

I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.

Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it

As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous

I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.

Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.

If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.

Dimensions are confusing/inaccurate.  Stated height of 11.5 inches is not correct--perhaps this is shipping container.  Actual product is about 8.5 inches high, but taking into account the cradle for tire, only raises the vehicle about 6 inches

I got this item for my coffee-loving truck driver husband.  When we took it out of the box, we saw the obvious problem:  the "mug" is tiny!  Only a bit larger than an espresso cup.  To add insult to injury, it took way too long to brew for such a small cup.  Now it's back in the box collecting dust and we're sorry we wasted our hard-earned money

This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner.  The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.  I realize it isn't made for all vehicles but I purchased mine only after speaking with Lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle.  Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund

I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.

I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.

Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items

i wouldn't recommend this product.  The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp.  Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over.  I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger

It's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it.  Then you can never use that window for anything else. It's a pain because it will NOT work on tinted windows.

Don't waste your money. That's the short version. No stars for this P.O.S. Want more? OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.
I thought I was smart going on ebay and buying two for the price of one. I would have been smarter spending the money on lottery tickets

I purchaced this product because its a great idea.  The problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. Also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. Also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.

Hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery. Similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway

I also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money

To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. So I'm left wondering what good this is

Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place

This is THE worst smelling "freshener" I have ever used. Its just a terrible smell. Like the other reviewer said, its very chemical in nature. I sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and.....WOW. I opened the windoes pretty quick, I could not imagine this in a hot car. I picked it up for 1.50 at a BigLots and I feel ripped off.

Dont buy it

If you've seen the movie "Cars" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the "Radiator Springs" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.

Sure - it says "New Car Scent", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but I would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  First of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a Hummer.  It is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors.
 
I can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a Friday afternoon) I vacated the premises under duress, and by Monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  I've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people.
 
To be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  And why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  The claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, I couldn't recommend it.

I bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant. Unfortunately after about half an hour, the "memory foam" gets totally squished down and it's almost useless. Don't try to save money by getting this cheap one - spend the extra money and get one that doesn't suck.

I bought the "Wagan 9788 Ortho Cushion" and it does not meet the deminsions at all. The total lenght was to be 19". It's 16 1/2". ETC"

How can Wagan screw up something like that, or did they?  Making something to short by accident and lying to the people until it's fixed.

I only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when I sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever. It was a BIG disappointment

I was so excited about this bag but it was a huge disappointment.  The description clearly indicates WATERPROOF, but in fact it is mostly water RESISTANT, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation!
the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).
the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.
the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.
the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.
I cannot recommend this product

I purchased this for my 2001 VW golf, and it did not work. I know some of the other vehicles wire directly in, but you have to put a spare key in the unit and wrap it around the ignition. It made the install seem very half-a**ed. I could have just taped the key to the ignition at that point. I will get the immobilizer delete software instead of this junk. Thumbs down from me on at least VW and Audi application

March 14 FOLLOW UP REPORT: Pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. Teresa K. Naeole of Q. Industries by phone said I could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. Returned pump was received at 159 Islington on February 16 at 12:55 pm. I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul

I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.

The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.

I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution

Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work.  I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener.  Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position

My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?

We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.

I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable

Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find. 
I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once

I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting

We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound. 

Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.

 Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job.

I was unsure about this company so I only popped for a week subscription, felt the gamble of $10 was worth it.  Well not all gambles work out, this one did not.  When you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you have, now one might think once you do this that the information you want to access will be about your particular vehicle, not so.  I want to know how to replace a certain part, well you go to that part look it up, it tells you the replacement procedure for a car not even yours, and nothing about your car, uh!! C'mon. 

There's very little trobleshooting, no flow charts for troubleshooting.
Save you money and buy a Haynes Manual for your vehicle, you'll be much farther ahead.

This car seat cushion's foam padding is not only paper thin, but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts (I'm not kidding) placed in some of the cushion's "massaging bubbles".  This makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat, as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine!  I threw my "Massage Cushion" into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing

We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money

One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all

This includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item--who's actually going to put this on their car? It makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away. Check the picture--see anything messy you have to stick onto your car? Misleading and a waste of money. Don't buy it

A tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. That is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. My Accugage was reading 5 PSI high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. That's why I give it only one star

I had this alarm professionally installed by PepBoys (which is DesignTech's recommended professional installer). After the initial installation with all the wiring was done, PepBoys found out that the brain was defective. They confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. After being on the phone with DesignTech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and I just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided. After my 2nd visit with PepBoys, it was the same problem. And yes, DesignTech sent me a defective replacement. Several more calls and faxes later, I got the 3rd one, and that one turned out ok.

The features worked fine, and the batteries lasted me a long time. But the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic (even the silver one). Other than that, it worked fine. I got a new truck, and this time I've invested in an AudioVox system (sold under the Pursuit brand) and I love that everything is so integrated and easier to upgrade. I still had a professional install it and I've never had any problems with it.

The Design Tech Deluxe Remote Car Starter comes with excellent features and a compact remote.  The problem is, the item I received did not work.

All wires were hooked up appropriately and double check with a test kit.  Once hooked up, there was no response from the unit.  After hours of attempting to troubleshoot, I looked online at Design Tech's website for local authorized installers in the hopes that they might be able to answer my question.

Unfortunately the three "authorized" installers in my area REFUSED to touch Design Tech's equipment because, and I quote "they're too difficult to work with.  We haven't had much success."  

A little alarmed by this response, I attempted to contact the company using their 800 number during their live tech support hours.  After waiting 1/2 on hold with no approximate wait time and no end in sight, I hung up and decided instead to return the defective unit back

This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop

The product would not put out enough current to help with the drain on my battery. I think I purchaced too small of a unit for my needs.  May work well with a smaller type of battery, not on a car battery

I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter.  (On this car the cigar lighter is "live" even when the ignition is off).  The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day.  Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working).  I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite.  Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did.  The old intermitant (sp) connection problem.  Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it.  Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.  I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do.  99.999% of the users could not make this fix.  So just forget about it.  This thing is garbage

It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire.  It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  STAY CLEAR.

We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache

We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.

The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.  I'm not sure if its the product or whether Amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit

I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. Will this company stand by its product like that? I doubt it... For a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... It's a scam..

The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil. 

Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.

gimmick.
There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires.

Sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out.  Most "quickie-lube" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.  

The right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge

I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.   The outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, I guess it depends who defines a few minutes.   Both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water.  To make a pot, that would be 100 minutes.   I am returning as I am definitely disappointed

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT

This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.

This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.

This product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows.  TV convinces you there's a real chance you might find yourself underwater in your car, and now whoever manufactures this makes a killing.  I'll put it in a drawer with my SARS facemask, my whole life insurance policy, and that replacement plan Best Buy just tried to sell me on a twenty-dollar pair of headphones.  I'm sure this thing works as advertised, and I'm just as sure you'll never need to find out.

Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model.  However, it is also dim.  Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  Very disappointing.  After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit.  I did not purchase from Amazon.  Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down.  Turns out there is no warranty.  Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it

after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.

Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.  

It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website.

I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.

Save your money and try a different product

I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe

When the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light.  This was a fluorescent version.  The replacement unit- quickly sent by Amazon -was LED.  The same case and everything but with bright LEDs inside.  I liked it much better than the fluorescent one.    
The second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted.  Then the LEDs would start blinking.  Like an emergency light.  Sunforce said that this was not normal behavior.  I returned it as well.  The light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use.  A nice product but quallity needs to be improved

I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality

We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..

This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well

This product is absolutely worthless, especially in the hot Texas summer.  The pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit.  It is still blazing hot when you get inside.  Don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of garbage.  Better to leave your windows down or park under a tree

I suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com.

Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA:

You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.

But does it really do that? 

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?

Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. 

"I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day," Black said. "I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing."

After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV. 

The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. 

But does it really do that?

On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.

The only thing you need is a pair of scissors.

Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.

We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.

The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in.

Next comes the weather stripping.

So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.

While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.

One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.

We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside. 

But just to be fair, we test one more car.

We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees.

We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees. 

While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes. 

In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.

Will it work this time? 

Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.

Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. 

Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.

Don't waste your money on this one.

If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense

this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad.
Also they are hard to place with powered windows

This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??

This product does not cool down the car.  It is too small.  I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe

Installation of these blades is not straightforward--three adapter pieces and a pin are included, which might work well enough, but the instructions provided with the product could not be more of a joke. I'll be returning to the store and asking one of their employees (at Kragen) to install all three blades (they're nice enough there, if you're willing to wait). In the future, I won't be buying this product when I need new blades. I don't mind a bit of complication in installing stuff like this, but the instructions should be adequate to the task, and they're really not

I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.

We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.

In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)
WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz
Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS

We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!

This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal

We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us

This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that "after-market products" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description

We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.

I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one

I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW

The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!

WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. 

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys.

I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub

I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there

I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!

This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself

I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.

In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)
WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz
Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS

We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!

This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal

We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us

I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.

We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.

This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that "after-market products" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description

We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.

I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one

I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me.

What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing

I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW

The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!

WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. 

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys.

I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub

I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there

I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!

This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself

I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.

We ordered one, it didn't work well.  It seemed great, but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind.  based on all the reviews, we thought we must have had a defective one.  We ordered a replacement, but it seems to have the same issues.  Very disappointed.

I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it

My almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller (she's tall, but still gets tired sometimes, especially if I take her shopping). I researched the options and picked the Maclaren Volo. My first stroller before it was Chicco Capri, and it always bumped against my legs, which was annoying and uncomfortable. When the canopy broke, I got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings.
The Volo seemed great - light, handsome, convenient, and highly rated by parents.
I ordered the stroller and, upon unpacking it, was quite pleased with its appearance. I read the instructions and learned to use it. The stroller seemed sturdy, well-made, and easy to maneuver, not to mention chic.
The washable seat was a good idea, I thought. I liked how large it was (perfect for an older child), and how easily it moved.
When I took the new Volo around the block, I noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly (one was higher than the other and did not rotate, which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound). Then the other set stopped rotating when one(!) pine needle got stuck in it! I had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street. Needless to say, that's not the quality I expected, since every parent I know raved about Maclaren. 
The canopy kept sliding off the rails, as well - something you would NOT want at the airport, with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow.
When I got home, I looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them, but to no avail. They were flimsy (I could dent them with my finger if I wanted to!), way too small and just poorly designed. I immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to Amazon. 
I was very disappointed. One would think that for such a high price, the wheels would be usable - after all, they are the most important feature of any stroller.
I will stay with Chicco and order a C6. At least I know that the wheels are great, and you can't beat the price

I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat.

This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well.  I took it back to the store and they marked it as "defective".  For a few dollars more, I got the "Healthy Care Booster Seat" from Fisher Price.  I've had much better luck with it

We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk

I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.  Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover "material failure". I will not buy anything else from this company.  Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous

This product just doesn't have much variety.  My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times.  They are 5 months and 1 year.  She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids

  I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.

For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work.

I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it.
Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son.

I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room.  I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great.  It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit.  I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel.  This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price.  I bought it yesterday and took it back today.  I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use.

We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.

We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!

We had the Fisher Proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital.  This was the one we picked in our price range.  We had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it...until there was some weather changes.  Every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound!  Buy the sound a lights for $15 and save the extra money!!

After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably, I returned it. This is one of the few products I've had that truly made me ask, "What were they thinking?" The monitor gives off a loud "out of range" beep whenever it's not in good communication, and there's no way to shut it off. Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it's out of range even when it's just in the next room, and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep. But that's the least of it. The voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit, or not. This is annoying, but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room. And finally, the transmission is absolutely unintelligible: it's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound--speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor. In short, in no respect is this a functional product

This was the worst monitor we have ever had, and we have had several with our kids.  It says the range is 600 feet, but it doesn't even reach 200.  Our cordless phone reaches twice the distance.  The light makes it very annoying at night.  It beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently!

OKAY, FOR STARTERS, I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE. IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD. UNTIL...I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT (AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS.) WHERE TO BEGIN, THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS. WHICH MEAN, IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS! I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE. SECOND, I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION (24", THE ONLY ONE THERE IS) BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1/2 INCHES. THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION. IT DOESNT. I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION. IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK, I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE. UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS, THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT. NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE. DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH.

I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery.  After my delivery the bra was too small.  With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small.  I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery.  I thought they were big just before delivery.  

I decided to go w/ bravado bra.  It has worked out much better.  It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way.  The sizes are more flexable then medela.  The strap support is better then medela.

I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another.  No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding.  And breastfeeding is their main purpose

This bra is very comfortable once on.  Getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head.  It rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body.  As far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed, which with a baby is all you usually have to work with.  The star rating is only for comfort, 0 stars for function

I like the idea of all this in one case (and it's hard to complain at this price), but some of these things would be better bought separately. We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time.  #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice.  #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little!  #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work.  #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby.  #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.)  #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less.  #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.)
Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it. If you get it for a shower gift, great; if not, you can find substitute items just as easily

I have seen this product( and others similar to it) .  As an RN,we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the "cuteness" of items that are geared only to be sold, not to be useful.  Although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful,and some essential, it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately.  In this way, you can check for quality and longevity.  Put together your own kit.

This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care.  The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails.  The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip.  I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering!  The case is cumbersome and of poor design.  Everytime I open it - everything falls out!

I have small hands, so I actually can't grip this product with one hand. It slips right out, because there is no hole. The items are okay, really don't like the nail cutters though, and they don't stay in there places.

I'm sure there are better kits out there

The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.

This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges  also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out

I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods.  You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.  Don't waste your money on buying this

This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib

I like the music, but we have to have it on auto to play.  Because I have a mirror in the seat to see my son(he is still backward facing), I can't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on.  Also, I have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim.  So just music plays.  There are plenty of other smaller items that can do that.  This thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe.  I am changing them every couple of days, and we aren't in the car much.  What a disappointment!!  Good concept, but doesn't work well at all

Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy

For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.

On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess

It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time, he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere.  I tried it a few more times after that and got same result.  The lid is WAY too easy to remove.

This product is absolutely useless.  Save your money.  The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it.  In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever.  So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.  So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout

I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase.

I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"

I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove

We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept

If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you.  Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting).  I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not.  She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well.  Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter

I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead.

I don't have an abundance of money, but I would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better. I don't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets... From what I understand, these are the only sheets that fit the thing, so I guess I'm just out of luck. Hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon.

The product says that around 20 weeks you should be able to hear the baby's heartbeat.  Well, I'm 30 weeks now and I still can't hear the baby's heartbeat while using it.  It was a total waste of money.

doesn't dry your bottles at all. It leave a condensation and doesn't dry completely. I give it one star for all the stuff it holds, but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it.

I researched many car seats and settled on this one. Safe and cute! But it has a *major* flaw:

The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat. My daughter, only five months old, was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out. This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight, forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone. 

I asked around online on some forums, and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons. Many mothers didn't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs, but it was a problem for me already, because we use cloth diapers, so my baby's butt is bigger due to the 'padding.'

This car seat wouldn't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers... and even otherwise, I can't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so... The Britax Roundabout has the croth belt at a different location, a few inches further out from the back of the seat, so it is the one I am getting as a replacement

Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.  I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either.  I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently.

I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it.  But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy.  After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL.  Piece of junk.

We should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them (eventually cancelled one).  We would not recommend this item.

After only one wash (despite having followed the laundry instruction), it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib.  When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress, they tore..

I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it, it's made of soft, natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby. However, after washing it, I found it's too small for the crib mattress, which is a standard size. I think they just skimped on material, or didn't pre-wash. It's a good 2 inches too short! It doesn't have much stretch to it, so I'm afraid I won't be able to use it all! Very disappointing

Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly.

I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old.

The Tubbly Bath Dispenser fit our spout just fine, but minutes later it would work itself off.  We tried everything to get it to work with no luck.  Fortunately, the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging.  Don't even try it...it's not worth it!  Look for something else.  There are other faucet covers out there

Pinched my daughter's tush (even though it was opened all the way, it bent as she was getting on). She never went near it again. Have to be very careful as child is sitting down.

I Bought this product for my 3yr. old.  At first I thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times.  At first she didn't want to sit on it again &amp; she cried when I took her to the bathroom, but I told her I would sit her on it &amp; I would lift her off.  Since I have been doing this she hasn't been pinched, but it took me a while for her to trust me. If you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched

This seat is very dangerous and set my daughter's potty training back months. The seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it! Thank goodness I was still holding her! She did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after! Potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse! The only reason I gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one

When I ordered this product, I was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it. I was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it. This happiness only lasted two days before the mobile, lights, and music stopped working. I am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product. I have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby.

For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing

I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag."  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!

After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!

I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.

I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them

I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly

If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others

These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom.  The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff.  I lost three bags of milk due to leaks.  If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags.  They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions.  I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.

The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying. 
I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy

I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.

I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest.  These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do.  These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).

Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them.  They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own.  Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease.  I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me.  Simple, clean and easy.

I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful.  The twist-tie closure is complicated.  They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing.  I recommend the Lansinoh bags.  They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing.  You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer.  They pour great - no spills!

Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOL 

My daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOL

We used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth

Unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber.  When I called the company (I use these cloth diapers in my business) to ask, they told me this was the same product.  It is not. They quilt and wrinkle after one washing, and just don't hold up their shape in general.  Amazon needs to update their site, because the packaging has changed as well.  I miss the old diapers!

The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve.  I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley
different diaper.  These are thicker, better quality and have blue stitching and "Gerber" stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers.  The diapers I got were thinner, plain white and had no stamp. Buyer beware!  You will not get what you see in this current photo

I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child.  They hold plenty and have held up pretty well.  the ones I havn't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years!  These aren't as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper, trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail.  these are the best diapers sold in stores

After trying almost every bottle, I tried these and waht a nightmare! There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back

We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well.
1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag.
2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic?
3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant

I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping, since it was recommended from a friend. However it doesn't work for me. I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag. After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn't like it and tried to return it. The company would only issue store credit because I "opened" it. What a rip off

My baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing.  She cried everytime we put her in it.  It really does not provide a full swing motion.  She tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction

I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.

The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds. 

My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you

We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off. 
Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand

I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up. 

Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing

The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off.

This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, "Sorry, you are out of warranty" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller

I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.

I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.

That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing.  I only wish it were better made and more thought out.

I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom. 

I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay. 

I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!

This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born.  I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice, I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life!  I had the worst time with this bottle!  It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast.  SHe would also gag and had horrible gas! I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better.  It ended up being the same problems again!!  I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding!  My daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula!   Even though it is a little more work with the drop in system, I dont care!  I can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less!

I was really disappointed in this "Sealy Ultra". It does not feel like a very good mattress. We'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better. I'd say you need to see the mattress, decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet

I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store.  The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover.  The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.  The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck.  I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece.  If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great

I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer

I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one

I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$

This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best

I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm.  I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice.  First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT

I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!!  
  
 Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o

Okay, maybe I should have read the laundering instructions, which say to machine wash and then "drip dry" - but who makes BABY items that can't be machine dried? How many parents have the time to line-dry delicates?

The upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE - the first time we ever washed it. If you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting, this is NOT your product. Grrr

I bought this for an older model Graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it.  The mattress measures 27" x 39" and before washing it my husband and I tried it out to see if it fit.  It's too small.  I know it's supposed to be snug but the mattress won't even lay flat with this sheet on it.  It seems like it'd be a great product, if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly.

My son is 8 months old.  He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing.  I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat.  It does not help in this regard at all.  In fact, it just annoys him.  I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.

Very disappointed in Californi

I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.)

The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months, the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams (thus patch would not work).  Kel-Gar does not warranty the product, and the store that the tub came from (via amazon) only offered a 90 day warranty.  

Also, the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub, the rest flows behind it.  Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill

We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered.  Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered. On route the formula fell off a UPS truck and was lying in the street for over a day.  A neighbor saw it and gave it to us. Baby Because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it. We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day.  They said it wasn't our concern and to just give it back

I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it.  My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce

I only have the turtle and the fishing net.  
Turtle:  The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it.  I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months.  I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water.  There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle.  I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings.  I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem. 
Fish net:  The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use.  The fish themselves are fine.

A great idea, but very time-consuming to put on.  My advice is to use a regular Maya type sling for the first few months, and then get the Patapum.  It's the least pricey of the "structured" carriers which are the ONLY ones that put the weight on your hips, rather than your shoulders, and therefore spare your spine.

1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion.
2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top.
I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them.
On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of.

My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux (she doesn't vomit, it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn).  She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old.  They were horrible!  We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!

You have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold. Not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you are wiping, then put your hands back in to get another wipey

I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design

My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth.  We don't really like it.  Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe.  That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change!  (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full.  But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half.  We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child.  It wore out around the time we started potty training her.  That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one

We have the All Clear Swing Gate (hardware-mounted, not pressure-mounted) installed at the top of our basement stairs. Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand.

Fortunately, enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance (just!) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs. But it was a close thing. An inch or a pound or a second either way and I -- or, god forbid, one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured. While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge, the gate itself, which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge, fell off and tumbled down the stairs.

The gate has been in place for six weeks, but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks. NB this was a product failure, not an installation fault. The screws are still firmly attached to the wall, along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge. 

I purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here, but after my experience tonight, I would not recommend that anybody buy this gate, ever. (The review gives one star, because NO stars is not an option).  And I would expect to see a product recall very soon

I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose. If you use these mats, the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents. DON'T BUY!

I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work.  The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed. My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better

First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it. First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable.

Buy anything.  Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result.  I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible.  I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!!  So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying "HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls!  I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains.  This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online.  I feel like throwing a party when it gets here.  I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house.

I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!

We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars.  It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc.  We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid.  Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model.  WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER.  As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it.  I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model.  This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it.  HORRIBLE

This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs

This cute turtle was terrific for about a week.  My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options.  Unfortunately, the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use.  I was the one pressing the button when it came off, and I wasn't being rough or using excessive force.  We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily.  For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle, but then the rubber sensor fell off as well.  With no way to turn the thing on, we threw it away.  My toddler was sooooo sad, but it was worthless to us.  Since this is overall a popular product, I suppose we just had bad luck.  I wouldn't buy another one, though

We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets.  
My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping.
I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast.  Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels.  
I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat.  He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor.  
He was bleeding.
THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!!
This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him.
We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet.  We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar.  It is not!  It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place.  She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing!  I would not purchase this product

  We went through three of these before we finally gave up.  Our poor baby was crying and we didn't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night.  I luckily am a light sleeper.  Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near.  We bought a cheaper,  safety first brand and have not had any problems

While sometimes this works well, I'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that wasn't there when I went to bed.  It doesn't matter what channel it's on.  I also get a random drumroll sound frequently. 

If you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap, then I highly recommend this

We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first, however after about 2 months the 1st receiver, (it came with two), just suddenly stoped working! I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen, but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working! There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we're not the only family having problems. Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model

The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs. my daughter is only 27lbs. and it could not hold her. While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not. After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier. I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs. I love it. 
Also, the cross terrain claim to " Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent's shoulder and onto hips" it does not. I was in horrible pain after about an hour. in both my upper and lower back. I suggest you don't waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and  Kelty. 
This will work for a smaller child, but only if you can compfortably carry the weight. I did like the easily adjustable seat and back. I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands.

I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product.

I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.   

I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.

I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.    

I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase.

I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one.

We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit.  She's had gas and discomfort with all of them.  I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas.  But they leak horribly.  Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.  

A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.  

I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience.

I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles.  Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!!  The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them.  She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot.  Don't waste time or money with Avent!

I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product.  With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem.  We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples.  However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.  

The leak is not just a spot here or there.  It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap.  I know many people who have had the same problem.

For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.  

Don't waste your money

When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation

Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant.

Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their "holes" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big "footprint". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table

Shoppers beware:
The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders:
1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled.
2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out.
3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them

I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.

We bought this car seat (and the snap 'n go) based on good reviews (not the ones listed here). It did not meet our expectations. I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it. Otherwise, I have a hard time finding positive things to say. It is way too heavy. Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days, it was heavy to carry around. Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months, it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time. The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work. On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop. When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend. I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn't need the support in the grocery cart---that is really the only reason I still use it

My husband and I recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy. The noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby.  We were greatly disappointed

We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy

We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves

We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate.

I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them.

I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look.  I brought it home, put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds.  I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds.  I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music.  I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great.  It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable

I had purchased the Dr. Brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness.  They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most.  By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else. 

At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks - 
*using only all dry parts for each new bottle
*not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside
*not overfilling

After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides!  Finally, the answer to the leaks!!!  

Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun.  These items were meant for baby use, and for the price  it should help make babies' & mom's life easier.

Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners.  Thank you & Good Luck

We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time

I recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back. They say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not that well fitted. They are paper thin. Apparently Graco hasn't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality! I purchased the Koala portable sheets which were cheaper, thicker, and truly are fitted with elastic! Don't waste your money on these

We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both.  The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package.  After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse.  It has strings hanging all over it.  It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible! A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality)

I loved the gate. So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate, I needed the extension. It was well worth it. My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it, and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway. I am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall. This gate was a great purchase

An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this

When your infant is crying because he's hungry and you're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed, you will not necessarily hear the very quiet "click" another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit.  Did it already cycle through once?  Twice?  I don't know.  I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out.  Yes, it was in plain sight, but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time.   
What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there, reagrdless of it being 4oz. or 8oz., makes the formula very HOT. Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions.  Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby. 
This went in the trash.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil.  Otherwise, I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem

I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one

I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did. 

Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.

One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.

I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub.

For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items.  This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work.  We were wrong.

The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners.  The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates.  Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together.  My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.   
The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled.  Never tried it again.  If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.  

Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again.  Granted it might work for some, but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub.

This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc.

However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue

At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them

First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on?  Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick.  I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick.  Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things?  They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid.  Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long.  Give me the regular bottles any day.  
PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield!  I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there

Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting.
We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement.
There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up!
It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat.

After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)

I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old.  I could barely zip it around b/c it is so small.  I keep checking the tags to make sure I got the right size and not the infant one.  I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem.  It's a great product for smaller children

Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing.  Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket.  I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchki

This product is a good idea however:

1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish      
   with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.

2. Can't be put in the Micro.

3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.

4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use a 
   butter knife to pry open).

5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.

6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.

Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product

Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it.

We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them. Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway. After only 5 or 6 uses however, the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago. 

I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem, but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product. They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase (and you have to have proof of purchase). They did offer to send me out a replacement part, but under the circumstances, I don't feel comfortable using the seat at all, so I'll be destroying and disposing of it. I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat, but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem. 

Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash, or my son certainly would have been seriously injured. We haven't had any problems yet with the other seat, but I'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe. After their horrible customer service, I won't be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again.

I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better

We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.

We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it "air out" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.

We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product

After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats, I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit. The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it. No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey, I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort. For now, I'm sticking with the Britax

In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving? 

Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January.

The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there. 

It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us "That should be in there real good, now." We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, "Oh they all do that, that's normal."
Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it. 

Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car. 

Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard.

Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation.

Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more.

I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car.  I thought the lights and music would distract him.  After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry.  It is far less irritating.  The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work.  What genius engineered that?  Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money!!

I bought this product as I was going on a long trip.  I put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work.  I put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work.  All that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you couldn't even turn it off without taking out the batteries.  WASTE OF MONEY!

CONS
*WON'T STAY IN PLACE
I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck.
*WHY A REMOTE?
Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride? 
*THE IRRITATING SONG 
too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting)
*LEARN WHAT?
I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car...

PROS
*Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained..

These are a complete waste of money.  The nipples flow too fast for a newborn.  I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding.  She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours.  The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space

Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.
They also flow too fast for newborns

I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.

I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!

This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious. I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back. It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders. Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight. Don't waste the money I would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer. 

The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci's, keys, money and cell.

I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.

When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. 

So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore

I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months.  In 2005, I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places.  It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile, BUT... the trapdoors have broken TWICE.  I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement.  That free replacement broke less than 6 months later.  You can't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken!  This week, I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is $10.  I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke.  Unfortunately, it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so. I am an engineer and I don't know what to say, except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable.  Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system, instead of relying on $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle!  Now I have to decide whether to spend $10 on another replacement, try to fix it myself, get a different pail or maybe none of the above.  At what point is enough, enough?

I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).

However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient.

The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two "trap doors" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these "trap doors" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing.

Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer.

Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape.

Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner.

Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better

We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived.  We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive.  We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee.  Don't buy it.  The guarantee or the pail!
It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it.  We have kept it in the garage, and also outside.  Not convenient.  Refills are expensive.  And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing???

I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink.  But that's not how it works.  It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat!  The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times.  Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby.  I am returning this item

I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket.  After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead.  Boy, was that a bad decision.  We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds!  Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket.  I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier

This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU

We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously

Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke.  Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place.  We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use.  Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs.  Argh!!!

Please spend your money on a different gate.  There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate.  We have twin girls in a bi-level house.  A stair gate is a must.  The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days.  Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn.  I will say - when it worked, it was nice.  But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again.  Shame on me for buying it again.  It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use.  I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere.  If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design.  Again, please look elsewhere

As with all other reviews, our gate worked well for a while then the latch broke as well.  There is no way to fix it.  The company did nothing to help us with the situation, except to suggest that we buy an whole new one.  No thanks!

I would encourage anyone who has purchased this gate to send your complaints to the company, as I am doing.  Though the company says they have made improvements to the product, the gates are still breaking and should be recalled.  Their representative told me there is no reason to recall the gates since it is not a safety issue, however, they advertise its use for the top of stairs!  I called The First Years, and they said to send your complaints to:

This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash

The baby bjorn is a nice carrier. I received one for my baby shower. However, I hardly used it. I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much. Before that, the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby. But probably the same problem for other carriers. I was really surprised by how little I used it, since I really wanted to carry my bab

I wouldn't let my dog sleep on these sheets.  They are of the worst quality imaginable.   We took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit PERFECTLY.  I recommend the Koala Baby name brand porta rib sheet.  They are available at BRU and have elastic all the way around, making for a snug fit.  And the quality is 1000 times improved over the PNP sheets

don't buy this sheet!!  it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper!  spit up would go right through it.

i have a much better solution for you--buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play.  they are a couple of $$ less and are sold as "especially for baby"(which is B-R-US house brand).  they are great.  i use them for both my son's crib and for the pack n play. they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern

The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help.  Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal.  It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in.  The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it.  The worst part was getting her out.  The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position.  I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all.  I'll be donating the swing

We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!

I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else

We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on.  The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed, but several presses got it to work a couple of times.  After about 6 uses it died completely.   Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever (like an electric kettle) is exactly, but these guys found it.

This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized

I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working.  When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more.  I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service.  They had no problem replacing the unit.  Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once.  And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row.  To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work.  Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on.  Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated.  I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was.  I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.

I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat.

   We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn't work out.  This item too didn't work for us.  It won't stick it there is a table cloth.  Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand!  It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth.

We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag...we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it.  At 14 months she doesn't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out.

I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars

I was happy when this product arrived. It arrived in great time. I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets. It states that it should be used in the last trimester, I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat. I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong. It will pick up my heart beat, but not the babys. I can't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester. The greatest thing about this is the cd's I play them for the baby every now and then

I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business

My experience has been similar to that of other reviewers. The one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro. My two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when I checked her in the middle of the night. Honestly, the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn't move their arms... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own

My baby slid both down and off the side of this.  I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner.  I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me!  She could have suffocated!  I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy

I had been told that these were wonderful, to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back. But my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides. This worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach

I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept.  The first night we used it, my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports.  He was horrified that our son could have suffocated.  This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits.

I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move at all

I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser,  but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric.  It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad.  The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable.  I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one,  just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose

This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight.  The screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks.  The rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom. I have another wipe warmer by Dex that doesn't seem to dry out the wipes and I have never seen rust

I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all, therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation. I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy. I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working. I would not recomend this pump, at least not to adoptive mothers. The customer service was awesome though!!! They were understanding and helpful. I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela.

IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.

I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.


The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!


If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.

I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.

I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry.

I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and  I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.  

I have seen this product work well on single strollers, but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes, so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid's faces.

I've used a binder clip to keep it in place, but it still blows back more than I think it should..

This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option

I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart.  It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat.  It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back.  The result is that there is no support in the back.  My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her.  Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back.  I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in.  She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much.  I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else

I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat

The size stated  3-6 months. The baby was 2 months old and the hat was too small. Anyone ordering should consider it runs very small. Then because I used my credit card to purchase it I was unable to return it and get a refund

Had to return this item.  It was way too small.  Forewarned when you order that it won't fit an average baby up to six months.  I would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most!!  It is very cute and would be a great addition to a Bundleme (cover), but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing.  More disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a $9 item.

This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space. 
  
 I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers

Monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the AC adapter.....

Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged.  In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter -- you'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing! (the fisher price rep actually told me I'd "fry it").

This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it. ALso, it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet (- from our daughter's bedroom to the kitchen). I would definitely not recommend this product, and had I not lost the receipt, I would have returned it

<review_text>
$52.00 less weighted down by cash, and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target. Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like "clear reception" and "no interference" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond. 

We hooked it up in short order, turned it on, and *SCREEEECH*. Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever. We tried shutting that monitor off, and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away. No screeching, but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can. Totally distorted, useless. You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom. 

We've packed it carefully back into the box, and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight. Needless to say, I'd steer clear of this one. Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg

I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes.  The ad said "universal fit".  Well, it fit, but second size up  car seats are taller and kind of lean back.  When you attach the canopy, it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun.  A hat better serves my child then this aparatus.  It now sits in the garage with all the other failed  baby devices

I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything!  I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training.  And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't.  Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really "go" in the potty.

We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's "potty time."  When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more.  Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.  

If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.  

Here's a suggestion:  Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training.  Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do.  With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore

We bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds...

We had several major issues with it.

1)  The pee guard.  It doesn't really latch on and STAY on.  Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room.  As luck would have it, when I would go retrieve the item, he would pee and since there was no guard, the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat/ pot.   

To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics (super glue didn't work AT ALL) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training.  It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not.  But I had no choice- the guard HAD to stay on.

2) The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing.  He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went.

3) The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting.  He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby.  I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken.

4) When he was ready to use the actual potty, we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats.  Everytime he pees I have to hold down his "bits" because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat, thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc.  The pee guard is useless for this feature. Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down, if he wiggles or moves, then he is not in position... There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes.

It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store.  We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son's potty training experience.  The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us.  Finally, I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets.  It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best.

If we have another child, I am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter.  Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating.

DON'T waste your money

I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.

I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!!

I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months.  She hated it.  The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat.  She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller.  After several months of use, the wheel fell off.  Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.  Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers.  I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied.  This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better.  I would not recommend it to another consumer

We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone.

I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story.  Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted.  I bought it because it was lightweight, had a front tray, adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color.  I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk.  Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips.  Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria:
- Poor steering.  Can not handle quick turns.
- Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun.
- 5 point harness is poorly designed.  The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled.
- My drink holder broke.
- Overpriced for features and quality.
My positives are:
- Nice looking
- Easy to fold
- Lightweight
I keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company.  Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room!  I would not buy a Peg Prego again

When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very "user-friendly."  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.

Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends. 

The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore.

I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat.  My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY.  If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat.  I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer.  Honestly, now I am skeptical of any "tummy time" mat.  I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs.  Better off spending the money elsewhere

I was initially very happy with this product.  We purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed.  However, the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use.  Since I liked the product, I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one.  It, too, broke; so I'm now looking for a sturdier alternative

I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer

My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.

I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6&quot; and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby

There are so many other sling out there.  Don't waste your timeor money on this.  I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot.  It was also impossible to adjust.  I got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these. Bottom line, check out the other options, this one is a waste of $$$

This is by far the worst sling I have ever tried!  The padding is bulky and hot.  It is impossible to adjust.  Total waste of money.  I bought a pouch from www.equanimitybaby.com and it was perfect! easy to use and very comfy.  The bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk.   If you can't use this sling, its not you, its the sling

I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it

A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down

I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.  Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby

If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product

The "Breathe Safe Padded Sheet" also left a mesh imprint on my baby's face. Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine:
1) Untying bumper guard & moving it out of the way
2) Struggling to "pull" out heavy mattress from crib
3) Removing & washing sheet & mattress pad
4) Wiping off mattress with soap & water
5) Replacing sheet & mattress pad
6) Returning heavy mattress to crib
7) Re-arranging dust ruffle
8) Re-tying bumper guard
Other than that, it seemed like a good idea. Searching for a better product.

Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off.  With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis.  I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier.  With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway.  I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple.  Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products.  By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway

When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it. When we did try that, he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face

This is a very cute bouncer chair.  However, I feel it was poorly designed.  It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys.  In addition, our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far.  We had to find one that set more upright

These bottle leak, they're expensive... and you can't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over!  Don't waist you're money - they're a pain to wash, too many pieces, and they just plain leak.  After 9 months of using them I'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else.  Plus, even with the top on, if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything

This was way too quiet, even on it's loudest setting. My infant didn't benefit from it at all. The sounds are fine, and not too repetative as with some machines, but even in a small room (really small) I found it too quiet to be effective

I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well.  This thing doesn't have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work. However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer.  It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.

The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.

My 8 1/2 mo. granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night.  I've got the correct bumper pads, etc. but babies do move.  She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset.  I've only had the crib 1 week, she's gotten her leg stuck 2 times.  We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer.

Very poor construction and does not "fit most sleigh cribs" as advertised on the box.  This company should be ashamed of themselves for charging $70 for this product.  The concept is a good idea and could be so much better, but this company fails in execution.  "Tots in Mind" definately has something in mind, however it is not your Tots.  Buyer beware

Bought this crib tent after reading all the "fine print" about returns.  Besides, toilet seats etc. which Allegro Medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons, Allegro Medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days.  Not when I tried to return this.  Allegro Medical said all returns were "up to their discretion".  They would not allow me to return this despite the fact I didn't even open the box.  Very misleading & will never buy from Allegro Medical again

The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage

The one star is for the bag it comes in. You can take these things along with you...but honestly, how many of these things will you really need? Maybe just two of them, the nail clippers and the bulb syringe...I have the set, given to me as a gift. I say, just buy these things separately, it's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you...it's more practical than buying this whole set..

I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just  not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend  more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this.

I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck.  I HATE IT!!  My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there.  Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.  Why buy extra toys??  I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys.  I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange.  What a waste of money for me.  I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too.  My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym.  Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys.

I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats.  I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall.  The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it. The playmat is cute, but it isn't functional, not to mention, WAY OVERPRICED.  The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out.  He has never liked this playmat.  I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more

We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.  The blinds don't stay up either. Their suctions don't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door.

I received a SwaddleMe as a gift.  The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son, the velcro pieces didn't meet.  In other words, the wrap was too large.  I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.  A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it.  It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well

We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.

Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.

Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.

We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.

It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.

So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now

The idea of the stroller is great. However after purchasing and using it, it isn't well equipped. There is no cup holders, the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn't even big enough to hold a diaper bag, let alone any bags when shopping. I also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk. Need less to say I don't even use it much b/c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids. I wasted my money on this.

Graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go Moms like me. Wish I would have waited. It is the same price. Wish I could have exchanged it.

I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07.  when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift.  they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time.  my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product

I have no idea why these itch, but I have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use!  I haven't had that problem with any other brand and will NOT buy these again.  I'm not continuing to wear the ones left in the box I have, but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills

I will not buy these again.  They are tiny, thick and do not tapper on the edges.  This means you will see the lines thru your shirts. The adhesive isn't enough and the pads shifted durring the night.  I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela, they cover more, are thinner and stick better.

I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)

This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive... 

The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!    

Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.  

This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!

If I could rate it no stars I would.Let me tell you that my son is now 8, and is perfectly normal, especially as a baby, but I'll tell you what YOU DON'T NEED A MICROWAVE....technically they are dangerous for the fomula,the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it HARD shake then your all set...It's that easy don't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula

I got this sterilizer because of the Avent name.  My main complaint is that the lid doesn't lock into the base when closing.  You have to use alot of power for it to close.  I have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock.

sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product.  buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well.  same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual "luxury."  more comfortable for mom and baby.  wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out.  we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it's still like new.  in another class from the "chintzie" alternatives offered at other stores

I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach.  We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun.  Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him.  One of the supports had broken.  It was the first time I'd used it.  I was very disappointed

I received this as a gift and loved it at first.  But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up.  I was bummed too because I loved it so much.  If you do buy it, be careful when you handle it - it's not as durable as it seems

I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill.  I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge.  The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment.  The printed instructions were clear-- it's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do

Some assembly is required.  I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things...  I have an engineering degree... I've put together bikes, furniture, installed car stereos, and this thing was an absolute pain, especially for such a simple device.  I found the instructions to be woefully inadequate.  

I found the images to be useless, and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together.  Takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance.

It was aggravating enough to make me go straight to Amazon upon finishing to leave feedback...  I didn't even buy it from Amazon.

The gate itself is fine

I purchased this potty for my son. I thought that the "royal" turns would give him an interest in using it, it didn't. He used it once and cried! He would not sit on it again. I was very disappointed. The potty would sing for now reason sometimes and EVERY TIME you would touch it. I do not recommend

I would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool. You don't have to clean #2 out of the cup and you'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink. It really saves a lot of hastle

My mother-in-law and I both bought this potty for my daughter.  (One for her house and one for mine.)  It was hard for me to put together, my Mo-in-Law couldn't get it together at all.  

It makes a loud trumpet sound every time "water" passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first, but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died.

The other thing I'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die, they are almost impossible to replace.  In order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart, which again is very hard to put back together.

We got ours on sale so I don't mind the expenditure.  When you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops...

My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born.  He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time.  Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds.  It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone.  The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!!  I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!!  I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this!

I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old.  I ended up returning it 3 days later.  I am a petite woman (5'2") and this item was totally uncomfortable!  I still have bruises under my arms from this item.  I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual.  It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits.  I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am.  NOT WORTH THE MONE

The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl

This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago.  We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well.  It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be.  I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump & Go).  People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier.  Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump & Go version a lot

I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.

I should have checked this out before registering for it.  The lid won't stay shut, the bottom wipes brown, the unit leaks.  I contacted the manufacturer.  When telling him about the lid not staying shut, he asked, "are you sure there isn't a ghost in the house"...they offered to replace it if I returned it to them,  offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products.

After reading these reviews I think I'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product

We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes... that is... until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day.  It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom.  Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model, but after searching online, I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had, and now have decided to buy a different brand.  I did keep the water filled, and still had a poor experience.  Save your money and invest in a different brand

This wipe warmer is more trouble than it's worth.  The water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table.  As a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes.  I emailed the manufacturer regarding this product  to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective.  They failed to respond

This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move. We use cloth wipes it has burned a few, smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it (never happened with any of our other wipes warmers) won't stay closed. It actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it. Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table. GET a different warmer this one is awful

We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money

I have 2 wipes warmers - one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  At one point, I had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work - mine took FOREVER to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section; same as previous reviews, the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly.  I have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine.  Do not waste your money on the Munchkin warmer

This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won't stay closed.  I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table.  The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid.  Don't buy this wipe warmer, there are better ones out there.

I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this

I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks.  At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it

This toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move.  It ends up moving all around and I can not see in the mirror.  The plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat.

I just took a course from the Florida Highway Safety program.  I thought something like this would be wonderful, especially for little ones in the rear facing position.  I was dead wrong.  Anything put in front of, on the side of, in fact, anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash.  This toy, even latched down, poses a threat to the baby.  He or she may just have to be bored for a while.  On long trips have Mom or Dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment

This is very cute but my baby is chubby. It gave him a cut and bruises on both legs. The seat isn't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off. I wish it was bigger cause this is really cute. So if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts

I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple. The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable, although leakage city!  My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps

I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance.  After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor.

The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.  

The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).  We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the "blowouts", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean.  It has been a wonderful new baby tool

Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle

I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her!
Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund

I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in, but really, it took up too much counter space.  I ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as I personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary, I found.

I bought this potty seat for my daughter and I took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets. The second I put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet! The seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets, that is a lie. My toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through. A waste of money and a safety hazard

I bought this product for childproofing purposes.  I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it.  Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms.

This is a great gate if you have a strong, healthy back and always have two hands available.  But how many people with kids have both of those!  It was great at keeping my baby in the room, but my 4 year old couldn't open it and neither could her grandma.  And it made me and my husband want to cuss.  It is back in the box and in the return pile.  Don't waste your money.

The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger. 
I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm

I bought this sling when I was still pregnant.  After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet.  When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this!  I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful.  First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby.  I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again

My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..

I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster.

We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething. One day, she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth. the metal from one of the bells cut her lip! We let her play with the other ones still, but the one with the bells is put away at least until she's older

Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it

Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).  

When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position.

CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy.

Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name "Jeep" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better

Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of "occasional use." I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump

I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.

For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:

TRY THIS ONE IF...
- You have a very abundant milk supply
- You only plan to pump one or twice a month
- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period

INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...
- You're going back to work
- Your milk supply is medium to low
- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month
- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)

Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)

I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time

This was the second pump I purchased. I was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand I bought. This pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the AC plug in is much weaker than the other side. The motor died out after 2 weeks of use. This pump is not meant for everyday use. I just bought a Medala and I hope to have a better expeirence with it

I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump. This is a bad breast pump. I couldn't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples. It has very poor suction, is a pain to put together, and is uncomfortable to use. [...] So don't waste your time and money buy something different. If I could have rated this a negative I would have

This is the worst pump you could buy.  I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down.  It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work.  PLEASE don't waste your money.......  I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product.  If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing.  I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product

I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. 

I will simply list the things I do not like:
1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had.
2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any.
3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary).
4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those.
5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks.
6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.

I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! 

But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to.

The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too...

Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. 

On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price..

I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;

Ok, this chair is fine except for two very important things.  One: the tray is huge, and not in a good way, in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way. Also, the two trays that fit on top, that are dishwasher safe, ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER!!! So what's the point???
Two: it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY, rather than on the chair...making it impossible to set down anywhere when it's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair.  Everything else, about the chair is great, but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair.  I'm bought the one that's made by the famous toy maker, and love it

I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror.

I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can't hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby's face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan.  He's in an infant car seat though and I couldn't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror. I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest.  I'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now. Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn't bother.  On the window, it would be held by suction and I really don't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby

I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby.  Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash.  So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless.  I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in.  Don't waste your money

I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy.  Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva.  Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc.  I just don't see the difference in that and not using it.  My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc.  I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material!  My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.  You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth

Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare

I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for.  It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic). 
I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled.  It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't.  It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles.  Ahhhhh

This item is misleading because it runs VERY small.  I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG!  I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen.  Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help.  If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine). It is definately made for taller, longer-torso women (aka 6 ft. models). I would go with another type of support if given another chance

If I could have given this no stars I would have. This product in L-XL only fits a pre-pregnancy 28"-34" waist. And in sizes that only goes up to a 18. So now I'm on the search for something a little bit bigger.  So if your pre-pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side, dont waste your money or time by getting this

I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first "big girl" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed

I am so disgusted that I woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a Dora toddler bed. I held the Dora toddler bed until christmas, when on Christmas eve I went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong  and I was unable to assemble the bed at all. I ended up returning the bed, in exchange fr nothing. I found out that they no longer carry the bed.

I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. &#60;br /&#62;
What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child

My son, who was used to using a wood stool (8" tall with slick wood feet) fell climbing up on this because the top (foot area) is too small and it tipped on him!  It's only 6" wide on top.  Not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on.  If you push it in toward the toilet there is NOTHING left for the child to stand on.  If you leave it out, then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste.  Getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top.  

His feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet - not coming near the top of this 8 1/2" tall stool.

This is advertised as being 10" tall (actually 8 1/2") 14" long (correct, but top surface is only 11 1/2") and 10" wide (also correct but again, it is only 6" wide on top)

The rubber feet are great for non-skid purposes, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this.

I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!

I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it

We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase.  First of all, we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work, since they make you order each little piece separately.  We spent all night putting it together and it didn't work for us.  The actual gate is very small, I don't see how it would be big enough for any opening.  Even with the extension kit, it was still not long enough.  The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart.  It is a very poor design and way overpriced.  We spent over $150 (with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart.  Save your money and buy a different gate

I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen.  Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes it impossible to close with one hand. Even if you don't care about the one-hand feature, it is still a hassle to adjust.  I do not suggest buying this gate.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards.  It was not sturdy at all, returned it

I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area. I was totally wrong!!! Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand. Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry, 'cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it. Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose, so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly, the bottom one is to lose and not secure. I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it, only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes. I would have returned this gate, but I trashed the box before I installed it

I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags

I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child

The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts

I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib.  I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards

I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed.
I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon

This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months

I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came.  Well, the "mattress" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry.  I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all.  I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface.  Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed.  If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars.  I'm so let down by this product

This is a great product for a few weeks, then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out!  I go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out.  No matter how tight I make the blanket, the velcro comes apart.  I encourage you to buy their other SwaddleMe blanket with the larger velcro flap.

I received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow.  Although the tag reads "100% cotton," it is most certainly not the soft, 100% jersey cotton advertised.  The print is cute, but I was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling.  I gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising, but if one is looking for a nice, regular cotton crib sheet, this would probably be okay

Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial.  It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth.  Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing.  I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.

This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.  Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap

This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son.  So since I got it and used it.  My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged.  It was one of the worst experiances.  I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby.  I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one.  I am know expecting again and looking for a pump.  I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again

I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant).  My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser.  For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway.  My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel "too snug" in it.  They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep.  If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it

We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture

My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0

We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.

We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex

I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.

We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it!  With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand

I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first. I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out. The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest...I have an average build but have a chest....and it would'nt reach. My friend tried it also and had the same problem. I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake

Reasons why I do not like this potty:

1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty!
2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways.
3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty.
4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess.

I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield

Though this potty is nicely priced, it's worth it to buy a more expensive one.  Though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers, it does shift around on the base, allowing for spillage.  The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat, so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside, not just in the receptacle.  The inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it's impossible to clean messes out of it.  It does serve it's purpose as a potty, but I'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one

I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart.
Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!

I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go".  It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty.  There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning.  Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy

I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son.  When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable.  I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face.  So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference.  It didn't.  He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz.  I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all.  A big disappointment.  If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn.  A million times better than this

I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.

Rather than this sling... I recommend you check out [...] for your sling.  They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors.  This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier

When my daughter was tiny, she enjoyed being in this sling... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes. The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose.

I'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo. old son weighs 28 lbs. and should be able to stay in it for alot longer (up to 40 lbs.). The straps are let all the way out and it's still too tight for him. I wouldn't recommend this car seat for chunky babies.

and had problems with it from the beginning. The cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached. Evenflo did replace it after I sent pictures. The shade protector doesn't stay up. I had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter. I wish I had checked safety ratings and reviews before I purchased this product.

The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up

I loved the idea that this car seat was. Then after I bought it I have had problems with it. The handle realse has broken many times. Then the gray handle part  has came apart also. This is has not been safe at all. I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me. I think it was a waste of money

The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty

The idea is good...but it does not sit well on oblong toilets. The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus.
Would recommend with round toilet only

The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea, but the plastic is very flimsy, and when set in place, it just barely reaches the floor. It's a pretty unstable situation. A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better

It's not just the most icredible piece of junk I ever seen, it is the most DANGEROUS piece of junk I ever seen on the market for kids.
The plastic is very thin, very weak and bends every each way. My daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight. Is SLIDES off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child's weight, which really frightened my girl.
 There's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat. 

I feel soooo stupid to have bought it((

I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product

We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected

I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray.  Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl.  Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well.  The littlest one doesn't even stick to that.  None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.

On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them.  Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use.  They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher

I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose

I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal.
I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing.
BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature

The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat.  They do come in lovely colors, though

I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately. I always follow the measuring instructions, but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot, even though I have been practicing to get it right. I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me, who only has a 3 room apartment, the cooling feature is not that useful

I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one....

Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product

WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly.
First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write.
But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot.
And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time

I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap".
To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...

After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno

I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.

I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive.
You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference.
I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety

I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features.  However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward.  I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking.  Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before.  I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem.  I am truly disappointed.  Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears.  I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue.  I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem.  HELP!!!

I bought this doll because at the expensive price, I figured it would be the best.  It definitely is not.  Patty is cute, but that is the only good thing about her.  To fill up her bottles, you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water, then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again.  It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water, no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes.  Then, to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle, where she is almost standing up.  Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms, but Patty will not drink in that position.  Even in the standing up position, most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit.  It takes 5-10 minutes to fill Patty up.  Most children don't have the patience for this and lose interest, as my daughter did.  Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle, only an adult can feed Patty her water.  Then, to make her pee, you must press her thigh very hard.  This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty.  Once I assured her Patty was ok, then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee.  My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier.  At 35 months old, my daughter was not able to fill the bottles, feed Patty or make her pee.  Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty.  So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles.  The whole "teach the doll to pee" part of the potty training was lost.  I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead.  Then I e-mailed the company to complain, but of course received no response.  And you can't get a full refund if the doll has been used.  In fact, getting a refund at all is extremely difficult, I have just given up on that.  Don't waste your money.  This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child, which defeats the whole purpose.  Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll.  At least that way, if you don't like it you can return it, unlike Patty

Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy.  The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!).  My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old.  And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off.  Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with.  I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts.  I would recommend that you do not buy this item.  I now have to waste more time returning it to the store

I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first.  My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor.  It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller.  The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm.  I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off

After only 2 months this toy fell apart. My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams. $20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better

These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because "they had already replaced the items". Be careful when ordering from this site

My son is ten days old. I tried these bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners are a pain in the butt. Once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it, if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again. I changed to Dr. Brown's bottles and my son is having less gas and isn't wearing his food.

So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.  

Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart

This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only.  If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it.  I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong.  It hardly covers anything.  I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat

This pump sucks--literally

I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima.  Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.  

The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert ("blue" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.  

I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.  I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options.  :(

I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily). Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend. My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me. Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced "just the pump" in the pack with a new one. 
Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back. 
Another thing that is happening is my back pack's handles have started wearing down. And I hardly carry them around.
I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump.
I would think twice before buying this

I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year.

Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.

For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.

We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.

Like you, I read all the reviews I could of bottles, travel systems, baby swings, cribs, etc etc etc.  I loved the shape of these bottles (very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding), and the concept of the "ventaire" system made a lot of sense!  HOWEVER, 2 months into using these bottles, I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts, drying them thoroughly (it's a MUST with these things), and having to "activate" BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal; wasting valuable time and energy that should've been spent with my family, catching up on laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and grabbing naps in-between (I also work a full-time job and didn't get home till 6 PM every night).  The WORST of all of it is that if you don't install the vent juuuuuuust so, it leaks...the person (below) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it on right, hasn't met me - I'm 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap!  It's a "hit or miss" deal...sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue...water EVERYWHERE!!! (and they're slow leaks too, so it's not like you would notice right away...it took like 30 minutes before showing)  Then I called Playtex to ask them what the problem was, and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material...so, they kindly sent me some new ones.  Well, yeh, THAT didn't work either!!!  It is a GREAT idea, but VERY bad design!!!  I finally threw my hands in the air...and purchased Evenflo's version of the "angled bottle" and now I am in HEAVEN!!!  Do yourself, and your time, a favor and don't waste the money

I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently.  My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all.  Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months

I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used.  They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her.  She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast.  They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages.  Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back

I thought this cover was horrible.  It doesn't cover enough area of the cart.  It's difficult to put on because of all the ties.  I couldn't even get the harness to fit right.  Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic, you can put them on the cart with one hand, and it completely covers the cart, even the big ones at Costco

You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product

I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same.  Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on.  Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart.  There is an opening, that my baby's fingers always find, where he can touch the icky cart handle.  Not a great product.  Spend the extra money and buy the better one

This product serves its purpose, but does not need to cost almost $30!  Basically, it's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it. I'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well, if not better, if you take the time to look

I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue.

I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected.  The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but I don't quite get how to adjust this.  It also says that there is a blanket.  Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here.  I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does.  At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1/2 inches thick.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby's sleep problems

1) Like others here, my charges do not last more than 5 hours.  The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger).

2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  "Cycling" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.  Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal.

Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated.  My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story "box" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.  So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery.

Poorly designed (operator interface, controls, directions and trouble-shooting), poorly engineered (poor reception, enormous static, fast battery drain) and poorly manufactured (apparent faulty parts and lack of quality) product

I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday. (only available in store at Babies R Us).  It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children.  Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back.  

Pro:
-The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside.
-No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference.
-Easy to setup.
-Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony)
Cons:
-Controls are not very straightforward.
-The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated.
-The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on.
-The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.  With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the "off" mode.  You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on.  Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red.

We have been using the Sony 910 for 3 years with our first child.  I guess it has spoiled us

My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child, and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed.  We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in, but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage.  

This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors, but you certainly don't get what you pay for here.  

Pros:

1.  You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range (see cons for a further explanation)

Cons:

1.  The biggest complaint I have is the battery life.  Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting, you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge.  You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge.  This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night.  The nursery unit is even worse, as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in.  Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me.  Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times.

2.  I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit.  They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range.  This required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct.

3.  The range is not ideal.  I have a 2800 square foot, 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit.  Granted, the units were about as far away as they can be in our house, but considering this distance was only about 60 feet, I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house.

4.  As other reviewers have noted, the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper.  Since the speaker is always on, you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit.  Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume (i.e. if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib).  Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room.  

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.  We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a $100 baby monitor, although I'm sure I would be much happier with a different product.  

If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time, then this product would probably suffice, although I'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well

I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors.  The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery.  And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it.  I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out.  There is tons of static and extra noise.  Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much.  Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!!  Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend!

I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:
To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. 
The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. 
In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case.
So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. 
I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system.

We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..

This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.  
At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.  Her sister's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys, an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use

I purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago, and I have used it all of two times. It creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted, and I really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized. I am terribly disappointed with this product, and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind

It does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water. It is worse if you use tap water. It doesn't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed.
When you lift the cap all the water drip. You will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use.
The plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat. You wonder if it is going to melt. 
I am a fan of Gerber products, but this one does not work

I got this to make sterilizing easier. I'm not sure it does. It is kind of a pain. Cartoonish in appearance, cheap looking, cheap feeling,not nearly enough room for what you have to put in, you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things. Water does spill like crazy from the lid. Does it really sterilize? I hope so! I can't tell. Air vent bottles air dry, but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have. Why? I don't know, the steam? Metal of heating unit isn't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don't get cut! I was VERY disappointed! For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality! You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure!

We just learned in Parenting class (and I checked with my pediatrician) that you don't need to sterlize bottles, nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher. So save some money and don't get this!

I received this steralizer as a gift. If I had to do all over again I would have never put it on my registry. The steralizer is messy; everytime I lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere. In addition I have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out... there has to be a better way

I was given this as a gift, so thankfully I didn't waste my money on it.  This sterilizer is so messy and awkward, that I can not recommend it at all.  The metal pan started corroding after only a week.  Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop.  All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty, so I can't imagine how it could possibly clean.  Horrible product

This is the worst nursing pad that I've tried.  It slips out of place, and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it.  I found myself with wet bras all the time!  These pads are terrible!  I recommend the Lansinoh brand.

These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).

I received a box as a shower gift, and they worked okay, unless I changed them a lot though, they ended up leaking. I was resigned to just living with wet spots, until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try. I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn't arry them, but they really need to. These things absolutely do not leak, they hold tons of liquid

Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily

We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks.  We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit.  I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off.  An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony.  We regret not reading the reviews before buying it.

If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for

Due to the fact that you can't give 0 stars, I had to choose a 1, otherwise it would have been a big fat 0!!! We bought this mattress when I was pregnant, thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong. A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping, mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers, no toys, nothing sharp, etc. Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter, and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out. My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!! Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do!!! 

From a mom who learned the hard way!

I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.

I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.

What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.  

While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.

The first one of these I had came apart at every seam the first time I washed it.  I returned it and got another I was pleased with until about the 6th washing, and now IT is starting to fall apart.  They just don't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure.

I really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in, however the quality of the material is less than desirable. The cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier. I expected some shrinkage, but it seems excessive. I still use the covers but am disappointed overall. The material is not very soft so admittedly I will look around for other products

I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating

I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore, they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad. i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great, unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily. and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white

Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart.

For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.  

Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.

This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat.

I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment.

1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap
2. My nipples are still sore
3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump

If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product

Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position. The wheels have a mind of their own. The handles make it hard to go up curbs. Hard to close up, need both hands and foot.

But can fit a Graco infant car seat, compact fold, and light

We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly.
Our children are 2.5 and 10 months.  Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support.  Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric.  The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when  my two kids were in it.  It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!

But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)
Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore

The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price

I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women

We haven't yet put the bed together so it might be great but I gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it didn't!  This was a common complaint in reviews.  Two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped.  It did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well.  There is a phone number to call if parts are damaged.  We'll do that soon.  I'll update this review if everything is fixed

We received this item as a Xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken.  My two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor.  The legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item.  We were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a Step 2 product.

Unless your baby has very long legs, they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water. My son is 1 and cannot reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat. However, he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when I am trying to buckle him into his seat.

Also, I have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it, and I am not finding a way to put new water into it. The floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated - and it's kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat

Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child.  This gate is all look and no function.  It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it.  If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work.  I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together.  I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6" then drilling two holes about 4" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something.  Good luck!!

I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide.  Within one week of use, the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable.  I am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type.  This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for

I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!!  Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up.

I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.

PROBLEMS: 

1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory.
2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks. 
3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week.
4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing.
5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know." 

Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer. 

My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers.

I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal "cheap" single stroller, instead.

This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out. 
Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well.

I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews.  I'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later.    
Problems:
The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull  
The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park) 
The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios
The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six "buttonholes" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag
The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right
The shades are very small and next to worthless
The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller

For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel.  It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.  If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience.  A shame

I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second

I bought this stroller for when we had our second child.  My children are 19 mo. apart.  I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it.  This one is definitely not the same.  For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.

If you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you.  But just try turning and especially sharp turns--you'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way.

My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.

Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great..

This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink.
And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail.
The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken

I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive.  Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for.  Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in.  I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk!  I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie.  I hope this will work out much better

I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.  

After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off.  I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half.  I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First.  They only had the blue top without the spring.  The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top

This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail

My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.  

Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.

I would not recommend this product

Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided.

Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down. If the smell isn't a problem for you, go for it. But if you're picky with the smell, research something else

I was very excited to finally recieve this stroller, but after I put it together (which was pretty simple), it was very heavy and bulky to handle. I was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon.  I bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution. 
I was not able to load it in the back of mt SUV due to the size and weight, and it is very long and hard to steer. Anyone considering the Ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney.
It does not accomodate my Evenflo carrier either, so I would have needed to also purchase the Graco carseat.
I am returning the stroller to Amazon today

I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item!  These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter.  I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad.  Fortunately there are other products that work better...if this was the only option, I might as well not have a sheet on at all.

I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser, which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience.  I was very disappointed.  The lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap.  I used it for about a week and then got rid of it

The problems I had with this gate:

1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly.
2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break.
3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.

Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it. As for the locking mechanism, it's annoying, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse.

This gate would not be safe for kids

If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.

This gate is absolutely worthless.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  It was difficult to install and is very flimsy. I have it at the top of the stairs and I don't trust that it will hold at all. I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one.

This is the flimsiest gate ever.  To boot it is not cheap.  I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate.  I had to use nails and duck tape.  The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together.  Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good.  So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate.  So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled.  This gate isn't even worth $1.0

This gate is horrible to try to open and close... don't try to pinch pennies when it's your little one's safety and YOUR convenience at stake.  Buy the Configure Gate instead... you'll be glad you did.  It is well worth every penny... this one isn't worth a thing

I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe.  Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever.  The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.  

This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).  

We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional.

These retail now for $229 at BRU. Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit!

This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego!  All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :).

I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store?

It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too!

Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2.

Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price

The design is pretty narrow. My 3-4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described. The product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry. Unless you have a very small and quiet baby, otherwise it is not a wise choice

I love the idea of this product. Like many of the other reviewer's I don't have the regular traditional style crib. Our crib converts to a toddler bed. This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs. I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one's that are more with the current styles of cribs, like mine's.

This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days

I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work.

These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.

There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height.  We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.

It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces.  What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child

This product was terrible.  First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats!  Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt.  The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it.  The stroller is a piece of junk.  When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match.  Do not buy

I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing, because of the shower and spa feature. But the shower is so hard to use, it's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time. You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling, beacause it's just not positiioned right, it sits too high up, and she just looks uncomfortable on it. You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit. It wasn't worth $40, the sling, and the spa and shower unit isn't useful or helpfula t all

When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great.  It had everything.  

Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came.  I am so glad that I did.  The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.  

The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling.  It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub.  In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else.

We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money

In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless. 

1) The "spa" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby

2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.

3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.

All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same

I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold. 
I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.
It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub

I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn.  I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse.  Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it.  Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick.  My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath.  The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it.  I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out.  Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated.  Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40.  So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-

This is my first amazon review b/c I feel this is such junk I had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed.  Usually I can find something to do with a junky product, but this is so junky I can't do anything with it, I might as well have just washed the money down the drain.  The fabric is rough, too rough for a new baby, the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable.  As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it, once filled it sinks.  How can it support a baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks.  You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger, the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break.  Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later.  I have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs, seats and supports for the tub, some I disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi

I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would.  First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub.  The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it?  Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub.  I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic.  Don't waste your money.  Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief

I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all!  This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over.  It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath.  It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit

Seems like a good idea for a seat.  I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat.  But the opening is just too small.  It is not the lack of a deflector.  I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one.  This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time.  This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty.  Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy.  We are shopping for a replacement now.  I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.  We just teach him to point "it" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine

my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now.

I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:

- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.
- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).
- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.
- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over. 

The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.  

Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand

We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son.  Boy, were we wrong.  The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart.  So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again.  He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.

It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it.  Now the bad!  The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy.  Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it.  First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off.  At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing.  Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child

I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so.  I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units.  The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem.  Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.

I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them

We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food

We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby. By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom. She was hurt pretty bad. No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight. 
Please beware of how unsafe this product is. Not at all what is advertised.

My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him.
I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.  
 Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor.

I received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is. I have a large baby. He was almost 17 lbs at four months old. So his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age. He also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs. He didn't seem very happy in it. It may work better if you have a smaller baby, but the chubbier ones will    never fit for long

I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item!  When it first came out, I purchased one for my son (he was around six months old at the time).  He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back, extending his arms behind him, and straightening his legs, so I returned it.  By the time I had my second child (a girl), Bumbomania had kicked in, and these seats were EVERYWHERE.  I began to think that my son's experience was a fluke, and I purchased another one for my daughter.  Low and behold, she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY!  So I returned the second Bumbo as well, but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children "may" be able to get out of the seat.  In conclusion, although the Bumbo may work great for some - BEWARE!  If you have little Houdinis like I do, this product is simply not safe

the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new "channel" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one

i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone

I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.

I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant.  I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work!    I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in.  I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on.  I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction!  I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on.  I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me!  I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it.  A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare

I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked, my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work. I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus. My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy

My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.  My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other "baby" toys.  This toy is just not that interesting.  I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all

My daughter really LOVES this BUS.  Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it.  She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them.   
The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up.  My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm.  But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since.

I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one

I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it

This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace

This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!  The "kit" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose.  Total and complete piece of junk!!

We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but, the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close, and hard to open, specially the one that goes between the legs, it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle  that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them, and is complicated to align them to finally buckle. In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips

At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems. 
But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby.
Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway.

We started out really liking this seat.  Its colors are not horrid like most of the others, and it doesn't cry "I have a baby!!".  It just looks nice and stylish.  Also, our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat.  HOWEVER, the #1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts.  

First, you clip them together at the baby's midsection (easy).  Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom, so you can clip them (as one) into the female end of the lap belt clip.  This is easier said than done, as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them (as one) into the other part of the belt clip.  It's hard to explain properly, but really, it's not easy to do, especially if you have only one hand free.

Second, the belts get twisted.  The 2 pieces at the base of the belt, which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip, they get reversed because the belt twists.  Think of taking your seat belt in your car, and somehow twisting the belt itself, so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way.  If this has ever happened to you, you know what I mean, and it's a pain to fix.  Just like with this seat.  It seems to get screwed up effortlessly, but then to fix it takes several minutes.  

FORGET THIS THING!!  We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego, after we used a friend's when we went to visit them for a long weekend, and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did.  The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it...  Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room.  Yes, it cost us about $100 more, but it's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it's time for the standard (non-infant) car seat

I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy, they button onto the car seat and it isn't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off. The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on.

I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out.  But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don't want them to get a crook in their neck.  

I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat.

I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though

When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all

I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!

I was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere I looked, so I figured it must be awesome. Not so. It is loud, which freaked out my 8 month old, and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well. I've tried every aspirator on the market, and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital. I took that one home with me, and urge you to do the same :)

Very disappointed

This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.  We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless.  Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators.

Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.

First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.

Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.

Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!

There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can

I ordered this through Walmart.Com and received it damaged, but Walmart and/or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide.  The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib. So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box.  Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well.  Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large.  I then received the second crib and it was spotless.  The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer.  I was not impressed. 

I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib.  I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great.  I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.

I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair  (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. 

Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap.

Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher.

ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS

Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair

I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray.
2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!  

Good points:
-pop off tray
-divider that keeps them from slipping out
-cool colors

I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less

I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could

I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies. I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different. My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal. I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great! Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair.

We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week.
The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles

First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead

We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...

I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying

The walker has a few flaws.  First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head.  My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly.  The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower.

This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility

I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon

We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker.  Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work.  I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy.  I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it.  And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes.  Other than that, I really like the walker!  lol :}  I think it will be better once we get a new toy

I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops.  It does do those things but it is hard to clean.  It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of.  I used it twice and will never use it again.  I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done.  They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table.  I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did.  Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier.  You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag.

I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.  Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!
I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table

[...] to see how worthless the Graco Lovin' Hug swing is.  The baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds (the swing has a supposed 30-pound limit).  The swing is on hard floors, is brand new, as are the batteries, and still the swing barely moves at all, even on the highest level!  When I contacted the company, they told me that the swing won't go as high when a baby gets larger, but this brief movie proves that it won't "go" at all!!  Instead, I highly recommend the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Swing.  I only wish it held a larger baby so I could continue to use it!

The &quot;sticky&quot; pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.  The organizer doesn't come with any information, so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not.  This is a great idea, but it is very poorly constructed.

I got two of these as shower gifts.  I thought that they would be so handy.  WRONG!  The velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table.  The openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are VERY small.  They will only hold the travel size or the next size up.  It was made cheep. The &quot;shelves&quot; are not sturdy at all.  Save your money!

We purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units.  Don't bother.  Whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor's baby!  What's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you can't then walk into the baby's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren????  

They are getting returned right away.

You really do get what you pay for.  I got this for around $53 but I did NOT like this product at all! The bumper is very scratchy and cheaply made. The comforter is pretty cheap too. The only thing I saved was the sheet and crib skirt which really only sit in a drawer as backup

Tired of hearing your baby cry?  This is the monitor for you.  You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing.  Looks like Evenflo  was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect.  You can barely hear anything at full volume.  I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.

The monitor was terrible!  It would only pick up our baby's voice when she was screaming.  It had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference.  It is going back to the store and I am looking for something else.  I wish I would have checked ratings first!  Choose something else

We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it

My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.

I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor

I was so excited to buy this stroller. It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us!

I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups.

I've heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself.  I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link.  Not just a littler either but with every use.  My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases.  I find this odd b/c the 6mths cups don't link at all. I think these products are very hit or miss. You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great. ?

This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic "leak stopper", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak.

I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good.  Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak.  My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star.   Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.

I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles, that we would love their "magic" cups. I am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups.  It seems like the lid and cup don't seal together well enough to withstand any activity. I'm sad to have to give Avent a bad rating, but don't waste your money on these cups

Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid

I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option.  We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation.  Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell.  I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped

I agree with the first reviewer,"Cindy"--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.).  The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.  However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better

I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit.

     We have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib...and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us.  We were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us.  So now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor.
     If you live out in the middle of no where or you don't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you

I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door.  I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex.  I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it.  I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.  I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels.  Note to self:  keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!

(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???
My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!

I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long

I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made, then I got a new bag (customer service was very nice and helpful) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it (my stroller wasn't damaged), so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money, still waiting on a refund

I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper.  It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap.  I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover.  This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye.  Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60.

I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only

I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower. But after several tries, I finally returned it. This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically. Well, the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on, my baby wakes up crying!!! Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base, and the planes don't even wake her!!!! Don't buy this product

I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it

I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth

I spent a lot of time researching strollers, and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one.  Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight, but I have not been pleased with it since.  The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat.  The snack cup has never stayed in place.  Steering this stroller is impossible...we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida.  All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego

With our knobs being on the front of the stove, these covers hung down over the oven door, and either got in the way, or were popped off on a regular basis (or pulled off by our 16 month old). We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn't in use

I agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had I come to Amazon first, I would not have wasted my money.  I got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and, being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight, he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove.  So we got and installed these covers.  Within minutes he discovered them -- and became even MORE fascinated with the stove!  He immediately began spinning them around on the knobs, and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward, the cover and the knob come right off together!  Now he had a fascinating new "rattle" to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain.  Our solution?  We took the real knobs off the stove, period.  We keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook.  As for these clear covers, they're are still in the closet -- maybe I can use them to display insect specimens or something?  Useful as knob locks they are NOT

My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas.

I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface. THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around. Also a few of my knobs pull off easily. My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come, both knob and cover. Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover. They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. It probably depends on your stove

This pump is REALLY slow, and absolutely KILLS your hand. For about the same price get the Avent Isis manual pump, it is WAAAAAAY faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump, so it doesn't hurt your hand. I haven't found that it hurts my hand at all, because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often.

the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected.

There is no need for this item.  It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed.  I hated having a wall between my baby and me.  When I woke up to nurse, I had to take her out of it anyway.  Co-sleeping is intuitive, naturally safe and easy easy easy... please don't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement.

I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use.  Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.  

I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it!  I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money!  I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20!  It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND!  (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!)

DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product!

One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw:  it cant be put back into its carrying form.  Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.  

This "floppy" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car.

After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)  

Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag.

I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor, my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area; this way, I can pad him in and he's secure.  However, I find it very difficult to manage.  

I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other!  The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand!

Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out.

All of that being said, once baby is properly "installed", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles

The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller.

This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day. Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz. in 15 to 20 min. My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter. Geat pump at a great price

I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.

I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly "wobbly".  I was shocked as I figured such an "upscale" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little "envelope" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name

I absolutely agree with this review: "You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006"

We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.

My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.

The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.

The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.

Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.

I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.

If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son

After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice.  I was VERY wrong.  When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large "bag" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in.
Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the "Usage" part.. but on the back under "Cautions" it states this:  "Unplug power cord when not in use".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy! 
Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.  
For the record.. I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell.  This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info.!!!!!!  Also.. this is baby #4 so I am quite familiar with baby products.

My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings

I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers.  Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.  
But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings. 
Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM! 
My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months. 
All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without.

The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these. 

Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause

I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.
So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown."  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!

I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's "Best Pick" Yeah right! I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis. Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking! I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money

The idea for this product is great.  The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles.

The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex.  This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place.  They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.

If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect

This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.

I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product

Our 4 month old loved this toy, at first.  But we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it didn't work more than it did.  Runs through batteries much too quickly. Also, unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin. But now it is in the trash because I touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust.  Not very safe.  Very disappointed

I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon.  The size is small and convenient, but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck.  Also, the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks!  I am really disappointed, and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag.

The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction

I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the "shelves" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.

I saw this at the store, and I just had to buy it.  I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place.  The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table.  What a marvelous concept!  So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it.  It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical!  When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump.  So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead.  It was the next best thing and I really did like the device.  I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it.  So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it.  This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed.

I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic "Diaper Depot" by Prince Lionheart

Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use.

I bought the volo after reading many reviews. However, it was utter disappointment. As soon as I took out the stroller from a box, and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece. Yes, the stroller is light, and very very flimsy. I returned it right away

We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel. I think it's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo, not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down.
On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact. Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange. The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car.
We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad. This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller. The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller. I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support. On top of it, the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same. The awning offers very little sun protection. The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access. On top of that, you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller.
When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired. With limited cargo room, it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles. It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering. Further, while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car, riding escalators and getting on and off the bus, the Volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces. We encountered potholes, dirt paths, cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster. The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters. Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief. Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo.
If I had to do it over, I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels, easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat

We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents.  This cover lasted about one minute.  Seriously!  By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors, my son had opened the first one my husband had installed.  The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open.

Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there.  This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless.  It is just very poorly made from cheap materials.  I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target.  Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design.  Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money

we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good.  the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again.  sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking.

We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift.  For a few months it worked very well...easy to use.  After about 8 months it started acting strange, giving us inaccurate readings.  The final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son's temperature wasn't even over 100.  The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital.

When I purchased these drapes, I assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the Zanzibar valences, sheets, etc. Wrong! The material is striped, and is a darker, different shade of brown than the rest of the set. I love the other items in this set, but don't waste your money on these drapes--they look awful

I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board

So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn't stick to the wall. At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower, but oh no that's not it at all. Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon. But yet again, the darn thing came un-stuck. So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn't register for, investigate whether or not it's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return. Literally.

The whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub, but that is impossible since it won't stick to tile above the tub.  I hadn't even put any toys in it, and it wouldn't stick.  I returned it and found something on "One Step Ahead".

The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter.  My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her.

The suctions are pretty weak, dont stick well to the tray.  Also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up. The arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face.  When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick, as soon as my son would touch it, it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face.  They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time. I took this back the next day. I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead.  It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose, even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray.

I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.

This item is packaged horribly. If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price. Received changing hutch and tower, crib and toybox intact. Very happy. Ordered this dresser twice, both times damaged. Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks. My suggestion is to order two dressers, take the best pieces from each, and return the rest. Believe me, you will be glad you did

I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly.  The two main parts, left side board and right side board, both came in totally cracked.  When I called in to order replacements, the customer service rep knew exactly what I'm calling to re-order.  ?!?!?!  If it's a known problem, why not fix it?!  

The customer service reps are very nice, but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn't make this product very attractive.  The processing itself takes 2-3 weeks.  In my case, 3 weeks later, I found out that my 2 parts are on back-order, awaiting shipment by container from Brazil.  So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it.  I hope the dresser arrives before the baby...

I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble

Do not order this item! I ordered and returned this item FOUR times due to cracked pieces. Storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage. I refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture. What a disaster and diappointment

This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY!

I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable

I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles.

As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition.  I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies.  I bought a starter kit and several other bottles.  I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak.  I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid.  Nothing helped.  My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them.  I switched to another brand and now we are very dry

I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  "Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the "potty" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway."   I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else.

I bought this item because the FAQ on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib, including ones with solid headboards.  However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard.  Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following:

"The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it." 

When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told:

"The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire."

I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same.  Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ, however, I now am inconvenience with returning the item.   I am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product.

I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser

I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend.  However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces.  I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue.  The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks.  With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for.

I was very disappointed in the product.  The picture does not accurately represent the armoire.  The entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood, not cherry wood at all.  The pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet, in addition to the outside.  Also, pieces did come chipped, cracked and one piece was also split into two!!! I returned the item and wish I hadn't ordered in the first place

This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless

I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment!  My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked.  if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one

I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child? 

My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.

I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though

This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts.

This was a good product for a few weeks and kept my babe warm. BUT...the zipper does not work well and it broke already. I tried to repair it, but after that broke, the quilting came apart and was too much trouble to fix. I would not recommend this JJ Cole product as I had the same problem with another one we inherited

I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.

I thought these would be great specially for the $ but I was soo WRONG!! I've only washed them once, to have everything clean b/f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls!! The fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls, way to many to even remove by hand- And on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam!!!It looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand-me-down after one wash!!

This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke

I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it

Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The &quot;strings&quot; used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative

After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you

I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product!

Don't waste your money on this high chair.  By the time your infant can safely sit in it, they will have almost outgrown it.  You're just paying for the name brand, not the quality.  Stick w/ a Graco instead

Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills

Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, "unacceptable" because it's unsafe.  (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.)  Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay.  Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should.  CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling.  Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store.  Be sure to avoid model 14565

This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.  
  
 I can't GIVE this one away

I have looked EVERYWHERE and there are no probe covers to be found ANYWHERE!  Who would sell a $30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times!  This is insane.  If anyone finds them, please let me know where.  I have checked BabysRUs, USA Baby, Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, Snyder's Drugstores, every grocery store, every discount store, every drugstore I have been to in two states over the last 3 months.  This is crazy.  I recommend not getting it

I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing - so I bought a lot. They aren't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers. Hope this helps others looking for covers for this. If the first years doesn't sell probe covers for this anymore - they shouldn't let companies sell the thermometer either.

Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links.  
  
 The thermometer works well but without probe covers, it's not a good investment. You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers. If the store you're buying the thermometer at doesn't have covers there, find another product with covers available

I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better.  I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item.  I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box.  Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed.  Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future

The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :

Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer

I purchased this wipe warmer because I didn't want a warmer that heats all the wipes.  Those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless.  The top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes. Well, this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box.  It didn't even heat the whole wipe!  I am returning the warmer.  It is a complete waste of money

First, I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby's sleep better.  That I cannot deny.  Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking.  However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk.  I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters.  She could have easily suffocated!  This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had).  Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product.  I have to tell you that that is not quite the case.  Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated.  The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either.  If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it.  I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down.  As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters.

My daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time.  I even tried to put a towell to make it less steep, but it didn't work.  Worst yet, her head would slide off the edge.  I guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around

I like the concept of an elevated design.  They should make the sides breathable.  I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home.  This has been 6 weeks so far.  He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such.  Typical baby stuff.  He ends up slidding down in between the wedges.  I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up.  You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in.  He slides no matter what.  When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge.  Good Idea needs work

This product has been a disappointment. The pillow portion is good in theory only. The baby's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not! So the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right! Wouldn't recommend, good concept, bad design

My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.  It went together fine, but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT.  In fact, we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room.

Little Tykes makes this unit, but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction.  They told me just to return it and that they've never heard of this problem.

The toy box is nice, but im not happy with the product. The directions were difficult to understand and I didn't like the top being made of cloth material. My little boy already made a tear on it. I had to remove it, I was afraid my little boy would tear it

HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all

Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!

We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.  

Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. 

It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience.

We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one

My mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson. As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom, can be a very very exciting feeling.

When we recieved our dresser, we did not open it right away. Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box, to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half. 

We called stork craft and reordered the part. The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us. My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel. I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped. 

That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house. Til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel.

My suggestion- Please read every review before purchasing any items rom fSTORK CRAFT......... There furniture and customer service is not reliable. OUR BABIES DESERVE BETTER........... DON"T YOU THINK

I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail.  3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements.  They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks.  Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks.  How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces.  Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college.  We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough.  I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it.

I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble

Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it

I could go into a long explanation of how I searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself, who is a stay at home mom.  I could explain in detail about everything I did to try and get this pump to work, in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working, of how I was freaking out my supply was dwindling so I went out to buy fenugreek.....But, suffice it to say, the motor lasted me 3 months of once, twice a week useage.  It didn't completely die, which is why it took me a while to figure it out, but after paying attention, I could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when I couldn't even get a quarter ounce from one side and I was nearly engorged..!!!  

At least Medela is shipping me out a new motor, this one I hope will at least last longer.  Especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months (6 month total warranty- which to me is too little for a product that costs over $100!!)  Even though I'm staying at home and only use the pump occasionally, I wish I'd just spent the extra $150 and gotten a Pump in Style!

I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I'm engorged and found out the motor is broken.  I'm very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name.  If I could afford it, I'd replace it with the Pump-in-Style, but unfortunately, I'll have to try a manual pump

I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.

This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up.

It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money

I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target

I thought I would love this but just returned it.  It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?)  Maybe I'm too small (5'2")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large.  Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable.  I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing!  Very painful

How annoying to pay $25 more here than at Walmart. Same price at Babies R Us. Is it really the same exact thing? Very frustrating.

Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps.  I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat.  That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat.

Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward, loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat. Since this happened he's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place...just by loosening the harness.Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product. I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this.
Not very happy

I tried to put this oven "lock" on my oven. Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick.

I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place.  Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there.  Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck.  In the trash it went.

I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle.  So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4" of the adhesive strip on the oven.  Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door.  In the trash it went as well.

I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens.  :

The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail

Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants, it is not high enough and very combersome to use. Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub. HOWEVER, the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger

I inherited this product from my neightbor last week.  I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it.  I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart.  I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used.  What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily

I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price

I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son.  It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub.  It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub.  The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub.  There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub.  He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth.  There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay.  His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while.  I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured.

The image showing for this spoon set is not correct. The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old. When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant

Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it

I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week.  One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams.  So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it.  I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams.  So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand.  To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine.  I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective.  Good luck if you decide to order this

This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortabl

I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy

I was very disppointed in this product. I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer, but this was the only good quality. I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching. You could smell the plastic in the milk. I'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals, especially when her liver isn't developed enough to fully detoxify them.
I really wanted to love this product, but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option

I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles

I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.  

One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately.  Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get.  Another waste of money from Avent.

I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.

They are messy when they opened. I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much. I don't have much room in my freezer. when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate... it's like $17 for ten :-

I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.

I am returning my Roxy safe seat!  It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door....The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat.  At a grocery store, the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries.  Its not worth the hastle.  I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.  The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place.  Sorry GRACO, the idea was good but the carseat is awfull

Graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over $100 for something that appears to be made with less than $20 worth of materials. The seat is MUCH too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 Nissan Sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer, but much more inconvenient. 

The documentation, in my opinion is very poor, and I've installed Linux systems from scratch w/ less documentation... Bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don't completely understand the instructions.

Let's not talk about the styling... wasn't black, red and gray popular in the 80's or did I miss the come back somewhere...

I hope I can find something better... I'm giving this product TWO stars because it will do the job... but I expect much more from a product

This mirror really isn't worth the money.  You'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby, that's about all this thing does.  The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror, kinda hard to do driving down the road.  Also, the music isn't very loud, atleast not loud enough to get baby's attention when upset, which is what I was hoping for.  And the lights aren't very bright.  Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out.  Also, the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards, but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat, it doesn't stay in place that well.  You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror

I was very disappointed in this mirror.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all. 

I registered for this because of the remote control feature. Well, the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit "on" (remote control access mode) in order for it to work.  There's a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music. You cannot control that feature from the remote control. You also cannot control the volume from the remote. It's really a pain.  I'm keeping it because I like the mirror but I'm not happy with it.  Save your money and buy the SafeFit Baby In Sight mirror.

I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!

With the rear-facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan, this mirror limits driver visability.  When the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror, a large section of the back windshield is blocked.  I'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror

I don't even know where to begin. Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids. (1 1/2 and 6 months old) Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him, she would cover her face and cry! He would go off all by himself, which was really creepy in the middle of the night. And he broke after a couple of months. Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house. He's defantly not worth the mone

Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!

I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit

Bought these for my Nikon D200 about 3 months ago. Never having used Tiffen before I took a chance on a recommendation. Vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse I've seen. Build quality of all the filters is really not very good. Going to go back to Hoya's which are much better

I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.  
The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign.
The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.
The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason

I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-

I paid extra for Air Next Day service.  Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  Item eventually arrived two weeks later.  I had left for a trip.  Item was eventually sent back to merchant.  Merchant didn't credit me for item returned.  I had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited.  I won't buy from Willoughby's again

When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. 
After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. 
The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!
They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera.

I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:

-I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!
-The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.

Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30.

Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.
 
Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.

PROS: 
Can be used for film or digital cameras 
Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting 

CONS: 
Bulky and heavy
Not neutral color balance

As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)

The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months

I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.

I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.

I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.

When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.

I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  

Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords

I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.

Beware of  assuming that  the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct  size.  It wasn't even close.  No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it

This kit is just junk. The &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges

I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.

For nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5X) magnification.  It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I sent this product back.

The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s.
Just setting the D200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the SB800/Masster & SB600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.

The SB800 is designed for this purpose. So why not include information on how to do this?

I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one

I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...
Save money and buy 5XX series flash..

At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.

Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens

This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.

I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    

In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon.

This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.

I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.

Later, I decided on the Tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  The salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when I told him I had this Canon lens.  He said, "let me guess, you'd like to try the Tamron 17-50/2.8."  He said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. I could return it with no questions asked if I wasn't satisfied.  He also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  

My first images with this lens were great.  They were SHARP and had way more vibrant color.  There is absolutely no comparison at all.  I was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon.  I was so dissapointed that I wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  After spending $$$ on a digital SLR, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  Before taking a chance on buying the Canon, do yourself a BIG favor and try the Canon and Tamron at a local store.

I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.  

Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.

Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.

If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.

That's why I give this one 2 stars

I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?

It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.
Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. 

This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.

Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.

Do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera

I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. My much cheaper, and lower resolution, old Minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. I find I have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. In addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.

Don't buy this camera

This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive

To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200.

Amazon's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it. I will never buy from Amazon again. I bought over 100 items over 5 years. I purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan. They then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer's needs. I cancelled order 2 days before it ships, they say sorry we cannot cancel. 2 days??? come-on. I guess the $3000 just creates nice interest.
The end for me and amazon, I do not like this kind of "aggressive marketing".

Good advice, Rather buy direct from B&H Photo, pay double if you like, but you will get what you pay for there, not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms.
I am truly annoyed. Run, hide.

I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses:
Canon 10-22mm
Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version)
Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it. 

The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too. 

You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens.

"You get what you pay for"

Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.

I was hoping the same of this product from all the "glowing" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.

Here are it's bad points:

-The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.

-The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.

-The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.

In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod

Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months

I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. 

-Positives-
fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.

The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.

that's about it.

-Negatives-
The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.

The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.

Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.

It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).


I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak

Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! 

With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.

WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!

I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. 

If you need a "cable release," I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time.

I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazo

You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.

During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.

On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.

Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality

Like another reviewer's, my experience has been mixed. I use this remote with the D50. 

Sometimes the remote works, then it goes on strike. Then suddenly it works again. Same distance and angle from the camera. 

I changed the battery - same result. I hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable

I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen.

The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware!
Canon, here I come!

I had my Sony DSC W70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit. The glass itself was intact, but something underneath was clearly broken. Mailed it in to the factory service company for Sony, and I was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair. This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially. 

I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera.

The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it

Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for

I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.

The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good

It takes around 3-4 seconds to take the picture after I click the button!!
And then another 8-10 seconds just to store that picture on the SD card!!

So basically, I cant take another picture until atleast 10-15 seconds of one picture!!

Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:
 * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.
 * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.
 * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.
 * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.

Casio has decided I'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.

Don't be seduced! It's a poor quality product

Just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier Casio models. Presently in Iraq, I do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. Sad. It looked to be a great camera

I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.

The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the "film" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens.

They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro.

As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.

Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens?

The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.

After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).

I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. 

Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. 


Cons:

In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.

Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).

The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. 

Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.

The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. 

After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.

Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.

So would I recommend this camera:
If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere

Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all

When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!

Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon

I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.

Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting

They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.

I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about

After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant.

Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight

I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me

After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.

This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight!

Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again

For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good

A520 Lens problem

I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake

This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.

After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this.

I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away

I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital.  The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  The delay between pictures is incredibly long.  The lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems

These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain:

Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the LCD screen. I shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so I'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) I always show the subjects their photos after I take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. For further clarification, I'm Asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities.

I run around a lot when I shoot. So the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. I got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where I was, but the second time, I wasn't so lucky. So what did I do? I purchased another one. Not only did I have to purchase the extender, I had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. Another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. I didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, I upgraded to the 30D.

If you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. However, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my Canon Backpack. For some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera.

Another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day.

I guess I'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30D; I'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10D

OK, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the LCD screen as much.  The MOST annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  Both my 30D and Rebel XT.  If I am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually I will not be reminded I wasted money on this accesory

I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.

Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless

Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.

The frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my PC.  My major complaint is the power supply.  The original power supply dies after 4 months.  It was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  The raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  I then had to buy one.  That one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  After months of waiting from them to stock the item I gave up and after lots of searching on the web I found a supply made by another compay.  I had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  It's been doing fine since then.  I should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  It looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  I would do a lot of shopping before buying this one

It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards

I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls

Gosh, i would really like to review this adapter, but---

Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more. 
But wait! What's that blurb on the product page -"Availability: Ususally ships within 24 hours" and "Want it delivered Tomorrow? Order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout. See details."

So they can't deliver it, yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow? Don't order from Amazon

I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'

I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.

That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.

What else can I say about this camera:

This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.

It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.

I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.

When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?

I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.

There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star

I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??

I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again

Hello All,

Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one

Wow... Now if you really want to see a rip-off, here it is. Not to be damaging to Amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun. The hood is definitely not worth it

It's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood.  How can you pay $75 for a great prime lens, and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it

The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.

A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP

This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.

The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.

I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon

Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.

Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.  

Dumped mine a month after I got it

While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version

Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.
 
Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.

PROS: 
Can be used for film or digital cameras 
Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting 

CONS: 
Bulky and heavy
Not neutral color balance

I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.

For nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5X) magnification.  It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I sent this product back.

The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s.
Just setting the D200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the SB800/Masster & SB600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.

The SB800 is designed for this purpose. So why not include information on how to do this?

I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...
Save money and buy 5XX series flash..

At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.

Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens

This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.

I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    

In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon.

This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.

I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.

Later, I decided on the Tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  The salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when I told him I had this Canon lens.  He said, "let me guess, you'd like to try the Tamron 17-50/2.8."  He said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. I could return it with no questions asked if I wasn't satisfied.  He also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  

My first images with this lens were great.  They were SHARP and had way more vibrant color.  There is absolutely no comparison at all.  I was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon.  I was so dissapointed that I wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  After spending $$$ on a digital SLR, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  Before taking a chance on buying the Canon, do yourself a BIG favor and try the Canon and Tamron at a local store.

I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.  

Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.

Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.

If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.

That's why I give this one 2 stars

I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:

-I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!
-The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.

Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30.

This kit is just junk. The &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges

I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?

It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.
Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. 

This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.

Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.

Do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera

I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. My much cheaper, and lower resolution, old Minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. I find I have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. In addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.

Don't buy this camera

This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive

To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200.

I purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a NASCAR Nextel Cup Championship in Homestead, FL. I was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning. The lens is not very sharp, feels very cheap, and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light. 

I packed up and returned the lens about an hour after I got off the plane. I am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture. 

I suggest you do the same.

I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses:
Canon 10-22mm
Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version)
Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it. 

The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too. 

You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens.

"You get what you pay for"

Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.

I was hoping the same of this product from all the "glowing" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.

Here are it's bad points:

-The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.

-The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.

-The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.

In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod

Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months

I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. 

-Positives-
fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.

The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.

that's about it.

-Negatives-
The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.

The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.

Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.

It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).


I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak

Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! 

With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.

WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!

I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. 

If you need a "cable release," I strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. It gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time.

I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazo

You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.

During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.

On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.

Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality

I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.  
The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign.
The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.
The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason

The filters that I got are poorly finished.  The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens.  All filters come off EASILY.  They are totally useless.  I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens

I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-

Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds. 

There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price. 

If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. 

There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. 

Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings. 

Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter. 

Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters. 

PROS: 
Can be used for film or digital cameras 
Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting 

CONS: 
Bulky and heavy 
Not neutral color balance

I got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens. The solution might be useful, the blower is useful, the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips, but the so called "magic cloth" is anything but magic. It kept leaving lint on my lens

Someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size.  Well, that person isn't alone.  The camera I purchased is a Canon S2is, which I love.  The lense doesn't fit it.  I even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it STILL doesn't fit.  This simply is NOT the right lense for a Canon S2is, no matter what Amazon suggests.  Now, too much time has passed for me to return the lense.  I'm stuck with it, and I don't like that

I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.  
I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you.

The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware!
Canon, here I come!

I had my Sony DSC W70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit. The glass itself was intact, but something underneath was clearly broken. Mailed it in to the factory service company for Sony, and I was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair. This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially. 

I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera.

Don't buy this camera really.  I had it for a month and was taking good care of it.  I was initially thrilled.  The LCD screen got damaged -- no I didn't drop it.  The treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that I was shocked. The customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if I were an idiot.  A $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible.  It was a great camera at first, but I demand better treatment and respect from the company.  Look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera.  I had read very negative things about Sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true.  I don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when I am the customer.  The camera is a month old and it is now garbage.  While I understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, I will not accept such poor treatment and customer service.  I teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera.

The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it

Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for

I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.

The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good

Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!

I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit

From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530.  Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to "zoom in" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on.   To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.  
I'm disappointed because I do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly. 
Fortunately, I bought it at Costco, so it's going back.

Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  Sure enough:
 * The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.
 * Sometimes it refuses to start at all.
 * It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.
 * Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether.  This is after 8 months.

Casio has decided I'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.

Don't be seduced! It's a poor quality product

PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS CAMERA'S SHOCK SENSITIVITY

I was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the SECOND time. It's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. The result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. It didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly.

The first time it happened Casio repaired it under warranty. The second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. I won't reinvest in a weak product. I'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether

I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.

The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the "film" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens.

They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro.

As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.

Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens?

The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.

After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).

I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. 

Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. 


Cons:

In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.

Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).

The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. 

Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.

The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. 

After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.

Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.

So would I recommend this camera:
If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere

Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all

I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.

When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!

Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon

I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality.

Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting

They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.

As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)

The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months

I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.

I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.

I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.

When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.

I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  

Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords

I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.

I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about

After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant.

Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight

I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me

Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to "Memory Error" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.

This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon.  Guess I won't be buying another canon.

Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems.

For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good

I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.

After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this.

I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away

I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital.  The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  The delay between pictures is incredibly long.  The lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems

OK, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the LCD screen as much.  The MOST annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  Both my 30D and Rebel XT.  If I am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually I will not be reminded I wasted money on this accesory

I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.

Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless

Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.

The frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  Sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my PC.  My major complaint is the power supply.  The original power supply dies after 4 months.  It was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  The raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  I then had to buy one.  That one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  After months of waiting from them to stock the item I gave up and after lots of searching on the web I found a supply made by another compay.  I had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  It's been doing fine since then.  I should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  It looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  I would do a lot of shopping before buying this one

A great idea poorly executed.  The construction is cheap.  The screen is marginal at best.  But worst of all, it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras I have on hand or a USB card reader.

I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit

The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off.  Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.)  This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand

It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards

I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls

Gosh, i would really like to review this adapter, but---

Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more. 
But wait! What's that blurb on the product page -"Availability: Ususally ships within 24 hours" and "Want it delivered Tomorrow? Order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout. See details."

So they can't deliver it, yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow? Don't order from Amazon

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.

I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.

I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'

I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.

That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.

What else can I say about this camera:

This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.

It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.

I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.

When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?

I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.

There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star

I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??

I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again

I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera.
After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate.
I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers.

Item was eventually sent back to merchant.  Merchant didn't credit me for item returned.  I had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited.  I won't buy from Willoughby's again

I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash

When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. 
After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. 
The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!
They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera.

The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.

A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP

This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.

The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.

I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon

Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.

Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.  

Dumped mine a month after I got it

While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version

I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography. It has been nothing but a headache from day one. We have yet to be able to download any pictures. All of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them. The one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in English seem to be in a foreign language.  The directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties. You are suppose to call the phone #, but good luck getting through. I've tried for 2 days straight. They apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this "Educational camera".  As I am shopping for another camera, I will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera-  Sakar

This camera is garbage. It was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money. It was hard to figure out, it took lousy pictures, it burned through batteries. Avoid this camera. I just wish I could give it zero stars

I purchased this for my 4 year old son because he LOVES to take pictures.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use.  Not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working.  However, when it did work every single picture was blurry.  There is only one button for every option and it is very confusing.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It is being returned

This camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work.  It's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures.  When you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible.  We trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing

We bought three of these for Christmas presents and two of them stopped working already.  They won't turn on at all.  One of them broke almost immediately, and Philips sent a refurbished unit to replace it.  That one is now broken, too.  The units have not been dropped or mistreated in any way.

Well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. The video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. Also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. The adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. The sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to "freeze up".

Bottom line...I recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. Its trash. Go for something else

Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!

I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP

I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.

I only wish I had read the previous review before I bought this item.  I too was trying to convert my Hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my Sony MiniDV handycam.  I bought this way-too-expensive cable, mostly because it was the only option available.  It seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card, considering the technology involved in those devices.

But my real problem is with the failure of Sony to reveal that the S-video connection is useless for input.  This information is nowhere on the package, nor is it on their website.  There IS a notice saying "please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase".  You can't read that warning when buying online, and if buying at a store, there's no way to know what's compatible because they don't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package. I guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website, then come back to the store and buy it, instead of just buying it and seeing if it works.

There is a section of the Handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one, however they fail to mention that the SONY cable won't work, despite the premium price they charge.  If the problem is that they couldn't make it work with both a composite and S-video cable, then they should have just made it work for S-video, since a composite cable comes with the camera.

Shame on you, Sony, for adding a little aggravation to my day, and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard.  It's enough to make me want to buy a Canon camcorder (I buy Canon digital cameras precisely because I don't want to submit to proprietary Sony standards like MemoryStick).

Rant over.

Conclusions:

To start from the end I got the Xacti CA6, tested it and returned it. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros - 
1. Very small, just put in your pocket and go
2. Easy and simple controls
3. Super fast start up from sleep mode
4. Good video quality when lighting conditions are good
5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (I had no issue with the video pausing, no way around that)
6. You get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price
7. SD card that records for a long time
8. Easy transfer to computer for editing 

Cons - 

1. Indoor video unacceptable, although the video is brighter the ones my Sony digicam takes, it is extremely grainy (more so than my Sony digicam videos!!)
2. Super slow zoom when in video mode
3. In good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move, for scenery it might be OK)
4. In low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very, very weak flash.
5. Red eye almost every time the flash works
6. Strap is a joke
7. No lens cover

So in short, on paper this camera is great, I love having the SD format rather than tape or DVD, the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless. 
But....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical).
This camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). For almost everyone else it is not adequate, I will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a miniDV camcorder  (going for the Elura 100).....
Ya, I know people told me that this was the best option beforehand, I was hoping to prove them wrong....; - (

In an email, Adorama specified that the filter diameter was, "28mm." On the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting! Either they don't know their products or they don't care about the customers. Now I have to return it because of faulty information they supplied. Please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25% of the purchase price - an amount I feel is beyond absurd. I can buy this locally for a lot less (even though I would have to pay sales tax). Buyer beware

My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.  I am done with this camera

It worked fine the first week. Then the focus stopped working. I sent it to repair. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working. I sent it for repair for the second time. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working. Also, it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at SONY!!! They make you wait over an hour!!!
Si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for!!!

After a few months use the camera got persnickety, often demanding upon startup that I restart it. Now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, I think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. Another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. Not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.

The lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. Several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. Otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.

The camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., Canon A610. Many frames are motion-blurred, as well. There are ways to avoid this, but I didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.

There are a few things to recommend it: Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. Those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. It is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) The jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. Skintones are good.

Still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. Lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, I did keep the receipt. Anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo

I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it

I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities. 

In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after "erasing" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera. 

I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons. Good luck Fujifulm...you need it

I was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once I did.  The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) likes like a massive blur.  And the video skips all the time.  It just misses entire parts.  I would highly recommend NOT getting this camera.

Kodak tiene una linea de Camaras econ�micas las cuales paracen ser desechables.

I just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  But today I tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).  Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.  

Grrrrr!!

I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.

I purchased this item two weeks ago.  My thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced, perfect addition to the "tools" necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents, construction, and "glow-in-the-dark" planisphere).  After closely examining the item for the past ten days, I'm forced to conclude that I was in error, and that you really do get what you pay for.  As Celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy, I must confess that I assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name.  I have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps.  The major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings, letter transpositions, apparent omitted words, and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) "typographical errors."  Additionally, when I compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e., star magnitudes, astronomical distances, etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources I have in my possession, I also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances.  When using a product like this, it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains.  Since I'm not able to do this, I must rate this item with one star.  When I purchased the item, it was marked down by twenty percent.  I note that in less that two weeks since my purchase, the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent.  In this case, don't be fooled (as I was) by an attractive price.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT. (I don't have a substitute to recommend at this time.)

With this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully!  In standard mode, the playback of video is anything but smooth.  Looks like an old time movie.  

The software could best be described as, "User Hostile".  I haven't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete.

The normal video isn't as good as my DV camcorders and downright sad indoors.  The photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone (a pocket pc).  Still pictures haven't downloaded successfully either (approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer).

It's a handy size and easy to operate.  After you're done recording you'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual (I have) and then you start getting frustrated.

If I could return it, I would

I am fascinated with this machine.   It has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows.

The battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when I go touring.   If I take care to shut the display down as soon as I dont need it anymore I find that when I am on a cruise ship or visiting another country I can take all the movies I usually want - - and recharge when I get back to my room at night. 

The only problem is playback on a TV or PC.   The bundled software made by ULEAD is not user friendly and, whereas the previous Xacti I had played back images and video clips in the order I had taken, this one separates  them and plays back either clips or images.   Before I played back through my Panasonic Hard Disk DVD recorder and recorded a DVD directly.   Now I have to go into my PC and do a whole lot of editing and so far the "Movie FActory" program keeps crashing.

I imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program, or I will learn to use Ulead, but for the time being the pictures and clips Ihave taken have very good detail, and the machine has operated flawlessly.

Great features, right?
I just returned it after very disappointing results.
Here are just a few issues:
1. If you use a tripod (and you WILL need to), you can't plug in the AC adapter to save on the short battery life, because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the AC connection.
2. Battery life is very short.
3. If you want to protect the lens, you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens.
4. You can't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter BECAUSE the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures.
5. The automatic settings are horrible. The auto focus, auto white balance, auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors.
6. You cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording.
7. Quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light.

Save your money. Buy a camera with better features. I am waiting for the Panasonic HDC-SD1 due in March

I have been working with this camera for about a year now, for product shots online, and while sometimes it takes great pics, many times the flash pops and whites out, or it goes off and you get a black picture. I take pictures of jewelry, and if I try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration, the color is not accurate. Purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up. While you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings, in all different modes, you'll never get the same picture twice, even saving the setting. The light has to be just so, to get a good shot. When it shoots clearly, it can take fabulous pictures, but often, pics are blurred as many others have said, when they actually come out. My old camera, the DSC P71 3.2 Megapixel is MUCH better, colors are accurate always, shooting is flawless and foolproof every time, AND the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading. This feature is completely MISSING from the DSC P200, which was the biggest disappointment, as I figured it would be a given I didn't have to ask about when purchasing. Why would Sony eliminate this great function? Had I know that when the salesman at the large New York City Photo store told me this was the camera I dreamed of, I would not have bought it. I prefer also to use the rechargable AA batteries instead of the Lithium battery, which is super hard to load, and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with. It is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle. Every time it takes me several minutes, and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem. 
I recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to DVD. Sound quality is good, but video quality can be choppy, and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed, so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings I made. The monitor, while big, does not show you always what you are shooting, whether a still, or movie picture. Overall, I would not recommend this camera and I actually bought a USED second of my old camera, and got my original repaired, because this one doesn't compare. This camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly. Even after using all this time, I STILL am not sure what I am going to get when I use this camera. I'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color, this camera clearly has trouble showing blue/green shades, and purples accurately, you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera, and the lack of the "trimming" resizing feature, what was Sony thinking? Next time, I am trying something other than Sony Cybershot unless I hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward, uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera. This one is definitely NOT

I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because... I may have used the wrong settings when taking photo's. 
But... I ended up with "a lot" of blurred and fuzzy photo's. "example... when we went bowling, almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks."
My Biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use.
You might expect that out of a $30 Dollar Camera but "NOT" a $3 Hundred Dollar one.
I paid $284.99 for the camera, $47.99 for the 1 GB SD Memory Card and $51.54 for the Docking Station and that didn't include S&H or Taxes, they were extra $$$!
My husband replaced this one for me with the Kodak EasyShare C743 and G600 printer dock and it's a 7.1 MP and it takes better quality pictures that I can print @ home for less then this one. ($249.95 W/FREE Shipping & Handling and 1 GB SD Memory Card included) from K O D A K online

This Canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out, on a 1080p monitor.  I have used other HDV format cameras, and they were much better. The low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain.  If you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light, but still plauged in low light

I bought this camera in Oct 2005. I brought it everywhere. Loved it. In April 2006, the LCD screen blew. Canon replaced it with a refurbished camera. In March 2007, the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00, as they have determined this is the result of impact damage. How they determine this is unclear to me, as it was not dropped or impacted...Apparently, you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera. That, to me, is the hallmark of a faulty product. Unfortunate - as I really loved this camera

I bought the sd300 to take with me touring by motorcycle. It is so small, I can just put it in a belt case and always have it. With the appropriate sd card I can take a huge number of pictures at a high quality setting. The pictures turn out great, BUT. Eight months after I bought it, the LCD screen suddenly went all crazed when turned on, tho there was no visible damage. I returned it for repair, no problem, no expense, had it back in two weeks. less than 3 months later, same thing. I know I did not drop or bump it, it went down in the 10 minutes between showing some pictures to one person, then to another, indoors. I called, was told it was still 
under warranty from the previous repair, and got a return label. Then I got an e-mail saying that I would have to pay $97 for repairs to the lcd screen caused by impact damage. I replied to the e-mail to protest, and was ignored. I finaly called, and was told that tho the warranty was still in force, this damage was not covered. Checking aroun the web, I found that this is a common problem, not damage. Unfortunately, I had already authorized the repair when I found this out, so I guess I am stuck. I have several canon products, will not buy any more

I had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke, I don't know why it broke. I set it down and when I turned it back on, it had cracked. I then bought another LCD screen and repaired it myself, but two weeks later, I had a CASE for it, and put it in my purse. I carried my purse around and had not set my purse down. When I took it out, it had cracked again. I would not recommend getting this camera

HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!

I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.

so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like "um... is THAT it???" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... 

also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all... 

other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.

I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said "THANK YOU!" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.  

The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious.

The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon.

The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one.

Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera

I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera

Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside.  The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever

I bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable.  The problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. During this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it.  Because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use.  I own Nikon 35mm SLR cameras and I am shocked that Nikon would sell this unusable product.  If it is your life your recording, I recommend that you buy a different camera

Unless you take picture outside, no matter what you do, the picture comes out blurry.
Flash doesn't help at all- it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture, and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors. 
My sister had a camera from Olympus, with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too, but I found it so much easier to take a picture(and a better one too) with that one. 
Unless you want to buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera, you shouldn't consider nikon 5600.

I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera.

I made sure I did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.

I was highly disappointed when I got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately  the lens got stuck in the "out" position with an error reading that said:  lens error, restart camera.  I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing.  I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.  

I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.  Please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later

I bought htis from Amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see "System error" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know.

Video is okay for my need...still is too bad. 
Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons.

Battery did not perform as promised in the spec. 

Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit.

I have to say I am very disappointed with this camera.  I had really high hopes for this one.  I waited for the hd2 to come out and when I saw a lot of positive reviews I bought one, I should have waited.  For Sanyo to call this an HD camera doesn't make sense.  The picture has more grain and noise then my old High 8 camera.  Outdoors in bright light the camera is ok. Low-light is horrible 

Pros:
- Nice form factor, love the look and feel and it's so tiny it fits in your pocket.  Very portable and something you can take anywhere. 
- Secure Digital cards are great, can transfer and edit on the computer quickly
- Still pictures are pretty good.  Although still digital cameras are better.
- HDMI output can plug directly into your HDTV (although if you are used to watching things in HD you will be disappointed)

Cons:
- Indoor and Low light situations very grainy, even with the high sensitivity button.
- Don't attempt to take still shots while you are filming, it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues.  Very cheesy.
- You can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying.  I thought SD was supposed to minimize noise.  
- Watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy, not even fast movement either.
- Image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras I have used.
- Audio sounds a bit tinny 

In my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you.  If you aren't too concerned with quality picture it's probably fine. I really think Sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device.  For now it should come with a warning of it's limitations.  I am not saying it's total garbage, but if you have high hopes like I did, you will be disappointed.

As I watch the videos of my kids on my 50" plasma, 32" LCD and Mac, trying to convince myself that I like the quality, my wife walks by and says, "Fuzzy." I know most guys out there will know what I'm talking about - she just killed the deal. Regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. It's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old Sony DVR. The product design is cool, the price is good, the SD card recording idea is perfect, but the HD promise doesn't come close to paying off.

If you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle.

I got mine today, and it is being returned today.  I had high hopes, given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity.  I was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video.  Here's my results:

1) Stills.  Pictures are not too bad, but do not compare with a similar 7MP Canon SD500 which I own.  The zoom works well, focusing is ok, but slow.  The pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them, flash or not, like they are all taken at a high ISO setting on a regular digital cam.  So slight disappointment here.

2) Video.  If this is improved low light sensitivity, I would not have liked to see the results on the HD1!  Video does not even come close to comparing to my regular Sony DV camera.  Focusing is hit or miss, and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my Sony.

I really was hoping for the be all end all combo device, but the HD2 does neither very well.  Ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well.  The finish is great and the buttons are well placed.  But it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves

Ok, I was hasty in this purchase.  At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered.  You see, the dimensions listed under "more details" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  Turns out, not only do you have to click "more details," (fine print) you also have to click "more technical details." (finer print)  Wish I had now.  Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2.  So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed

I purchased this along with a Sony DCRHC21.  This Carry case was listed as an accesory so I expected it to be appropriately sized (as other Sony cases I've purchased fit like a glove).  This  case is entirely too large to hold a miniDV camcorder.  The camcorder rattles around inside it.  If you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  Otherwise I suggest you look at the Product Specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size.

The look and feel of this camcorder is very good. Unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. For example, evening party, indoor school activities, kid drama and orchestra. This camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. Earlier I had a Sony DCR TRV140, which was way better than this camcorder.

This camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. One easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. Most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. These large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light.

If you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light, I do not recommend it.

After a week of using this I find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing.  Mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect, so maybe the motor was already fixed :-)  My mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender.  The ZR 500 is OK in low light, but you CAN adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. You can also adjust the focus too!

My friend who is a mini DV guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par.  

I've made two practice DVD's (with firewire, no problem at all) with this camera and like what I see.  

For those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out.  Power Director has that feature.

I am happy with this product, but I would rather have a higher end model now that I have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder.
A great camcorder for beginners!

I have owned the S410 camera for almost two years, when on New Years Eve I pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the E18 error message appeared! It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! Beware of this flaw that Canon doesn't seem to acknowledge

Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.  

However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.

When I got this camera for my birthday April 2005 I thought that it was a dream come true. The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did. 
The camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. It is not worth the price of repair. Tomorrow I am going to buy a new camera.

this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it. 

the good

*it is compact, which is pretty convenient

*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy. 

the bad

*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over. 

*the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.

*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.

*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry. 

*the user manual left me with a lot of questions

Not impressed at all with this product.  You are better off just to plug in your camera in the USB port and let Windows process it.  At least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved.  I suggest you don't use Easyshare software.  Windows Pic and Fax Viewer is far superior to this software.  If you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use Easyshare.  The solution to this is to uninstall Easyshare and all pics with revert to Windows

I purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera.  When I was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house, there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo.  When I took a photo outside, there was no shadow.  I went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said I would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room, but he said, in reality, 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments'.  I did experiment with the light balance, but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.The flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks.  I returned the product.

Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

Don't waste your time and dollars.......................

Probably a very good case, but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment, a strap and a velcro.  The shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap.  For the Olympus Stylus digital cameras, look to the Lowepro case - better case and value

The product advertisement is misleading or incomplete (no picture of the actual contents).  The following quote is from Fuji Mall:

"AC Adapter: Charge your batteries at home or around the world with the travel adapters."

What it fails to mention is that the charger is an external charger only, and you cannot power the camera or charge batteries while in the camera. I was looking for an AC Adapter that I can power the Camera (and charge it's batteries inside the camera).

The NiMH cells are not the 2500 ma/hr rating that comes with the E900 camera (they are 2000 ma/hr, but this was noted in the product specifications).

I teach a photography class and needed an AC Adapter to power each camera used during the class while demonstrating.  This product does not meet this criteria.  It can however charge up to 4-AA Batteries at a time, and includes an Auto Adapter which is handy.

Case is Bulky, not small enough to tote an E900 conveniently when not bringing the charger equipment

I will keep this review simple.

For the price this is an ok deal.

However:
The bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop.
The battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality
Batteries are generic rechargeables.

You are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. It will wind up costing you less in the long run

If you can actually get the picture to turn out right, it does take pretty decent pictures.  Most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy.  It also only holds about 5 pictures, so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot.  I was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars, and it doesn't really seem worth it

I purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera. It's either not enough, or it's too much ... I'm not sure which. I returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel Powershot A640 which has a swiveling view finder (which is great!) and will suit my needs just fine for about $200 less.

I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.

It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.

Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month.

The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too

When I was buying my husbands Olympus Camera this Rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so I ordered it.  Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time.  No it was not!!!  So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!!

NOT A HAPPY AMAZON SHOPPER!

i bought this toy a year ago and tried it on my ETX-90EC telescope all i got  is hazy moon video,the resolution is poor 
the maximum pixels is 640*420 which is very pooooooor resolution it didnt reach even 1 mega pixels , hey we've got now 12 MegaPixels chips why dont provide it celstron ???
tried to edit it with the included poor software but it was useless
i thought it might need bigger telescope so the aperture would be higher and  i might able to see some stars or galaxies as per advertisement
i went to my cousin who has LX90 8" telescope, the result was bright dots seem to be stars
i dont recommend this toy its a waste of money
if you want really to take serious photograph try to attach your film or digital camera to your telescope by T-Adapte

My title says it all - I was really disappointed with this camera, but before I get into the specifics as to why, I must mention a few things first.  This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, "it's okay, it happens", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called "grey market" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the "grey market" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the "authorized" product, and the "grey market" one.  For example, a "grey" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an "Auction" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short "how to" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with "grey market" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to "explore" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit "warm".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of "pink" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a "broken" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with "stair stepping" - the movies were "jerky", and "noisy".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly "fixed" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just "cripple" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather "improved" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it.

I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun.

However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  Good luck

I can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was DOA.  Customer Service was unable to do anything over the phone.  Since it was purchased as a gift and I had time before Christmas, I opted for a different brand.  Doesn't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box

I was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. I was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. The resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (IIIx), just enlarged.

I sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. I believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better

they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill. The batteries charged lasted atleast five hours, so no complaints there, but the charger would keep coming out from the wall. It only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it wouldn't stay all the way in, I tried several outlets, finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all

I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.  

If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit

I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't.  The reason is because it was dead on arrival.  I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.  Steer clear of this piece of junk

My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.

I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see

"lens error, restart camera" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. When I searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. I have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. I dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)

I have been searching reviews of the Nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and I am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with Nikon only to be told 'sorry'.

In a nutshell, I am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new SLR models.  I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES. 

The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is.  Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures

The wifi is a great idea!  The idea on paper sounds amazing, but the way you had to do it was horrible.  it gave you no control over what pictures or anything.  plus it was slow.

The Picture quality was HORRILBE!!!  M y two Megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera.  They look AMAZING on the LCD screen, but once you get them on the computer, they are fuzzy, grainy, etc.

I would not recomend this camera to anybody.  yes, it has some nice features, but the pictures are anything but acceptable

The camera feels slick.  The software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency, though the intuitiveness is not its strength.  While the large LCD display is terrific (the main reason I got it), It is worthless in a high glare situation.  You can't see what you are shooting.  It's worthless!  And since Nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations, there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting.
While the viewing wheel, to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken, is quite handy, the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive, and often takes so long to figure out that you give up.  Pictures are generally good, though the conditions have to be perfect, or you get grain or blur.

There is one lovely feature, but it is only useful on a tri-pod.  It is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background.  It creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix.  I use that feature a lot, but its worthless without "legs" for the camera.

I bought this on a whim, counting on the Nikon reputation.  Had I known, I would have stuck with the Canon

I lost the weights the second day of use. Bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body. Save your money on this one.

I really don't know how to write a "helpful" review for this camera, I'm not a photographer; all I can say is that I was NOT satisfied with my purchase, so...

***
If you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like I was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras.
***

Here are my complaints:

Flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.

Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.

The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.
Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).

The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.

Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!

Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier. The video mode is great as well.

If you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then I must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time

I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.  This camera is going back to amazon in the morning

VERY slow storage even with a fast card....small but too thick for comfortable handling. I ended up selling it on ebay and buying a Canon SD600 which is a great camera, thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket, fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time. I've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures. Don't buy the Nikon without first checking out the Canon SD600.

I agree with the people complaining about the poor CS policy at JVC. They let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. 
I am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid JVC in the future. I just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. This will come back and bite them in the behind

This camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  When we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - Nebraska).  This worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  I wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable

I agree with the many other users who have experienced the "Condensation, Operation Paused" defect on their JVC GR-xxxx. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.

I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying "Cheese". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally.
It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made

I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon.  When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had "liquid" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is "impossible" for that kind of "accident" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) "I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault." Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation.

this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.

what i liked about it:
1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use
2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice
3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've used

what i disliked about it:
1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest
2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.
3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)

this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events

I have had both the S5000 and the S5100 I was disapointed when my S5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but I was happy with the picture quality. I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. I am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable.

I had an S5000 but it dropped it and broke. So I decided to buy this model since I loved the S5000 so much. They took away so many of the great options and quality that the S5000 had...so now I just use a small Fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. It is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. I would suggest going with the S5000 even with lower Megapixels it is much better quality

This frame looks great until you turn it on. The picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. When you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. What does that mean you ask? That means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. You will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; This will not take advantage of the entire frame. If you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. I have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. See below.

The build quality of the frame is pretty good. If Mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen, this would be a nice little frame.

A little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio, but I figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image, making it look distorted. These steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. I set up a macro in Photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. You will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. Some of your images might be better served one at a time.
 
Start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program.
 
1. Go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels)
 
This will make the image look distorted. That is ok.
 
2. Then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels)
            
The image is ready to save. You might want to save as in to another folder so you
can go back to your original if needed.
 
3. Copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame

I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it.  The display, contrast and brightness were great. 

However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.  

Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons.

I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  Two of them stopped working.  One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  Unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  And inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.

I'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!!

Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off

I purchased this for my 10 yr old son. I was surprised at how, well, cheap it appeared. We took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first, then it worked for about 10 minutes, then it never worked again and we had to return it. Amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly. We ended up buying the DGX 5.1 MP from a local store i it's place. It has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth. Not a professional photography instrument, but a pretty decent unit for him

I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain

We have had this camera for about a year.  We wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  The picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. We have a Canon Powershot A60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  I would not recommend this Polaroid camera to anyone

this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 GB memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't

Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.

I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! 
She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.
Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!

I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars.  I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit.  The set I received did not have the extention straps included.  The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back.  If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars.  They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture

This item was offered as a suggested accessory to the Nikon Monarch ATB 8X42 Waterproof Binoculars that I purchased.  I later also purchased the 12X42 Binoculars.  This harness CAN NOT be attached to either pair of binoculars!  The hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.

Other than that the harness is a well made quality product

Not to mention the battery sucks.It lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.This camera should be $99.00.TRUST ME PEOPLE......IF I COULD RATE THIS THING AT A ZERO I WOULD.IT IS NOT WORTH IT.HOWEVER,a camera i absolutely love is the Sony Cybershot DSCT5.An awesome little camera

It's not an item to write home about.  Final picture quality is usually OK but not spectacular.  The wi-fi works some days, mostly not.  If I'd known then what I know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser.

I've owned this camera a little over a year. It was my 2nd digital camera. It always had focus issues in low-light. I thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after I finally had some time, I discovered that it was the camera. You really need a tripod for those low-light shots. I wasn't able to return it, so I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. It takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen. However, the lens will no longer contract and I get an error message that is unresolvable unless I pay at least $170. I'm just going to get a better quality camera. I will not buy Sony again

This tripod seemed to be very nice...  Until we tried to extend the legs all of the way.  Two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended.  The locking devices are pretty poor.  They are made of a cheap plastic and I believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use.  Next time I will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock

It's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 PC's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. One of my PCs runs XP (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the Magpix) and the others run Win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the Magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). They gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition I wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. I suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product

I purchased the WP-DC700 underwater case for my A70 and followed the directions exactly, oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use. It leaked and ruined my month old camera. Customer service was rude, blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested. The underwater case has a 7 DAY WARANTY and the camera is not covered for water damage. My father had a similar problem with his $1000 Nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. So beware of bad customer service. Canon's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the Better business Burea

Very disappointed in this product and Amazon's response to the problem.

Item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until I complained that it was not included,  this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed.
They have told me they can't supply the missing part  (the metal neck strap showing in the photo) as item comes from a freight forwarder.    I did not get what I paid for and unable to return  because item has been forward shipped out of the country

The Adorama Silica Gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. I emailed customer service at Adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond. I can't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready. What color should it be and what color should indicate recharging. How to I recharge it? Nothing tells me how to recharge it. So far, money wasted. Unresponsive to my emails

I read all the reviews and comments on this Kodak printer I could find. Many gave glowing reviews. I'd just purchased a new Kodak digital camera, and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup. 

I was never able to get the printer to perform as Kodak says it should. It caused some odd conflict, and my computer would not boot into Windows XP with the printer attached to the computer. I ended up having to disconnect the printer, turn on my computer, and then reconnect the printer in order to use it. Windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers. It was made even more frustrating by Kodak's tech support. I called and emailed multiple times for assistance. In one conversation I was literally told "I don't know what's wrong and can't help you." Now that's tech support!

Finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper. I tried all Kodak's remedies, none worked. No matter how much or how little paper was in the machine, it said there was no paper. I even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print.

I can't recommend this printer. I could give a better recommendation had Kodak itself, through its tech support, at least have provided my with some competent assistance. I got about 2 dozen prints, quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all.

About the only positive I can give is that the prints I did get looked good, the color was nice. I gave it an extra star for print quality alone.

Kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time. It was synonymous with home photography once upon a time. They've lost something over the years, and that is quality

I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.

It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.

Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. 

I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.

When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.

Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.

I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.

If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.

I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics.

Do NOT buy the Fuji digital camera. They charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period. Their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears. Rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee.

The title says it all: one month the warranty expired, the zoom feature on the camera broke, making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on.  The camera is all but useless.  The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10.

The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck

I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!

In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate

I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =

I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera

There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!

I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.

This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??

This is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures.  And it takes wonderful video. The downloading is easy and in general it's a "fine" camera.  However....

the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare.  It's constantly over exposing every subject.  I find it practically un-usable.  The only way I can get the image I'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the ISO to 800.  If it had a 1600 ISO I wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that.  

The other thing I don't like that I didn't realize I wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries.  The batteries have to be removed and charged seperately.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it.  The batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice.  Intensely dissatisfying.  

This camera also has a REALLY LONG DELAY from pushing the button to taking the picture.  This results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces.  I know that most digitals have a delay but this one is EPIC.  

I am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a Canon.  I am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my Canon 5D.  But since this was rated Camera of the Year by American Photo (a publication I trust implicitly), I decided to stray from my Canon.  bad idea.  I'm going right to a PowerShot.  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.  I reccommend you do the same.

This camera/Mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true! I brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies. But I was sadly mistaken... This camera just takes cheap pictures and videos. The only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that I had no need for. After about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better I gave up and sold it on eBay for the same price as I brought it for. It's a great idea... but it just isn't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice. The Mp3 player isn't all that wonderful either. It doesn't work with iTunes. Or easy work with Windows. Hope this helps... I wish I would have read this before I brought this camera

I no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder, so I finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until I could get back on my feet to get another good one. I thought this one may do, good price, looks sharp, purchased on impulse . . .big NO-NO.

I will say the camera takes decent pictures (as the previous reviews state, almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with
very good lighting). Other than that, don't bother. The MP3 is a cute
function (and quite possibly the most practical). The video, UHH, let's
not even go there. The voice recorder, also not bad - records in WAV format and can be transferred to PC. 

Jack of all trades, master of none . . .I guess that would be the best
way to finally describe this item. I will say that I'll be saving up now
for much better camcorder and no more "I just gotta have this right now"
Save your $, find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it. Trust me, it will be overall better in the long run . .

I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day. 
I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money.
I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option

I was extremely disappointed with this product; I felt very let down by Sony, because for years I bought Sony items with confidence, knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable.  This item only goes to prove that Sony's standards have dropped and, as such I will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs.
What lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up; 2 metres (not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping) was the best I could do, and that was in a straight line.  No, all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin

I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a "clone" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know

Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

Don't waste your time and dollars.......................

My hunting buddy purchased a Nikon 800. My intent was to put him in the shade. That Nikon kicks the crap out of my Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000. Tried new batteries, tried bluffing, even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards.
My opinion is this product is not worth the postage.
Anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product. [...

I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product

These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair.

Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price

I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products

I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera. 

The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.

I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft.

We bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all "EuroCam" for an upcoming trip to Europe. It promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip.
 
Sadly, the camera is not up to filling this role. We will need to take another camera along with it. However, we will take the V705 for its wide-angle lens, the reason that we picked this model in the first place. It is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review.

The need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. If you do not need a 23mm lens, or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens, then you do not need this otherwise mediocre P&S (Point and Shoot) camera. 

Good: Fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; The 23mm is the default lens; Rapid start-up time; Internal focus and zoom; Chromatic aberration well controlled; Can use 4GB cards; Freeze-frame and extract any video frame.

Mediocre: Soft images; Perceptible shutter lag; Slow shot-to-shot times; Exposure compensation is easy, but steps are too small for digital, and is reset when camera turned off; Flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; Image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; Flimsy construction; No manual controls; No RAW format; No optical viewfinder; Histogram on display, but too small to be useful.

Bad: The Absolute Worst menu system to be found on a camera; Excessive and unadjustable JPEG compression; Poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; Unacceptable visual noise starting at ASA-400; Forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images, with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; Panoramic component images forced to 5MP; Overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); MPEG-4 video compression gives very poor results.

Synopsis:

If you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot, this, and the older V570, are the only choices.

If most of your images are in bright light, the 7MP V705 gives better images. If most images will be in low light, the older, cheaper, 5MP V570 is the better choice.
 
The camera seems very fragile. Treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. If you chose this as your sole camera, you will likely be unhappy with your choice.

The ONLY reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens. 

= = = = =  Some Expanded Comments  = = = = =

Twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. This lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. On power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens, which is ideal for us. However, considering that this is truly a specialty lens, it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. Best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. Better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens.

The camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. This works fairly well, at the cost of even more image softness, but even-so, barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. This in-camera correction can be turned off. Doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance.

However, being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. The only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as:  manual settings, a physically larger sensor chip, RAW image files, or, at least, a choice of degree of JPEG compression.

At the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. There are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom', so, as with all digicams, the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. After reaching optical zoom limits, one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program.

Kodak's advertised "5X Optical Zoom" is, at best, misleading. Actually, it is just flat out untrue. The camera has two lenses. The only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens, which is not quite 3:1. The wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (Note, in some places Kodak claims 39-114, in others 39-117 optical zoom.)
 
Also misleading is the claimed "Anti-blur technology." As best I can tell from looking at the images, and at the EXIF metadata, all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the ASA. Certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera.

Speaking of ASA. This is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. It is Byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. To adduce, `Auto' ASA ranges from 50-200, to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. To change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! On either of the other two P&Ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. The menu system is next to unusable in the field.

Still on ASA settings, the camera does have sensitivities up to ASA/ISO 1000 (though the manual only documents ASAs up to 800, 1000 is available on the camera). Unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime, will never-happen-again moment, then 200 is the max ASA tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. At 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5".

The previous version of this camera, V570, had only 5MP, but the same sensor size. By increasing the pixel count, but not the physical size of the sensor, the new V705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. This has happened with many of the current P&S cameras, as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality.  My initial experience with low-light high ASA use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 MP, as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact.

Another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which, when calibrated to the sensor in the camera, allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. Doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10" prints at ASA 800. If one really wants to get carried away, combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at ASA 1000 doable. People willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit Kodak's target market.

Back to earth.

The V705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7MP P&S cameras. Mostly I believe this is because of the overly aggressive JPEG compression, which is not adjustable (e.g. `best', `good', etc). My guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. This results in small files, with a lot of compression artifact. The 7MP JPEGs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5MB in size, those from another 7MP P&S I have are 5-6MB. My 6MP prosumer digital SLR JPEGs are 8-10MB. The more the compression, the worse the image. Most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. Kodak picks it for you, and picks poorly.

The V705's video performance is very disappointing. It uses MPEG-4 compression, and at very aggressive compression settings. Unless it is a video of your baby's first steps, or aliens landing in the backyard, you will likely find it hard to watch. The total output datastream is about 0.5 MBS. Compare this with a miniDV tape video datastream of 25 MBS (total, adding sound, error correction, and time codes, is 36 MBS). Better to have stuck with MPEG-2 which would give less compression, but decent enough (TV quality) videos. That is the choice that most manufactures have made. As a result, the videos from my other P&Ss have about a 2 MBS datastream, and so are of much better quality.

The battery. Kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. I am getting 100-120, with minimal use of flash and the LCD on `energy saver'. Even 150 would be poor, compared with my other digital P&Ss, where I expect at least 200, and often get 250+ if I am at all careful with power-management. This camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mAh battery. My (several) other, P&Ss have 790-1120 mAh batteries, and, I suspect, more efficient processors.

Since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle, the battery will likely last most of a day. We have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera.

Though the body is of aluminum, the camera itself is overall fragile and I doubt will hold up more than a year or two. The battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. The media door often dislodges open.

Truly, my belief is that Kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) "EasyShare" dock system. This would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory, and the overly aggressive JPEG compression.

Shutter lag, the b�te noire of digital cameras, is very evident with this model. I do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter, and the image being recorded. However, based on over 50 years of tripping shutters, it clearly varies, and I estimate is, at best 1/4  second, up to a bit over 1/2 second. In addition to the shutter lag, there is a perceptible lag in the LCD viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. Together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment, an active child at a particular instant, or a wary animal almost impossible. The shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price P&S cameras from other makers.

The accompanying `manual' is poorly organized, childishly written. "Finish reading this book, so you can take and share your best pictures!"  At best, it was written for 8 year olds.

The manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual', however the address given is incorrect. When eventually found, the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level.

Panoramics, one of the advertising points of the camera, are another disappointment. Basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode', each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image, in order to allow alignment. As with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. So far, this is all OK; however, it rapidly goes downhill.

First, the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) MP. Next, the image overlay is so dark that, even with the LCD set at max brightness, it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements.

However, it gets worse.

The images MUST be joined in-camera! The individual images cannot be stored! In-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. Aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2" LCD in the field gives, in spite of the camera's best efforts, much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger, and higher quality, computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home.

The best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment, and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7MP single-stills, making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. Of course, my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera, so we will not be dragging it along. You can eyeball the needed EC close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. Much better if the V705 allowed the individual images to be saved.

Reading back through this review, I see that it is mostly negative. This makes sense, for, as I disclosed at the beginning, it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. Likely I have said all that needs to be said.

So I will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens.  Except for this unique lens, the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced P&S cameras currently on the market.

If you need a true wide-angle P&S, you need this camera. Otherwise forget it

I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!

I ordered a case for my Kodak DX6490 digital camera from ANTONLINE thru AMAZON but received a case that is inches too small for my camera.  If the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  In spite of this ANTOLINE has refused to issue an RMA for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if I return without their RMA. They tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  The only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  Is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? I guess I could go to the airport and put it through the screener.

There is a little tag on the case that reads DX6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height, depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice. When I checked Kodak online, the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions.

Amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either. At this point I would never patronize ANTOLINE again

This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part.  It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping.  I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  For only $12.  Next time, I'll be smarter!

Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly "white" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase

I too, loved the camera, despite the small LCD screen size, until it got the infamous White Screen of Death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs AFTER the warranty expires (1 year).  Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80).  Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.  

White screen of death temporary solution:  Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the "Cybershot" logo on the front of the camera.  Then turn it back on.  Repeat if necessary.  It'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop

Like others, mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in I turn it on in still mode. Bought in December 2005, it is now not working.  It is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and Sony is not addressing it. Sony should be forced to recall these cameras.

The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.  Because the camera was shipped in November 2005, Sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111.  Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future

I loved my 4.1mp Sony Cypershot I got for Christmas in 2005. Then a few days after Christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it. If I would tap the camera they would go away. But then a few days later I was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working. It would turn on but then shut off. I had this problem before with low batteries but I changed them and it still didn't work. It would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. So many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. SO SAD CAMERA DEA

Ok, this camera was inexpensive so I bought it for my kid for Christmas (2005).  It actually took better pictures than my other camera (other model Sony Cyber-Shot), so I didn't give it to my kid, I kept it.  I bought it a few weeks before Christmas, it was opened and used on Christmas day. I just used it days ago, and it just did the thing where it starts turning on, then immediately shuts off.  It has been less than 1 year of use, but a week over 1 year from purchase.  Sony wants to charge me $111 and change, to fix it (The camera was less than that when I bought it).  I was just using the camera and it just shut off!  I searched inet to find MANY other people experience same issue.  THIS CAMERA IS DISPOSABLE!!!!  I took my extra 256mb chip out of it to put in my other Sony camera, and my wife said you can't see the screen (lcd screen) and you couldn't for a long time.  The other camera has the same issue MANY other people complain of as well.  I also have 2 different model Sony DVD writers for computer which are malfunctioning, and a Sony Vega 36" TV which isn't worth the money. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SONY PRODUCT AGAIN!

As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000. 

At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.)  If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000

I purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. When I saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, I was embarassed that I had given such an inferior item as a gift.  Perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels.

I would not recommend this item at all

It's only redeemingly quality is the price (if you get a good deal). Photo quality is poor, and screen is quite small (3x5). Navigation is not overly complicated, but buttons must be pushed hard to work. It did work perfectly fine - took SD card, even connected to my Mac and drag and drop photos onto the SD card I inserted into the frame. But, because of the poor quality of the photos, I don't suggest buying

i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???

I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill.
Based upon our experiences (among other bad experiences with Best Buy), we stopped shopping at Best Buy, and now own a lovely Olympus camera.  Don't buy the Sony Cybershot DSC-T9

Just bought a SONY T9 in Tokyo last April 10,2006 (7 months ago).
And suddenly 2 weeks ago, the screen went dim practically can not see anything.

The power on / off also not working. All happened at the same time.
Try to repair at SONY service station in Shanghai as I am residing there for the moment.

Very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair, despite that I do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the Tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes.

The SONY people there are really not helpful at all.

Most probably we suspect, they don't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from SONY worldwide.
It is shameful for such a big name like SONY.

Definitely, I will not buy again from SONY. Change to Olympus for the replacement and also cancel my BRAVIA LCD purchase.

I do not recommend buying goods from SONY as you  might have the same experiences (poor hardware quality and services)

I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it. 

Unfortunately, that evening I had trouble docking our new Sony camcorder, and when I looked at the bottom of the camcorder, I saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! To my great relief, I was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. I was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not "consumer error." (I can't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then I can't dock the camcorder... bad on Sony there...but still.) 

Your mileage may vary, but this tripod is going back to Amazon, and I'll be shopping for another brand.

I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.     

One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a "real" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization "person".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony

These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair.

Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars.  One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA.  I am returning this product

But the case has two large flaps on the sides which make it difficult to put the camera in and out.

Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible. 

It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, "case" would be stretching the definition somewhat

Cheaply made and ill-fitting, this "deluxe" case isn't worth half the price.  There is no handle or wrist strap provided; your camera's strap becomes the carry handle.  A small, snap-strap is provided, but I can't figure out what it's for... the snap is easily unfastened with light pressure, and I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of the empty case, much less with the heft of a camera inside.  Don't buy this item:  Amazon will not reimburse you for the return postage, because it's not their fault you don't like it... and you WILL be returning it.  Save yourself the trouble.

The default supplier for this item is Adorama.  They have sku numbers mixed up on the back end, so they will ship you the HP 6221 dock instead.  Will not work with the R series.
They do not even carry the actual HP 8887 dock.  
Huge hassles, so click on the new and used link and buy directly from Amazon.  It's a few dollars more, but at least you get the right item

I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug).

HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation.

I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it

This dock does NOT fit the R817 Camera.  Just bought this and the HP R817 and I am very disappointed.  The input for the camera is to big for the 817.  So do not buy this if you get the 817 **update** This review was written, when the dock was stated to fit the R817, which has been changed because it does not fit

This is first Canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. They must acquire them from their Chinese supplier for about 98 cents. This plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. I bought it to use with the Canon 250D close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. Canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks.

Even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly. Price may be less buy its not worth for long run. I feel Sony and Canon are better than JVC. Even Hitachi is good

I purchased this camera from Amazon recently.  The FIRST time around, the camera tape door wouldn't shut the very first time I opened it.  I returned the camera and Amazon was great about replcing it promptly.  The SECOND time around, the DV port worked once, and ONLY once.  There's a short in it.  There is a REASON this camera is so cheap.  It's J U N K!!  I will add that a friend of mine is on her second JVC as well.  A fact I did not know until all of this came about.  

For two stars, I'll say the video quality is good.  The camera battery does hold a full 60 min. charge.  I had NO sound issues what so ever.  Background noise?? none here.
As for still pictures, if you don't know what you're doing as far as shutter speeds, back light, etc. FORGET IT.  The still pictures are very grainy.  If you want professional looking stills, do NOT buy a camcorder for this purpose.

JVC tech support is USELESS.

Camcorder comes with a USB wire to upload still only.  As on ANY digital camcorders, you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port.  You need a firewire.  This does not come with one.  Also, you need to check if you HAVE a firewire port on your computer.

I paid app. $25 dollars here on Amazon including shipping, for a port and firewire.  It took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower.  It's no big deal.

Amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time, only refund my money.  This camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when I bought it last month.  

Overall, AMAZON was great about service and return, however, this particular JVC item is JUNK

Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem. 

Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair

It's unfortunate that with a name like Canon, you expect a quality camera.  That's why you shell out the money for an item that you think Canon will stand behind.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.

I bought this camera to use in graduate school (industrial design).  I needed it to do research for my thesis.  I figured between that, all the product photographs, and the need good portfolio pieces, spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment.  I was wrong.

About a month after I bought the camera, it started to malfunction.  The lens got stuck and would not come out.  Neither would it go all the way back in, so the lens cover would not close (not only putting the lens in danger, but draining the battery as well.)  It was still under warranty, so I sent it to the Canon Service Center in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.  It was received, and I was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days.  That was almost a month and a half ago.

I have put my thesis research on hold because I do not have the proper camera for it.  Every time I call the service center, I am told that the "parts are on back order".  Evidently they don't know when these shipments are due in their center, so they don't know when I will have my camera back.  The best part is, when I called two weeks ago, they offered me a "brand new" S215.  The told me it was a great deal and that I should accept the offer because "they NEVER do THAT" (meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair.)  I pointed out that the S215 was only 5mp, had a smaller screen, and cost nearly 300.00 less than MY camera.  I also reminded her that MY camera was brand new when it broke and I had to send it in.

Today I was told that there was no information on my camera, the backordered parts, or when they could send my camera back.  The woman on the phone asked me why I didn't accept the S215 that was offered, and when I explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine, she said they were not authorized to do that.  I told her that I was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and Canon Corporate Headquarters, and she suddenly had a technician she could consult, and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week.  I won't hold my breath, but a copy of this review will be sent to Canon.

This S80 used to be the only WIDE ANGLE compact point and shoot digital camera on the market. It has now been discontinued I'm told. But, we're in luck! There are THREE other digital point and shoot cameras with a real 28mm WIDE ANGLE lens! These are: 1) The Panasonic DMC-FX01 for $250, and the 2) Canon Powershot SD800 IS for $400. and, 3) The Kodak EasyShare V570 for about $350.


So, you ask, "who needs a 28mm lens?" You do! Most people concern themselves with how LONG is their telephoto lens. But, most people who "know" know that it is the WIDE ANGLE lens that is most important---most of the "best shots" are made with a WIDE ANGLE lens. For example, you're in Europe and you are trying to "get a shot" of that Cathedral of Notre Dame over there. You NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the California Poppy Fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the garden of the California Mission and you want to take a photo of the ENTIRE garden surrounded by the mission walls---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. It's Christmas day and you want a photo of the ENTIRE GROUP of visitors in front of the Christmas Tree---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. This is where the 28mm lens on THIS camera comes in! So, you NEED THIS CAMERA! Otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving Aunt Sylvia out of the "Christmas Group Photo" this year---and she'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) If you agree or disagree or know of ANY other digital point and shoot camera that has a WIDE ANGLE lens please write, Email:boland7214@aol. 

Here's one more wide angle candidate: Kodak EasyShare V705 7.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Ultra-Wide-Angle Dual-Lens Optical Zoom

I received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, I ran into an error message: "Unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery."  I did what I was told.  Several times.  Same message.  Argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, I read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  I searched the web looking for a solution, but all I found were perhaps hundreds of people with the SAME message on similar JVC model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from JVC once their warranty ran out.  Luckily I ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product.

Sure, you might not believe me when I suggest to stay clear of this model.  I'm constantly disregarding Amazon reviews that preach "do not buy this product!", etc.  That's why I'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.  Suggested search on Google: "jvc camcorder safeguard mode error".

Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  Watch for more details.  Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price

I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  We had to send the unit back.  I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item.

This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from.

The first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of "600x." Do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x, the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. 

The finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate, and this is not even that big.  Finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration.  the 1 1/4" size of the eyepiece is creditable, but too high a mignification for this scope.  And the field of view is in doubt, and don't even think of using the barlow.  Buy this scope, and after a few outings, it will most likely sit in the attic.  The review immediately before mine is correct. This is no way to get started in astronomy.

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope. Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys. 

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.

Too Small, Poor Mount, Useless for Astronomy

This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  

3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon.

Have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid.  Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and  error.  After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance.  Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames.  Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist.

The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price

Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)

Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories

I owned this Sony for a single day before I returned it to Amazon.  First off, it records in MPEG2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer.  It is also not natively supported on the Mac without a 20$ additional Quicktime MPEG2 plugin.  Which has to be converted before editing. Which makes it a slow, tedious affair.  Also, the included software is, surprise, PC only.  
  Other problems, not computer related - the Chroma shift in "night mode" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly.  I'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(Sony).  The auto white balance could also use the same attention.

  Like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a PC.  The LCD touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use.  All in all, I would go for a Canon

I bought this camera in about February 2005 but didn't know enought about digital to know what I can actually get.  Goes through batteries pretty fast.  The recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot.  Takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture.  I just thought this was normal for digital cameras till I began reading later reviews.  Then I accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on.  Contacted HP to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one.  So I am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a Canon or Sony or something besides an HP

I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera

We bought one of these in the spring of '05. We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the "reconditioned" camera.  It has been OK since then. 
 HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to.
 This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot.
 All in all, disappointing. I will never buy another HP camera

Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share.

My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.

Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.

And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.

I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months

I have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now, so as someone with alot of experience with it, I advise you NOT TO BUY ONE.  I wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks...

- Without buying a memory card, this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above VGA.
- Non HP memory cards are incompatible.
- It EATS UP batteries, seriously.
- It shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever.
- It will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable.

At this point, I am shopping for a new camera because my M407 claims that brand new batteries are "depleted" and shuts off, lovely

THIS CAMERA IS THE WORST!!!I BOUGHT THIS ON BLACK FRIDAY THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I AM RETURNING THIS PIECE OF JUNK:
1.FIRST OF ALL, IT RUNS ON DOUBLE A BATTERIES

2.WHEN I CAME HOME I STARTED TAKING PICTURES.AFTER I TOOK MY FIRST PICTURE, IT SAID ERROR SAVING IMAGE!

3.THEN IT WORKED AND IT DIDNT WORK.I TRIED DOWNLOADING SOME OF THE PICTURES THAT WERE ACTUALLY SAVED ON THE CAMERA ONTO  THE COMPUTER.WHEN I FINISHED DOWNLOADING THEM, I LOOKED FOR THE PICS ON THE COMPUTER.I F0UND THEM BUT THE PICS WERE ALL BLURRY.I WAS SO FED UP THAT I LEFT IT SITTING ON MY COMPUTER DESK FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,IT WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME!I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HP MADE GOOD CAMERAS.....-_-

I ordered the Sony DCR-DVD108 on April 9.  I still haven't received the camera.  What I have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why.  As far as I'm concerned it is too late!  The first stated that the shipment would leave on April 16.  When I purchase the camera, I did so because the add stated that if I wanted the camera by April 12, I needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes.  This I did.  The next e-mail that arrived just this morning and I've been informed that it will arrive between April 26 and May 3.   I have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates, I'll be missing 2 more.  Well, I'm not missing 2 more and Amazon is getting the camera back. The best part of this is that I don't even have the option of canceling the order because Amazon is and I quote, "... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed."  If you can't get the order out on time, you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet, try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost.  I can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life.

bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page, so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality.  but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one.  in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on, and in good lighting it is barely adequate.  wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card...should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer.  you get what you pay for

I only had it for a few hours and after that I knew I would be returning it. Its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. I should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. But honestly, I prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. It's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. You basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. This also is a pain for Mac users. It says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in ASF format. Now you can play it in VLC, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. It converts just fine, except without audio. I've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. So, Mac users, pick something else. It is being returned, for certain

I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire.  He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.  I ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working.
I thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, I don't think I would recommend this Aiptek model to anyone

Hi, I bought this camera and installed the driver from both the CD and then the web.  It caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times.  The camera worked without interfacing with the computer, but, then, what's the point?  Also, the pictures and movies were VERY grainy and low quality.  The tech support when I had these problems was HORRIBLE.  They really didn't stand behind the product AT ALL and to me that's the most important thing!  Maybe I could have gotten it to work, but not without SOME input from Aiptek.  
I've never written one of these reviews before, but this really got to me.  Don't buy this camera is my advice.

I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:

1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..

2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.

3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.

As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices.

It seems as if every time I want to use the camera, the battery is dead. I find that if I charge it and try to use it the next day, I should expect very much. I'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes, but I shouldn't have to do so

This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again

I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.

Thought I'd died and gone to heaven; this lens was everything I wanted and more.  Three weeks after receiving it we went to the Grand Canyon, and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance, clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus.  It's not my D70, which still works wth other lenses.  This one's going back to it's maker!  If they fix it, I'll revise this review

Not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly, it is a complete downgrade. Panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the PV GS320 model,a MICROPHONE JACK! I currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time, since the 300 is discontinued I purchased the so called upgraded model. Now the only available model with MIC jack is the VDR 310, and I have heard DVD is quality on Camcorders is not what it should be. If you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a MIC, this camera is not for you

I've purchased seven items from Amazon in 2005, so I'm not a complete rookie. This item's ad title includes the word "Battery" in big, bold letters . I purchased this kit advertised with a "Used Price", but "Condition: New". The ad picture clearly shows a battery. I had looked at several ads and did not read the individual Seller's comment "BATTERY MISSING" in uppercase, though in regular font. To me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a "comment". That's my "lesson learned", but I still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. LESSON LEARNED: READ THE WHOLE AD FOR THE SPECIFIC SELLER, ESPECIALLY THE "Seller's comments"

This product link needs to be corrected, as the battery contained in the kit is NOT the same battery which is used in the DCR-DVD7.  Do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the DCR-DVD7 camera.

The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping

This camera looks cool. But it's so, so not cool.

The people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. This is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. EVER.

By the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. It "clips" on... but not for long. The camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. It's complelety unreadable. Even with a 150mb card I could only take a few short quality videos. You can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. And I'm talkin' LOW quality. Worse than any video you've seen online.

More problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. The controls and interface are not intuitive. You'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. Oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are HUUUUGE. They aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. I had the camera in my pocket and when I stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. They're obviously intended for Oompa-Loompas.

I'm sure I could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason.

Don't waste your time with this. You will be sorely disappointed. In fact, if I could give this product a rating of-10 stars I would do so. I'm so extremely disappointed with this camera

I paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. The menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. A bummer of a christmas present

Received the DXG-506V yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. Many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. This is kind of like false advertising. This is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. Geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple � inch plastic mount on the bottom. As for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. You can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. That is pretty bad. The resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.

The best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in AVI, MOV or ASX format at different resolutions which is why I got it in the first place. It is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. It also has a lens cap. 

My advice to DXG is this. 
1.	Add a tripod mount.
2.	Move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that I can use an external microphone. That would be sweet.
3.	Improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. The optional settings do nothing to improve this. I tried them all.

Bottom line is that I would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. There are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use.

They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge. 

While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek.

This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS

For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.

Not recommended

I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved.  We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned.  If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  What a pain!  Also, the picture quality is horrible.  I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak

This is the worst camera I have ever owned in my life. I had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one! I have taken this camera on 2 vacations now, and both times I brought along my Olympus SLR film camera, and both times, the Olympus pictures are clearer, brighter and all but maybe 1 will work, with this stupid Sony Cybershot, I end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening, the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time, or in bright lighting. On the first vacation I went on with this camera, my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures, as did my Olympus, on the second vacation I returned from today as I write this, I just downloaded my pictures, and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad, the ones that came off my film camera are perfect! My sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her, and as I went through her pictures, same thing over 2/3's of them didn't work, I would have just assumed I'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my Sony that did not work, however hers didn't either, I would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem, however, I took a number of the exact same picture on this Sony as well as my Olympus (as a back up and thank god I did) and the pictures from the Olympus, as well as every other camera I have ever used, have come out fantastic, on this camera though, they come out horrible, so bad in fact that I'm embarrassed to show people! Believe me, if I hadn't gotten it free as a present I'd be writing a nasty letter to Sony, as it is though my next camera I'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment, therefore knows what they're doing. Sony makes great TV's and home entertainment systems, anything else I've bought from them, or known someone who has, has been junk, their camera, their car stereos, their computers! Sony should stick to TV's and Home Theater, it's what they're good at, camera's not so much, unless you're looking for something cheap that you'd only use in the day, even then I'd recommend a disposable, they even work better than this camera

we had this camera for about a year until on Thanksgiving Day while out of town it broke.  The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  I am looking into now buying the Canon powershot 6.

I have owned several digital cameras, and this is my current digital camera in hands. I would write a short review as a critical person with concentration ONLY on important things to watch for.
Pros
- Uses only 2 AA batteries.
- Battery life is very good.
- Small camera size. Easily fits into a pocket.
- Can set '+' flash level, which forces camera to make a stronger flash. I use it almost every time.
Cons
- Resolution. The images are not sharp in terms of that you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture. I would say, there is no much difference in quality between 4 MP and 50% (1 MP) scaled down version. The same problem exists in Sony DSC W1 camera.
- I had many problems with "ON" button. Sometimes camera refuses to turn on. It can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again. (It could be a defect in my camera only).
- Some camera parts are painted plastic, which can be scratched.
- Camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries (~several hours) or without them at all (10 minutes).
- Video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode, but eats flash space very quickly. Windows 2000 didn't have the right codec to view the file. I had to install it by myself.
- Camera is performing slightly below the average in low lighting condition with auto settings

Bought the Samsung 363 from Amazon and it developed mechanical fault while I was test running. Making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable.
About 2 weeks later, i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again. Problem with the power system. paralysing it completely (all in less than 3 wks from purchase. Left it Plugged to charge for 2 days without difference

It's indeed a sad story. That would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder.

I bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the PC.  It worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the LCD or the viewfinder.  I could see other information on the LCD, such as the date, time, menu, but no image from the screen.  I called Samsung and that is where it is now for repairs.  A check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented.  I did try to install the software that came with the camera, but that did not go to well either.  I will retry when I get a working camera again.

The thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. Even those taken with a tripod. I am a pro photographer, and I would not recommend this camera. Yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...Seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images

I bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing.
THe video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace...
Its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min

We bought this camera two years ago.  We have loved using it, until last week.  The camera showed an "E18" error in the middle of a special event.  We researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  We're not sure how ours developed the E18 (never dropped or damaged.) Our camera has been rendered useless and Canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair

Please buy a different camera.  I have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras.  Under normal wear and tear, the Cannon SD400's LCD screen broke where other cameras I've owned have not.  I just purchased the Nikon S7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that I can hit it with no adverse affect.  If you do buy the SD400, set aside the $150 you'll likely need to replace the LCD

I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera

I bought this camera to mainly use the Digital macro mode, it worked great for several months, now it will not lock focus, this camera is very frustrating, every picture that I take I have to edit to lighten the picture, I tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out, to no avail, I am a commercial real estate appraiser, so I have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera, and just about every one I had to lighten, now the Macro mode wont work, I will not buy another cannon product ever again!!

I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused. 

Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.

Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me

Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.  The camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code E18.  I've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  Nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  Canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer!

Here's one more A95 to add to the ever increasing list of E18 failures.
Thanks to the horror stories from the other posters I'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. The camera is only about 2 years old... guess I'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits!
The camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. Hope you have better luck than me if you get one

I got the dreaded "E18" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake

I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.  

And then... 
There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.  

I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON.

I've had this camera just over a year (figures) and it has gone completely bonkers on me.  Sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless.  You never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable.  Keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business, so it wasn't abused, dropped, thrown in the bottom of a purse, etc.  It was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total.

Frankly, I'm kind of glad it broke so that I have an excuse to replace it.  Here's why:

1.  Takes beautiful still shots, but forget about any kind of action.  It takes too long between shots to get good action.  It also blurs nearly all the action shots I've ever taken, regardless of what mode it's in.

2.  The red-eye is aweful.  It should do better.

I doubt that I'll ever buy another Canon

This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.

I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.  It kept saying that the lens cap was on.  I am so frustrated and sad.  I spent a good chunk of money on this item and don't know what happened... still don't have a way of recording my daughter's milestones.... 

Don't buy it, if you have other options.

In the replacement kit also battery was missing. Returned both the items.

I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.

It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.

Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. 

I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.

When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.

Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.

I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.

If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.

I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics.

I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.  

I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos.  I'll review the Cannon  once I've had it for a few months

This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output.  I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this.
Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.  And point and shoot is definately not an option.  I thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping.  I've taken over 200 pictures and I will not print any of them.

I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same.
So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it

The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4.  I bought one from 'egghead.com'.  After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format.  They said there is nothing they will do about it.  Do not buy this product.  Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't.  'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date

I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. Please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year, choose something else. It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.

The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the "must buy for mom" list for the 2008 Christmas season.

I very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did

I bought this from another retailer on "black Friday" for half of what Amazon is selling it for and I'm still bringing it back.  I think it's horrible.  I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible!  And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me.  Back to by big old Sony

the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. Compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users I purchased these camera's for. 

Also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly.

I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone

What a pile of junk.  Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  I can't believe they sell this thing.

I was happy at first when I got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.  I was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when I tried re-formatting the card my phone, computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so I ended up throwing it away.  I guess You really get what you pay for

SD card worked fine for a week.
Problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just doesn't work anymore.  
Problem is not the PDA, nor software on it.  Tried to use the card on a separate flash reader/writer.  Tried formatting it to FAT32, create test directory, data stays on for less than one hour. 
I would refrain from buying this product.

I've never ordered anything and been this disappointed.  I ordered two of these and both didn't work.  I contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it.  I tried contacting Ritz Camera where I purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund.  I am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support.  I will never buy another product from this company again.

My wife got this for me for Christmas.  I was thrilled and thought it was a great idea.  I charged the device and transferred pictures to it.  I work in technology, so I agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos, you have to delete them from the device, not the software.  Image quality is OK, but not good enough to be "sharing" with people.  And after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them, it got a bit old.

Other than looking at it "straight-on", nobody on either side of you can see the image.  It's back-lit, which is fine...but it doesn't help much.

Unfortunately, the battery didn't last all that long.  The device refused to charge after about two months, and eventually it died altogether.  The only way to make the unit work was to plug in the USB cable; the battery would not charge. So I contacted "support" and got a basic run-around, telling me that you "shouldn't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours" at a time, and that I could request an RMA to return it for replacement.  Warranty is no good, and it can't be returned.

I'm holding onto it because I'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop "photocube", so it can run off the USB cable.

But I agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly

This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called "Smartparts" is identical to one sold by "Argus."  Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  You buy this, you're on your own.  You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.

In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  Don't pay more.  Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.

The battery does not hold up. After 10 months it would not work at all. I thought it was the battery. Emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable. I found one and changed it out myself. The unit was just dead. Warranty is 60 days.
 Will not buy another one

The idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful. I have it, have pictures on it, but never show it to anyone. Trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous. Easier to show a few pictures in my wallet

I purchased this for my wife for Valentine's Day. The installation went fine but I have two problems with the device. First, the software to do the picture transfers is awful. You can only select pictures on your computer to download - you can't see what photos are on the device in the software. In order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself. I checked the webpage for updated software - no joy. The crop feature is nice (and well used) but otherwise I feel like I am looking at a Windows 3.1 application. Second, the image quality on the device is very poor. I didn't have very high expectations, but this was lower than I expected. Reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens, maybe a bit worse. You can make out the picture, but not much detail at all. The advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea, it's the only way to get a decent picture.

Overall, I'm a little disapointed. But then, you get what you pay for..

DOWNSIDE: 
1. I'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. The camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. I switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. On top of that I now have a memory card with photos on it that I can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that.
2. Not good with indoors pictures ESPECIALLY if you try the "night" mode. If you use that mode, even with a tripod, keep your subjects to still-lifes, only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest, they will at best be blurry, at worst they will look like double exposures.
3. Indoors pictures set at normal mode, with or without flash, are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera.

UPSIDE:
1. Through its USB cable, it booted right into Apple's iPhoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that I took a breeze.
2. Outdoors, with plenty of sunlight, gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. Kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability, given the price.
3. We won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now I have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card

I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006

I gave it two stars because it was great... when it worked.
I got it sometime in January, and it lasted until about June.
I take good care of my things, so I know its not me.
It just suddenly *stopped* working.
I'm more than just a little miffed.
I've tried getting all different types of batteries-
I've tried letting it sit for a while.
I've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff.
Its dead. I just threw it away

I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one.  I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.  However, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used.  I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera

I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!  

The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.  
The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore.

Amazon replaced the original Coolpix P3 because of technical defects but the new one has worst problems. This one does not even focuses at all.
I dont know what to do now because there is no technical service for nikon in my country Venezuela or Latin America. I basicly lost my 300 dollars

this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it. 

the good

*it is compact, which is pretty convenient

*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy. 

the bad

*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over. 

*the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.

*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.

*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry. 

*the user manual left me with a lot of questions

Here is the short version. 

Oct05 
I bought a Fujifilm Finepix F460 digital camera for $299.99. 

Nov06 
Camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating 
bright/dark horizonal strips across them. 

Jan07 
I sent the camera in to Fujifilm's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires. 

Jan07 
The service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 (I spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if I accepted). 

Feb07 
I contacted the service center and stated that I think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse. And that I don't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired. The service rep, named Christina, asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do. I complied. 

Mar07 
Fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that I did not reply to the estimate. 

Now 
I will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera, its memory card, and the shipping I paid.

The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one!

We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations.
To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.  
I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.  
I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.  

I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.  

Overall, I am stuck.  If I record something interesting I will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (The camera shots great video

I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality.  At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.  

Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.  

I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.  I know now that I should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker.  I thought I'd get more use this route

Hi,

I have had the VDR-D300 for about 6 months now.  I have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min.  The camcorder constantly locks up, usually after about 10 min.  This is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm.  Several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works.  I must have a faulty unit.  I'm investigating repair.  The unit has a great lens, camera, and video image, but my unit is not stable at all

Amazon picture shows an original Japanese-produced NP-40 with 3.7V and 710mAh (just like the one I got with my F810). What I got was a Fujifilm-branded Chinese-produced NP-40 with 3.6V and 750 mAh. YES, IT WORKS, but it's just obviously cheaper. Skepticism is a virtue

This product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  This little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). I initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128MB card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. A firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but I could never get the file to load into the frame. Another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  It would have been nice to hear a RANDOM music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. Definitely NOT worth the price. Shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback

-- Update 4/23/2007 - The vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame, and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below. --

Picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results. Appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished, but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the LCD display mars the effect somewhat.

At 5.6 inches, this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close. The images are smaller than a 4x6 print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand. I found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away. On an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better. The size of the LCD also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular, true of any frame in this category. 

My biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware (~3/2007), it will only display up to about 250 pictures. I expected that what ever was on the memory card I inserted would be displayed.

Overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos.  I am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer's product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it

I love my Nikon Coolpix 5900 however, the lens failed in less than one year. Service took 6 weeks to repair. The lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair. Why is the lens failing to open again? I absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although I do have a paid plan for it. Why can't warranty be fast, local and competent

I bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  I sent it into Nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. The repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22.

I am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  Battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time I had it. 

For this reason I would never buy another Nikon product again.  Next digital camera will charge without removing battery.  

Camera takes GREAT pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty. 

Bye Bye Nikon

I was very disappointed in Nikon's service.  This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile.  When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't!  I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke.  To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.  

I will NEVER by a Nikon product again.  If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it.

I won this camera in a contest and now I'm kinda wishing I never had.  Practically everything I've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another.  From the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on, to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations, to the camera recording glitches in the audio when I capture onto my computer.  I know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but I really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a Canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems

The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  

Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  

Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.

Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price

You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.

Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)

Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories

I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called "Thin Fire Wire". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.

Shame on you Sony

Instead of this pick up a Plextor convertor box.  It takes the output of the camcorder (composite/RCA or S-Video) and compresses that to mpeg-2 (DVD) or mpeg-4 (or DivX) and includes software which easily burns that to DVD or CD (mpeg-1 or mini DVD).  Look for Plextor's M402U box.  Unless you really want to deal with 3.125 MB of data per second (25 Mbps), or about 180 MB per minute, or about 11 GB per hour through the firewire link, get the M402U.  Your options will be greatly expanded, and you won't tell the difference by looking

I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot

I bought my Kodak V570 less than a year ago. At first the only annoyance I had was the fact that I had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in MOV format that made it diffcult to edit. But a few months ago, the focus refused to work properly. In wide angle, it was fine but when I zoomed in, the image was unacceptably blur. I tried every setting, finally gave up and called Kodak service. I was asked to mail the camera to Sydney from Melbourne where I live. A few weeks later, the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. Since I still could not take acceptable pictures, I contacted them again. This time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. I did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. But the pictures were taken in broad daylight. When I disagreed with the logic of the comment, I was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. But the number they gave me was a fax number. Using my resources, I got in touch with technical service by phone. This time I was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright, it's probably due to shaky hands! It's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. It is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent India trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. Now I have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. There is no way I will ever buy another Kodak again. I can recommend it only to my worst enemies. I have now to, again, send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far, I am not holding my breath for answers. Still want to buy a Kodak? Go ahead but don't say I did not warn you. By the way, my other camera is a Casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not

I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera. It takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. It is quite compact and has a nice screen. The software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface.

Why 2 stars? Ok here's the bad stuff:

1) In the first shipment I got, the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. The images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. The ultra-wide images were fine. I attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. The second V570 I got from Amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. So, I don't think it is just a random problem. There appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that I would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. My V570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and I use a Casio Exilim EX-Z70. 

2) The stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. You have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. Also, since you have to charge the battery in the camera, you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. For comparison, my new Casio EX-Z70 has a USB cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. So, if one battery is dead I can leave it behind in the charger while I take pictures with the spare.

3) The movies that you take with this camera are stored in MOV format instead of AVI or MPEG. While it does play in most PCs if you have installed Quicktime, it is not supported by my streaming media player (D-Link DSM-320RD) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/DVD creator SW I use (Sonic MyDVD). I can't say how widely MOV is supported compared to AVI and MPEG, but that format created problems for me.

So, I applaud Kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. But I think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations

Bought this as an XMAS present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. I'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/Phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, Sony memory sticks).

The internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.

I've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a PC friendly device, it's certainly not always Mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.

I wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.

Also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - NO SUPPORT for the new, MS ProDuo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)

I thought I would get a quality product from Phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one I've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.

Don't waste your time and dollars.......................

The quality of the pictures are nice WHEN they will actually print.  Unless you use the printer with your camera ON the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work.  If you decide to crop the picture on your PC and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work!  I have had it for sometime now and I have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing.

This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works.  It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works.  The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink.  I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time.  Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap.  I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine.  This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!!

Terrible product.  Printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  I've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  Even though I have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which I have had less than a year, Kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and I need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  A new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  I told Kodak support I would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. I further notified Kodak that I would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill.

Also, I've heard that the recommended fix (which does not work, by the way), unplugging the unit to reset, will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely.  With the cost of paper and cartridges, this last insult makes this printer one to avoid.  1 star because when it does print the prints look good, but, man, the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price.  Rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public.  Total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product.

Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera

I was counting on a THREE HOUR working battery. After all, that's what it says it gives you.  So far all I get from it, after more than a month of use, is two hour, max..

I made mistake getting such a big & bulky case for small MiniDV Sony camcorder HC26. This case can take any big size old camcorders (like old Sony Hi8), so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice

The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.

The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.

The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer.

Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract

...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera

I purchased this camera for my own birthday present last October.  I have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it isn't working.  I paid $400.00 for it last year when it was "new."  The LCD will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after I take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off. I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer.  I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period.  They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00.  I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment.  I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!  Buy a different camera - I wish I had

After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware.

DSC Series camera all have a CCD imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years. (Do a google search. You will find out what happened.) Sony knew this problem years ago. But refuse to fix it. They will wait until the camera fail and then charge you $300 to fix it. That's what happens to my DSC-F717. Ever wondering why Dell, HP etc all recall Sony battery for laptop, but Sony did not recall their own laptop battery? Sony will never fix their own problem. We the customer have to pay for their mistake.

I bought this in August 2005, when the original battery that came with my Nikon Coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  On the page I ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine Nikon battery, however, when I received it, it was not.  It was made in Taiwan, and does not have the Nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as I remember).  This battery has never held a charge well.  It's about as bad as the original battery is now, and I've only had it a few months.  Maybe I just got a lemon--but I'd recommend you buy a genuine Nikon, if you can find one

I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.

These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.

For the price, these can't be beat

I bought this camera for myself during Christmas 2004.

It was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--I don't trust digital cameras for family photos.

The Kodak CX7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp.

The flaw in this camera didn't appear until I pulled it out of the drawer some months later. The camera wouldn't turn on. I checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. I eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked.

The next time I took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. And the time after that.

At first, I thought the CX7300 was eating the batteries. But eventually I came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. It won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries.

The Kodak batteries that came with the CX7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong.

I contacted Kodak about this flaw. They wanted to talk about what kind of batteries I'm using--Kodak--or the option of my purchasing a Camera Dock and some rechargeable batteries. A solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent.

I thought that buying an optional AC Adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. Surprise, surprise, the CX7300 is one of the few digital cameras Kodak makes that doesn't take one.

So, now that I'm way past warranty, what do I do with it?

I'm shopping for another camera

My camera has broken in less than one year of owning it.  Because I received it as a gift I don't have the proof of purchase so Kodak will not fix my camera for no cost.  What a lemon the CX7300 is.  First of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture.  What's broken?  I can take one picture before the batteries go dead.  I change the batteries, one picture.  Change the batteries again, one picture

I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.
-first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.
-It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken.
-It eats up batteries like crazy
-It takes forever to turn on
-If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight
-The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home
-It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice.

I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck

I am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible. I took about 400 shots with my Digital Rebel XT and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that I immediately returned it / got a refund. 

In all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus. In many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it's entire range. Since most of my photography is of animals I simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots.

I tested the autofocus against my Canon 18-55 EF-s (packaged with the Rebel XT) and a Canon 75-300 EF. In every instance where the Tamron could not focus the Canon lenses had no problem! When the Tamron would focus I found the pictures were not as sharp as my Canon lenses. Again I'm far from an expert however I was only printing 4x6 photos.

I replaced the Tamron with a Quantaray(Sigma) 55-200 DC which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality(for amatuers..) 

Bottom line.. It was hard to part with the Tamron because I was really enthused about the zoom range however I would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't. I have read many reviews with the same problem noted. Tamron needs to get thier act together

These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.

For the price, these can't be beat

I originally purchased the Samsung DUOCAM SCD6040.  It fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  The video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  Though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  The repaired camera came back broken.  I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a "lemon" and they sent me the SCD6550.  Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.  I cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  It is not under warranty.  I can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  They must use cheap parts.  PLEASE save yourself the headache and chose another brand.

I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much

I have many pet peaves about this camera.

a) the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark----don't try to record indoors

b) didn't fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button. NOT GOOD

c) didn't start up fast enough---I always missed the shot

d) the camera photos aren't of good quality

e) microphone not that great---you couldn't even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera.

f) if your laptop is over 3 years old, even if you've got Windows XP, don't expect the software to be compatible.

g) the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger. I'd lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out. I felt like I had to just manually zoom----ie. walk up closer to the subject

I honestly say stay away from the Samsung's and the Sony's aren't much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories, ie. only Sony products are compatible with the camcorder.

I finally bought a JVC and they are awesome----the take more light in, better acoustical recording, better zoom function, quicker start up, and lighter. You can even buy the cheapest model (which is pretty much what I've got) and the picture is great! My parents commented on how they thought I must have a camera like the News reporters, as it's the same quality

To add on to the previous reviewers, I was very disappointed with this camera's performance.  I compared the "5 megapixel" photos with photos taken with my Canon, PowerShot G3 (4megapixels), and the SCD6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills.  The camera itself also seemed flimsy.  The idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive.  But another attractive concept, Canon's Elura50, offered a camcorder with a compact design.  In the end, however, it broke down only after a year and a half.  For a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan (cf. reviews for Elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems).  This camera seemed less durable than the Elura50 as I maneuvered the various parts and dials.  Of course, I am returning the camera before it can prove its durability.  Nevertheless, maybe the folks at CNet can stake their money on it.  Lastly, I should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed.  I found that I had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button.  This definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments.

Again, this camera is a great idea.  But, I suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording.  This one is on the right track, but, still so far from accomplishing a quality product.

The SCD6550 is a great idea, but just doesn't preform as I had hoped.  I was looking for one camera to take on vacation, replacing carrying a 2 year old Sony MiniDV and a 5 MP Sony CyberShot.  My Sony takes 1 MP stills, has excellent video, but @ 1MP, the stills are not nearly print worthy.  This camera is actually smaller and lighter than my Sony.

The 5MP still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside.  Shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the Sony CyberShot.  

Digital video is this unit's short coming.  I did identical shots inside and outside with the Sony and Samsung.  The Samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality.  Inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable.  Outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the Sony.  I took it back, will keep the Sony's and hope that Sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 MP model soon

These are NOT pioneer boxes.  These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's.  Do not buy these.

Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer.  But then their own website also has named them Pioneer.  Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  It is my honest opinion.

I have to agree with the other reviews of this scope.  I purchased this scope as a Christmas gift.  When I opened it, the equatorial mount (the basis for the ENTIRE scope) was broken.  I contacted Celestron and was promised another part for it, which never arrived.  I contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me.  It DIDN'T FIT.  Finally, I was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope.  The equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah!  Too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and I could not assemble this one. I even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support (who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived) and all I got was a bunch of excuses.
I finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one ENTIRE telescope.  It's February and I just now have a product that works.  (I haven't had time to try it though!)  Celestron offered no refunds for this telescope, so buyer beware.  If they are not willing to satisfy customers, your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells. Good luck

First off, many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....I cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the TWO that were sent to me were BROKEN!

I ordered well before Christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from Santa Claus.  My husband opened the telescope up late Christmas Eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the Christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken.  The 2 mounting screws were  bent, very bent.  This puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child.

After A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT with Amazon's customer service (from another country!) they sent a replacement...to the WRONG ADDRESS!!  (long story that I will not bore you with.)

When the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what?  They same screws were again bent.  The box on the outside was not damaged, but something is not working for them.

I am so disapointed with them.  This was the first time I had purchased something this big from Amazon.  I have mainly done music and movies, small stuff. 

After this experience I will NO LONGER buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage.  It's just not worth the headache and problems, not to mention DISAPOINTMENT, to my son.  

I would proceed with caution when ordering this item from Amazon.  If you get a broken one...you just might be receiving the 2 I have had to return

This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.

The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. 

The finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  And don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.  

I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress na�ve buyers with its complex "scientific" appearance.  

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.

This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

3.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

My ownership of this camera was brief.  First, you must know I love Nikon.  I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700.  They have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  I thought my experience with this model would be similar.  NOT!~  From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  What a dissappointment!  I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera.  I suppose it is just what it is.  If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows?  Anyway,  that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800

Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!

So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.
But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!

I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP

I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.

I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together

On reciept of the tripod, I found it wrapped and packed (on the outside)in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product.  When I opened the box, I found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box.  There was minimal packing around the tripod itself, mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching, and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around.  I have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping.  Also, if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company, instructions are not part of their package

I own the Olympus FE-100 Digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). I switched to Energizer Batteries and bought an Energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. It's not a quick charger like this one, but I say for less than half the investment, I've got a charger that does the job. I would NOT spend this kind of money on a charger. So I say, if you're part of the "gotta have it now" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. Otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money

Two months. . .the amount of time in which I saved to purchase what I thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal. . .

One week. . .to find that no matter what I tried I was utterly dissapointed. . .

1)No matter the setting EVERY picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than I horrible blur.

2)The 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible. . .every person I try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90% horrible family photos. 

I could go on but I wont. . .I cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money. . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon. . .BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

I now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera

I ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken.

The assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic.    I asked for an RMA order via E-Mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.'

Being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with I tried repair it myself.  Where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.  

Even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all.

The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck

I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!

I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.

These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.

For the price, these can't be beat

This kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. Unfortunately, Kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.

Fine, I thought, I'll buy a separate cartridge. Guess what? You can't! Kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. Why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? Seems pretty dirty

I purchased, through work, the PowerShot S70 in July of 2005.  I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!

The flash and door problem occurred while I was in Yosemite NP, so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning.  

Now, the warranty is expired and I hold my breath every time I slide the lens door open.  I have no faith in the Canon S70 and have lost a lot faith in Canon products as a whole.

The only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks, which I thought was fast for warranty work

I received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it. It screws in over the regular ZOOM lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the KODAK DX6490. I suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future. The lens adapter by itself, doesn't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else ???

I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it

I just got this printer dock with a camera, and the printer feature is a real pain!  The paper will almost never feed no matter what I've tried.  When it does feed, it ends up jamming.  I only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone.  I'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back

I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and haven't even gotten to try it out yet--the print cartridge that came with it didn't work.  I ordered another and inserted it and it still doesn't work. It constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced.  Lots of time and money involved in this mess---stick with HP!

Here's the Good News: 
I have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and I have found the Z1 to be my favorite.  The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color.  My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good.  The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily.  Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.

Here's the Bad News:
Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible.  Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.  

Summary:
Great camera as long as it doesn't break.  It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it

I bought the camera in May of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  He loved the style and compactness.

He experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  Unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or I might have been able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Contacting Fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. Their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (LONG WAITS).  They have had the toy camera (AS THIS IS BEING WRITTEN)for over a week and when I called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera "hasn't been diagnosed yet".  I expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit Fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  I have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  I might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.

If you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  If it ever requires repairs, you might feel as I that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  Save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  You may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  I bought it in May of 2006....I feel like I lost it in July of 2006.

IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THE Z1 LESS THEN 1 STAR, I WOULD HAVE.  THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES!   !&%$$##444EN FUJIFIL

Bought this camera for my wife.  Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  Fuji customer relations is sub-par.  Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future

I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it

The battery which "popped up" with my camera order does NOT match the camera.  Thus I am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery.  I was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so I had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived.

This is absolutely the worse digital device I have ever owned.  The manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  I try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  I can't download photos from my Mac.  If your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.

If you want to load directly from your camera's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card.  There is no "copy all" function.

Loading information from a computer didn't work.  The USB connection was not recognized by Windows XP and I couldn't find any drivers on the Web.

A setup CD would be a nice addition.

BTW the screen was not as large as one might think.  It is very wide but not tall and it crops the top & bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people

I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do

I received Pandigital 7" Photo Frame (DPF70-2) as a Christmas gift and haven't been able to get the SD Card slot to function. When connecting to the PC via USB cable it tells me the removable device needs to be formatted.  Windows attempts to format the card and fails.  I'm able to format the card with a USB Card Reader and copy pictures to the SD card OK.  When I insert the SD Card into the Photo Frame is doesn't display any of the pictures, just a blue frame around the picture location.

I contacted PanDigital Tech Support via 800# and never received a call back so I sent them an email.  I received email response back after several days.  They had me try several things to resolve the issue; this troubleshooting process went on for more than week to no avail. They eventually acknowledged the Photo Frame appeared defective, When I asked to exchange the Photo Frame (taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site), they told me to return it to the store it was purchased.

I do not consider this very good customer service; I would not recommend this product.

Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation.

The Good: 
* Screen is bright, images look great
* Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen. 
* Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue.

The bad: 
My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!  

I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price.

Some details:
* Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the "setup" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global
* Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen.
* Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this "feature" off.
* The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change.
* No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily 
get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system.
* Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens

Keep in mind that you can't use this product unless you buy an external flash. The built-in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos. 

canon's response


Thank you for your inquiry regarding the PowerShot G6.
We are sorry to hear of any issues with the Conversion lens.

When using the built-in flash, a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark. 
Please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information. 
When the converters are used, it is recommended to not use the built-in flash.

Thank you for choosing Canon

I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products

I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250

Ok this is the third Sony Handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..Sony Messed up with the USB port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the TRV 280

i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the TRV 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy.. im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the TRV280 back..



I hope this has helpe

Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge

We ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours.
It stopped working all of the sudden (no power)

Sent it for warranty, (part no labor). $160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it.

Would not but another camcorder from Panasonic (they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back)

I have tried everything. Firewire, USB. There was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your PC then to your camera, then turn on the PC then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order. If you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged. What kind of a crazy world does Panasonic live in?

Well, I followed the instructions to the tee, downloded the right drivers and all and yet my PC does not recognize the GS19 or the GS9. I have used both. The GS19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back. I thought, this model would have gone away with the kinks but, NO!

So, my panasonic recorded DVs are gonna remain on the tape. I will never be able to put them on DVDs. What a joke, this camera turned out to be

One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website.

DEFINITELY find another brand

This camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio, however, I was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members. I took it back and bought a mini-DV camcorder as I was told it was easier to make copies. This has yet to be tested

This camcorder worked well, but I had two complaints with it.
1.  On the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker.  This alone made it unacceptable or what I wanted to do.
2.  I wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk.  This causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which I need to do.
If you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable.  I returned it and bought a Panasonic PV-GS35miniDV camcorder which uses the miniDV cassette tape.  Much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive

Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy!

Don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  I ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  Did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  Now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  This is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  AVOID AT ALL COST, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PAYING THE EXTRA $10 BUCKS FOR AN ORIGINAL KODAK BRANDED BATTERY

This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.

As I have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult, as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus.  I thought this might be a solution.

This Eyecup fails on all requards.  Worst feature, the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect.  Second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless.   Last it has the cheep feel of Cracker Jack plastic, well and the optics to match.  Now I know where Olympus had it manufactured

The ME-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on Olympus's E-300 and E-500 cameras. Ideally, this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing. Unfortunately, this did not happen when I used the ME-1 to make a number of trial images with my E-500, so I will be returning the ME-1 for a refund. (For the record, I wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting, with my "shooting eye" corrected to 20/20 vision.) 

Like other folks, I find the E-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time. The camera must also be pressed against your face when framing, which is not always comfortable. 

In some ways, the ME-1 created more problems than it solved. The ME-1 kept the camera further from my face (though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses), but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder. Divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares. The four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible, but those along the sides, top, and bottom were *less* visible than before, the corners considerably less. To frame a shot, I had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the ME-1 than without it. To see exposure data, I had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image. More hassle than I need when shooting in the field.

Fortunately, there is another option that works for me. The E-300 and E-500 come with an EP-5 eyecup, which is definitely too small for my taste. But a larger eyecup is also available, the EP-6. The EP-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face. And with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted (a critical step no one seems to mention), the EP-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all. 

All of this will vary from person to person, of course, and there may be circumstances when the ME-1 is exactly what's needed -- so two rather than one star. But not in standard shooting conditions, especially if you need to compose, set exposure, and shoot quickly

Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!

So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.
But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!

I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP

I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.

If you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that? I have a T1 that does the trick there and gives 5MP. 
Ok, so maybe video? ok, but then why do I want a dvd with nothing but raw footage? cant edit it without a lot of work. (where is the firewire port, or even the ability to edit an mpg file?) geeez.. 
anyway.. I am taking mine back. it is totally useless to me as I already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it..

This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller. I ended up going with a great case that i found at Wal-Mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town

This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery. The belt clip is difficult to use, and I end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. There are better cases for this camera

This case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. It only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. There are other cases available with better features for less money

I found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper.

It's made by Samsonite.  model # TM90BLU (there is also a black case).  but like I said, exact same thing.  Unless you care about your camera case saying "lumix", save yourself some dough and get the one from Wal-mart

This is the first digital camera that I have owned.  Overall I am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces.  However, there are a few things that, if I had known beforehand, would have prevented me from purchasing this camera.

1) Camera is not plug-and-play (even if they say it is).  You have to install the Kodak EasyShare Software to download pictures.  This is a HUGE negative.  In the future, I will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer.

2) Video is stored in Apple Quicktime format (*.mov).  The is also a huge negative.  The codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration.  You have to download and use Apple Quicktime to view them.  You can not view the videos in Windows Media Player.  It is also not compatible with some photo-album software.  I would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format.

Update:  After review, I have found that WinXP and Vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the USB port.  It does not work on Win2k.  Thanks for the comment that made me double-check

I like this camera.  Some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience. For a first-timer, it has been great. The camera rates 4 stars.

Customer service, on the other hand, has been a disaster. An Easy Share software downloaded update didn't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution. After requesting to speak to a customer service manager, I was promised that a $7.95 CD of the software would be sent for free (though it was clear he was doing me a favor because "these cd's cost money and don't grow on trees," he said. Whether or not the CD solves the problem remains to be seen. But customer service is awful.

To recap: Nice camera, but unless you have endless customer service patience, search out other options

I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.
The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.

There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.

I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't

I bought this product from a nearby retailer. The packaging is deceptive. The Photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. The battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. This frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. This is an additional expense. After purchasing the Photoframe I discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. I took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before I found one which had an unbroken frame. I took that Photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. I then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). With the retailer's very helpful clerks I tested three more PhotoCo Photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). I returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email I requested a refund for the price of the battery. Photoco replied that if I sent them the battery they would refund its price. I mailed the battery on May 6,and then inquired about my refund on May 14. PhotoCo replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. On 3/17 I sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. PhotoCo said that my credit had been processed but that I might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. I still have not received my credit for the battery. If you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. Read the other reviews before considering this product

NOWHERE on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card (MS or SD).  It will not operate without it!  On the back of the package it reads "Download photos with USB cable (incl.) or simply insert memory card (MS or SD - not incl.)"  Wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot

The Photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering.  The "Plug and Play" ability is aggravating, at best, freezing two of my computers, requiring endless reboots to transfer images.  Photoshare provides ZERO customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual. The expensive battery is almost impossible to install.  The power cord has to be super glued to stay in place. And the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out.  Buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable DVD player instead.

Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be "portable" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.

I added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city. Make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from CC, or else you will end up like me. With a huge box (you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries

This unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw.  I received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power.  After that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on.  It then failed completely and would not work at at all.

I returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that. On both units the mp3 player continued to work.  

There is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch.  

But for this problem it would be a wonderful unit

Tried this as a possible improvement over using AA NiHM batteries in my Olympus D-524 camera. Turned out to be a DOWNGRADE. Did not stay charged as long as my Panasonic 1950 mAh AA batts. It would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down. I have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the AA NiHM batts. The CR-V3 now gathers dust. It did not even improve the flash recycle time. Just a waste

THE battery is good after a full charge.  It lacks in holding the promised charge.  I find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. I got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, Which is more that my AA nimh 2100mah. Which I bought from Walmart {so probably not a super battery}  The wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.The charge time is not to long when charger from half charge.
Over all, I hope the next ones I buy will be better than these.  My solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the Delkin dies.  I also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  I also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  Every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  My Nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  All reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  Have been using 3 months now.

I've had this battery for half a year and I agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power. I am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory, but this Delkin model's life span was noticeably short. Now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because I don't want to buy another Delkin battery

I bought this battery in July 2004. I charged it as soon as I got it. I put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. The battery was dead. So I charged it again and put it in the camera again. I used it and it seemed to work fine. But the next time I went to use the camera (Approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. As I write this review I am sitting in a hotel room in Prague. I charged the battery ten days ago. I used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(Did not use the flash). I then used it again today. I was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( Did not use the flash). I bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. So now I have to charge the battery everytime I use the camera. This was a big disappointment. I get better life out of the standard Duracell alkalines. It appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that Belkin has not perfected their quality control. Beware when buying this product

  I purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews I could on the different kinds. The one I purchased was flawed, and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before I could get it to boot up. When it was running I was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures.
  What the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. This means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera, or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( A side note - if you have a Sony digital camera, Memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent, you took with another camera, or you reformatted with a photo program). 
  I went with the digital pic frame from Brookstone instead - far better quality, and MUCH more user friendly

In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate

I am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 Mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! Read on!

If you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on Page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. This is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.) 

Looking further on p13 it states: "Choosing slideshow frequency Note: This function applies to photos stored on all media." Page 27 in FAQ states: "2) Q: Can I switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? A: Yes. When you connect your memory card to PhotoFrame(tm), it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card." Finally, the Quick start guide FAQ states: "Q Can I switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? A Yes, Digital Photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected." 

Clearly the three references I provide indicate that the DPF can operate slideshows from a media card. IN REALITY SLIDESHOWS FROM MEDIA CARDS DOES NOT WORK. Philips how about a firmware upgrade?

I bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. I was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. All she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (Mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). Do not buy this DPF for older, none computer savvy people. Since media card can not be used, you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. The internal 16Mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. It is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. I believe the internal memory converts the file to a DPF friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (How is Mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?)
Why have media card slots if they are useless? Internal memory is way too small! DO NOT BUY and save yourself the hassle.

I ordered this digital frame for my husband for Christmas, with the assurance from a "tech weenie" that it would work, based on the advertisement found at Amazon. Still uncertain whether the ad (also found in Philips cursory literature) is really true. My husband is working with the "phone people" at Philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with MAC. If it does eventually work, the process has not been easy

I bought this camera for its great price, good reviews, and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. I returned the camera after three weeks, however, due to abysmal low light performance among other things.

The catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. I took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. Unfortunately, when we returned home to view our footage, much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes.

The camera does include a light and a MagicPix option, but unless you're using a tripod, you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (Perfect for recreating "Thriller music videos," but not much help otherwise.)

I also found the image quality with the GS31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. Granted, you get what you pay for, but I was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage.

That being said, the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated), and the zoom is incredible. The camera is very light and smaller than I anticipated.

In the end, I returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...)

I will say that Amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. Also, if you do buy this camera, make sure to buy the DV cable (firewire for Macs) through Amazon or some other online retailer. (...

We returned this video camera due to video picture quality. The camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a "grainy" look. We just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. Purchased the PV-GS65, next model up with 3CCD's and love this model. As a matter a fact we still had the GS-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the GS-65 did 100% better. 

The camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press

I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck

I was extremely disappointed with this camera.  It's a shame there is no option for zero stars, because it doesn't even deserve one.  I bought two of them for a vacation to Belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water, and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera.  Now I really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can. 

All of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible, terrible quality.  The camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water.  Those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of.  Extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water.  Not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none, so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives.

I was so disappointed in this camera that I wrote to Kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras.  Unfortunately our trip to Belize was a once in a lifetime trip, so I have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done.  And I have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. If you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories, DO NOT waste your money on this one.  The only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment.  I wish I had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it

My husband and I bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. Due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  One we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. The other I took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, I could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. After fighting with it the entire weekend, I ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too

I purchased this camera and took it to the beach.  The photos were so bad, I threw them away.  The images were all washed-out and blurry.  Also, the film advancing mechanism is very tricky, so several of the pictures I took overlapped each other.  I've used other disposable cameras before that wouldn't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame.  With this camera, I advanced the film until the mechanism stopped, and the camera allowed me to take another picture.  Unfortunately, the film hadn't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that I had taken.  What a waste of money this camera was!

Thankfully, I had also taken my digital camera, so I still had some good pictures of my trip :)

I bought this camera after using a Sony MiniDV (very small one) camera over 8 years. The image quality of Sanyo is horrible compared to my old Sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. However price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. So if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.

I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try.

After one battery charge, I was "lucky" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge.

My observations from that first short use were:
- Quality of pictures was very poor (my Pentax Optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera.
- The flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality
- The camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands.  My wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes.
- The video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy).
- I had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality).

All-in-all don't waste your money.  You can get a much better camera at a lower price

This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB. However, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. The clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation.

We returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect, but the second unit had the same problem. Apparently, according to the manual, this is "not a malfunction"

In theory, this camera is perfect. Fits into your pocket. Video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of MPEG-4. Pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. Perfect all around anytime camrea, right?

Here's the thing. I got the camera mainly for video. I just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that I could always have on me. Also, I did not want miniDV because uploading to the computer is real time. I wanted the SD card as film, even if it would sacrfice some video quality. But the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie. On the playback I cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses. It sounds like someone smoking a hooka. And get this, it even says so in the instruction manual, page 35, "CAUTION During video clip playback, the sound of a motor is audible....During recording, the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded. This is not a malfunction."

Awful.

By the way, the take a picture while recording video function is worthless. It leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording, and the still image captured is usually blury. Whats the point anyway, I think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video. Or you can do it with whatever editing software you use.

Oh, and one last thing. I have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic. My hand shakes too much. There is a digital stabalization for the video, but no optical stabilization for the stills.

Its a big shame, too. The camera is very cool. If not for the audible motor noise, I would have given this at least an 8/10. But the lens motor noise is unacceptable!

ps. all cameras today should have a built in lens cover. This is one has a cheap plastic one, that you'll probably lose

I really wanted to love this camera. The camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans! 

I did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so I expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. The 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! Another huge plus is that each "shot" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a PC using a USB cable. No further processing - the file just copies and plays in Quicktime, etc. Another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.

Now the sad part; Amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the LCD and CCD. The bad pixels on the LCD, according to the manual, are expected and "Not a malfunction"; I disagree with that. For the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the LCD monitor. The HUGE problem is the bad pixels on the CCD! This results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the "image stabilization". The image stabilization shifts the image the CCD receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! However, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. It's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.

The bad CCD is the reason why I can't love the C6... I gave up hope and sent both back to Amazon. I'm not sure what I will buy now.

HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!

I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.

so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like "um... is THAT it???" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... 

also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all... 

other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.

I bought this camera in the beginning of January. I was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. Based on test reports at DPreview and other customer reports I decided for the Fuji F31fd. I was intrigued by the new sensor that Fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. After receiving the camera I took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different ISO settings, different exposure times, etc. I compared the pictures with my 4-year old SONY DSC-V1 and the results were amazing. The picture quality of the Fuji was very poor. Colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. Even under bright light conditions and ISO 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (RGB noise). I didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. What a disappointment. The lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the SONY DSC-V1 with a Carl Zeiss lens. After one week we returned the camera and I bought the SONY H5. This is really a great camera, I must admit. The picture quality is even better than with the V1 and I thought that the V1 was already pretty good. I can only recommend SONY's H5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller F31fd. What I liked about the F31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. However, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help

I bought these binoculars because I wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding.  First time out, I had difficulty getting a clear focus.  To make maters worse, every bird that I looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head.  I have a pair of Nikon 10X25s which out performed the Bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. I am returning the Bushnell's and considering the Audubon Equinox HP binoculars instead.

...unless you want to have trouble focusing, have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event, or have the neck strap bracket break off, etc. I wear glasses and these never did focus well for me. I was not happy when the bracket broke off the day I received them, just as I was to leave for an Africa safari vacation. The biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip, and it was frustrating. 

Even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired. Suposedly there is a warranty on these. Hah! When I sent them to Bushnell for repair, they wanted [...]

In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing.

The quality is not real HD looking.  The footage is jumpy.  The camera is terrible in low light.  Even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image.  I returned mine and I'm looking to getting the much better Sony HD cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it.  Being a professional filmmaker and knowing what Cameras shoot real HD, I quickly realized that I got ripped off.  This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night.  It seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent.  The size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great.  I was really disappointed because I was expecting something better.  Most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously

Before that it was kind of nice, but it cannot focus in even semi-low light.
It is definitely light and easy to take everywhere, but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing. No way I would call the output HD quality, just the best SD ever with a 16 * 9  format. And then it broke

I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem

This camera has major problems.  Do your research.  Go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of  the "black Screen".    After using our camera about 5 times the screen became black.  Apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something.  Sent it to their customer care service.  Took 1 month to get back.  3 days later black screen is back.  Sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera.  They just want me to keep sending to customer. Care.     Sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras.  See for yourself.   Go to the forums and see what others have been saying.  Don't make the mistake I did

The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.

The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.

The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer.

I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!!
So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon.

I purchased a Nikon for my first camera, I just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. I couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. For my birthday I took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. I was so devistated. The video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. My friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. So maybe I just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a LOW BATTERY that it just might not want to hold them. A major plus I do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! That I'll give 5 stars to...everything else I'd have to say 2 stars!

I bougt this camera because I had had a Sony Coolpix 3, which took great pictures.  With this camera, you can never get it adjusted right.  If you use the flash the  pictures are to light, if you dont they are too dark.  It is a constant battle with this little cute camera. Worse camera purchase I ever made.

I agree with reviewer Steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless.  The paper works says the "may" focus down to 35'.  Maybe some will but not certainly not my pair.  I am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard.  And no, the rubber eye caps ABSOLUTELY will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses (like me).

My cheap 10X50 Rugged Exposure brand binoculars give me a better view.  The rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and I couldn't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round "binocular effect".  I did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either.  Maybe with perfect vision they would work for, but I doubt it

It has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it, but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time I used it. It's extremely annoying because overall it's not a bad tripod, but it really didn't need that bit of "hi-tech", and now I am unable to use the telescopic part at all... 

Yes, it's lightweight and somewhat unstable, but I can live with that. The biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials...

I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera

There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!

I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.

This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??

This is the 7th Olympus camera I've owned over the years, from film to digital.  I have always been very pleased with Olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  This camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in RAW, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process RAW images.  This renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in JPEG.  Olympus should have ensured that vendors such as Adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible RAW conversion Plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  There's no excuse for Olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible.

Having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  You can take quite good pictures.  However, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken.

The battery life is very good.  The camera fits nicely in your palm. And, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.  

If you don't shoot in RAW and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  Otherwise, look at other products at this time

I was so excited to buy a camcorder that recorded straight to DVD AND took pictures.......Well, the picture quality is AWFUL! I have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000........The problem is its SO low in pixels. We hear about 5MP cameras and up, this camera has less than 1MP!!!! I bought this before I knew anything about megapixels........You have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent. All of my prints from this camera are bad! And they are only good for email. That's it. The camcorder capabilities are fair. My problem is that it doesn't work well on the computer, and it does NOT play immediately in all dvd players. You HAVE to buy the very expensive RAM discs for editing....Overall, I definitely would NOT buy again and I would not reccommend to a friend. I wish I had spent all that money on something else....

This camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. In indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad. I tried to record in my living room where I have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred. In outdoor recording in a sunny day, picture quality is quite good with sharp colors. Zoom works well

Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one

The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event.
There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much).
There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket.
Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches.
If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will

The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before

In the past, I have considered Amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites. To be perfectly honest, I am no longer sure. Two months ago, I bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on Amazon. This camera set was called the 1 GB Stylus 720 SW kit. Ironically, the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 GB cards! My first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories. Two weeks after receiving the kit, I emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake. After waiting a few weeks for a response, I decided to send them a second email. Again, no response. By this point, I felt helpless and turned to Amazon for aid. Surprisingly, Amazon was not much better than 47th st photo. Minutes after sending the email to Amazon, I received an automatic email informing me that Amazon had received my email. That was the last I heard from Amazon. More than two months have passed and I have not heard from either company

I have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime I use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds.  I returned my camcorder and got another one (pvgs65) and I am still having this problem.  everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus.

If anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review.

So, you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a Panasonic PB-GS65 DV camcorder. It is a digital video camcorder, after all. That's why you bought it. Well, guess what? It doesn't come with a DV cable to plug it into anything. That is so pathetically stupid I take it as an outright slap from a company that must think I'm just some sort pain in their shorts. It cost me completion of a project that I had to put together as soon as the camera arrived. So, Panasonic, I'll post a negative review of as many of your products I possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as I've ever had to deal with. Oh yeah, and you're camcorder is being returned. Go buy a cable and have a ball

We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders.  However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working.  It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center.  They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  I only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  Panasonic did not honor our warranty

Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to "evaluate" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the "evaluation" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc). 
 Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!!
Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!

Cons only, no pros:
the velcro closure is week and opens easily
terrible look
the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless
no space for extra memory or battery
attaches only to a very small belt
the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash

Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.

The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense.
Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.
Other than the above, the monocular has performed well.
epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it.

I bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. Once I spotted a deer and turned on the "IR" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much

The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.  

Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.

The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.  

Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.  

By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic

It was suggested by Amazon.com that I buy this product since I was purchasing a Canon PowerShot S2IS Digital Camera. Not knowing any better, I bought it.  It doesn't even WORK with this model camera. I bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether

It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.

Do not buy this camera. 

It did take decent movies, and the size is nice

This is not the best way to get started in astronomy. 

The low power eyepiece is fairly useful, the higher power one less so, and don't even think of using the barlow.  The maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x, assuming the objective lens is of good quality. When you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope, you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown.  

To their credit, the manufacturer has provided a reflex "red dot" finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes.  

Even so, what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited.  Some star clusters will be dimly visible, but galaxies and nebulae will be barely--if at all--visible. 

In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.

Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.

For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.

This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:

1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  

2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  

3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  

4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.  

Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.

The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.

But of course  you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer.
The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash.  At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy.

I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily

I had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. After a lot of research, I settled on the Pro Tour Laser. 
As previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  I have a feeling this is true of all lasers. 
Even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car I found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present. 
On the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping. 
This unit has been returned and I have gone to a standard handheld GPS instead. Once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. I do this with a chart taped on the back of the GPS. Accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper. 
I am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles.

Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price

After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder. 

When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.

I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.

I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.

UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return)

Like other reviewers, after careful research, I decided to purchase this product. It was affordable, received good reviews, and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range. When I received it in mail, I was quite happy: it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what I had expected. The screen was bright and very attractive. 

The problems started about three weeks following the purchase. First, the slideshow option (the kind with music) stopped working. Whenever I pushed the slideshow button, the screen would completely freeze and I had to restart the unit in order to use any other function. I thought, no big deal, I would just exchange the frame for another one.

My second unit arrived yesterday. This one, however, started having problems right out of the box. After about 5 minutes into the slideshow, the screen started flickering, than shaking, became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically. I played it two more times after that, each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow.

It is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential (big, bright screen); unfortunately, the software is very buggy. I checked the Portable USA website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix. I will have to return this unit again, this time for a refund.

My assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box. However, I would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership

There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!

I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.

This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.

Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see

I bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos.  We promptly sent it back for a refund.  I would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor!

I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase

Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote.  Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine.  Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working.  Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?).  Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro?  Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files.  Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality.  E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback!  Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act

If I could, I would give this camcorder a 0 of 5. Since I now have to search for a new camcorder, from reading other Panasonic model reviews, I am convinced I did not just get a lemon, but the Panasonic brand is bad. 

We bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son. It has had problems from the beginning. First, I could not finalize the disk. I called Panasonic support, who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording. This is ridiculous since I often set the camera down on a countertop so I can be in the video. Then I finally got someone to tell me that I needed to be recording on Panasonic mini-DVDs. The best it has worked have been on the Panasonic DVDs which are some of the most expensive, and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the DVD after finalization. I still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch. It has skipped over whole sections. I have 3 DVD players in my home (all different brands) and the disk works on none of them.

I finally got an address to send it in for repairs. I was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time. I was told they would look at the camcorder, see if there was a problem and call me. I waited a week after I knew it was in the shop to check the status. Panasonic FAILED TO MENTION that I would need to pay $207.50 UP FRONT for them to look at it, then if any repairs were needed, this cost would cover them as well. SO, I have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing, and the company I sent it to has not even looked at it because I have not paid them! This is crazy since I can get a brand new miniDV camcorder for $225. 

The only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at Best Buy. So you see why I couldn't just take it back to the store (or I would have a long time ago)! Also after spending over $500 on this piece of junk, I could not afford to just replace it. Sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn, because I didn't want to miss any precious memories (which I ened up missing anyway!). So now the holidays are upon us, and I will be forced to purchase another camcorder, since I don't know if they will send it back to me in time for Christmas. I will not pay the $207.50 for a camera that hasn't worked well out of the box. I also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing!

Plus another thing, the still picture is bad quality. Very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it. We only used that function once. 

I have lost so many disks, and have so many others that only play part of the DVD that when I think of it I cry. I have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless. I wish I would have never bought this camcorder! IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS CAMCORDER TO CAPTURE MEMORIES, BUY ANOTHER! I will not buy Panasonic products again!

I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.  

Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.  

To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE

Cons only, no pros:
the velcro closure is week and opens easily
terrible look
the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless
no space for extra memory or battery
attaches only to a very small belt
the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash

Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.

I purchased this camera in December 2005 to replace my 7 year old Sony Digital 8 camcorder. Unfortunately, everything except size is inferior in the Panasonic compared to the "ancient" Sony.  The color is not nearly as sharp, the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long.  The sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself. The camera's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer's editing program.

The Panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other miniDV camcorders lack. This allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights. It uses a toggle to control the exposure and, while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the Sony, it is adequate.  Unfortunately, it functions so poorly in low light it wouldn't provide adequate color in an auditorium.

I thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the Panasonic than my old Sony. Maybe it's because the camera is so small it's hard to keep as stable as the larger Sony.

Video editing on a PC is equally easy on the Sony and Panasonic but the Panasonic's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with Sony's Digital 8. 

If you don't HAVE to record in miniDV format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera, I'd recommend buying an inexpensive Sony Digital8 for about a third of the price of the GS250. 

If you do have to have a miniDV camera and you won't be shooting in bright sunlight, try another brand.

This upper end 3CCD camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless I need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day. Otherwise, I'll use the old Sony so I can share the video I shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality

Try to call Panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first. Panasonic service is the worst one in this world.

Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality

I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all.  Overall don't waste your time and money

I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. 

I have now had 3 different brands of 8" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.

I have developed the following list of features in my "ideal" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.

Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3.
Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.
Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too.
Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)
Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.

Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. 

I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.

The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)

The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.

Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.

My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.

I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see

"lens error, restart camera" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. When I searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. I have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. I dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)

Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD "shattered." One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative.

I just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  But today I tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).  Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.  

Grrrrr!!

I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.

I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one.
The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for

I bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak Z700. I  loved my Z700, even though it was only 4MP and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. I figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6MP would be a no-brainer, but I was disappointed in 2 major areas. First, the lag time is so slow on the C653, when I took pictures of my kids I rarely got what I was expecting to see. The smile or look that I saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. We experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. The other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. Anything I shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. Every background was grainy. Terrible. Using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in "Sports" or "Kids" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the Z700 for taking pics of the kids). On my Z700 (which is only $150 now), I could set it and forget it. Set it to "action", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary. That's what I thought I was getting in the C653, but I was wrong. I ended up returning the camera

Grainy ISO 100 pictures at any light conditions. Usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem, but if you take pictures with Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera.

I had Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and the only cons. is really noisy high ISO sensitivity mode.

In FZ8 camera Panasonic implemented the Venus III processor (FZ7 has Venus II processor). As a result picture quality really improved at high ISO sensitivity modes but DRAMATICALLY changed for the WORSE in ISO 100 mode

I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.  I suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory.  If you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating.  It is also frustrating to discover Smith Victor does not have a support site (just references on photography).  They do not even provide a support # or address.  Keep all this in mind when considering something from this company

I bought this lens in May for my brand new Rebel XT. I used it on a vacation mainly, and am pretty dissapointed. I'm no pro, or even skilled amateur, but I do know the lens is not giving me quality shots.

The autofocusing is slow, and af or manual shots aren't very sharp at any zoom. There seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me.

I wanted a good, all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types. I guess this would fit the bill, if it took sharp pictures. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for this lens again

Me and my wife bought the JVC camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. At first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. We have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. We returned it to get another and it did the same thing. WE thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. I do not recommend this to anyone

I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called "red-eye reduction" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).

Not seeing many reviews, I'm writing this as a warning. This mic is horrible. I bought it to get rid of the &quot;motor noise&quot; from my Canon Optura Pi, as many others have. When I listen now, the sound is much worse. You can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... THIS MIC IS HORRIBLE

I bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera. The night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible. It snaps and pops all night long and I have to move it all around to find "just the right spot".I actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise. I live in a single story 2100 sq. foot house. I should have returned it right away, but I kept it because I had no other monitor at the time. Now, 10 months later, the volume control does not work anymore! I am now trying to find a new monitor. I love having the video monitor though, so I will look for a different brand

I received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something I had particularly wanted.  I was extremely disappointed when I found it didn't work at all!  There is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference.  We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. I swear it was supposed to have "night vision" - forget it, non-existent.  I'm off the video monitoring; I'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor

Because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. You have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. We have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. We went with Graco's excellent digital iMonitor.

Very dissappointed.  My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  Audio just static and noise.

I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work.  Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you.  This is the last I purchase equipment on-line.  I will stick to books thank you very much

This monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. We purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. However, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. We were still able to have audio recpetion. After 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. Not a good camera for long term

This camera has a very poor lens. At 1x zoom, the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous; try taking a picture of a tiled wall. Image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100%; scaled down on a computer monitor, the quality is OK. Color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance. [...]

Review:
Unit had a very large defect in the field of view. It's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube; those I am aware of as I have other night vision devices. This goes about 1/4 of the way across, near the center. Had to return it. Poor quality control.

Update - the new one does not have any image defects. It also doesn't focus as sharply as the first one did (or my other one does), but it isn't too bad

I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera

There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.
If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!

I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.

This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]

Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.

But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good.

In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??

The leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an SD card to stick onto it.  I have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but I decided not to chance it. I am surprised that Canon cautions against placing the camera in Strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature!

Although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse.

The neck strap is OK, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera.

The battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money

My Coolpix 8800 lapsed into "system error 2" mode within weeks of getting it.   After taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and I have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs.  Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help.   Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost...   The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price.  The controls are ridiculously complex.   The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk.  The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable... I wouldn't recommend this camera or any Nikon product to my worst enemy....Oh yeah, and they made the lens an oddball size so you have to buy overpriced Nikon filters for it....

I was down in Antarctica when I turned on the camera and it said "lens error". After a day of missing some of the best pictures of Emperor Penguins with my 8800, I twisted the lens and got it to work. The same thing happened to me in Bolivia, just after the warranty expired. I called Nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera. Do a Google search of "lens error" and Nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience. This is my third and last Nikon

This case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses, briefcases or luggage.  But don't count on it to protect your camera from falls, dirt or dust.

When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.  It seemed to become less effective each time I used it to the point that now I'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time.  It still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless.

If you're looking to capture "The Decisive Moment" with the Nikon Coolpix 8400, STOP---DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!! For that matter, carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture "action," because what you think you see,  may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image.
Let me briefly explain where I'm coming from: I made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years. By the time I retired out of the business I had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images. I owned and used mostly Nikon equipment all those years (although I sure liked working with Leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses), starting with the original Nikon F SLR (which I still have) and finishing up with the N90S and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths. I like Nikon equipment a lot.
I decided to begin working with digital images last year. I was attracted to the Coolpix 8400 because the "spread" on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm--85mm. When I worked with film I probably used my 24mm and 105mm Nikkors more than any others in my bag, so this little Coolpix beauty had just about what I was looking for in one package.
Let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism, it is, nevertheless, a marvel of human ingenuity. For many other uses---such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture (put another way, things that don't move), it works wonderfully well. 
Seriously, I shot an assignment here in Tucson that was essentially architectual in nature. The images can only be described as superb (if I do say so myself). I worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot. Working inside I simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 (which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days), did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter, etc. Point being that with film I often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate Gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment. Even then, I'd sweat blood until I could get the processed film on a light table. Of course with digital, I (you) don't have to worry about any of that stuff. One can check the image immediately and know instantly if you're good to go.
Alas, the shutter lag on this, and many other digital cameras made these days, is the "downcheck" which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. There is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with. The combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image, the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second. I have taken many good pictures of people working, "action" shots and the like, but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what I intended that I achieved my purpose. Essentially, my shooting eye (which is pretty damned good) had nothing to with it. It's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun---if he fires enough rounds, one of them is going to hit the other guy. Marksmanship has nothing to do with it.  Same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag. If you shoot enough images, statistically you're probably going to get a good one. But it's not a very good way to do things. 
So if you're looking to capture what Henri Cartier-Bresson (I'm not sure I've spelled his name correctly) so artfully described as "The Decisive Moment," look at a digital single-lens reflexes, or wait for improvements in digicams.

Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera.

The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot. 

The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.

The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.

After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt".

The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it

I was very happy with the previous model DSC-N1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. But this one, while I only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. The pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, I used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1MP! 

I'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible I will return it, I just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures. And after reading the previous review about the terrible Sony custmer servce, I decide I will avoid Sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.  

Note: Found the review by Cecelia Choy "cece" on March 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem I had. I didn't have this problem with my previous model DSC-N1. 

April 17, 2006: I bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! Suggestion for those having the same problem I had before -- exchange for another one!!

I ordered two of the items above in error.  I did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from Antonline.  I have been trying since Dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  I am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  I just wish I could get return labels and my account credited.  They are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  Thank you for being interested. I was informed by them that my time had expired.  I do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them.

When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion.

Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging

I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.  Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery.  The price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers

If you want a quality product, this ain't it.  The dreaded "Remove the Cassette" error is true and in full force.  Don't take my word for it, search the net and find the hundreds, upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way.  I highly suggest the Panasonic AG-DVX100.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it.

Before reading other reviews, make sure that they are comparing the GL-2 to another cam, like Tony L. Shores.  He compares the Canon GL-Piece-of-junk-2 to the Sony HDR-FX1.  Sure, the Sony is much better, but it is also a High-Definition cam.  If you want HD, check out the Panasonic AG-HVX200.

Do your research, read the reviews

I bought this over the Sony and I regret it.  I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind.  I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem

My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1.
I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.
The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony.
The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.
However, beware of the rebate offer.
I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.
The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code.
If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony

I bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. I have to say, I am greatly dissatisfied. Here are some main issues I am having with the camera:

1. It is very poorly designed. The look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. Buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..

2. The camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.

3. The worst, by far, is the picture quality. Colors are just plain terrible. Automatic settings are a disaster of photography. I have used a Canon (2MP) before getting this one (5MP). The Canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. I don't need large files of trash, I am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.

As a result, I am strongly recommending getting a different camera. I have had great experiences with Canon; and seems like Sony and Nikon are doind a good job too. But HP must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices.

This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again

I loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  I was using it one night and it died.  I went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  I would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.

I had an older Canon camcorder that I was very happy with, so I decided to get this new one. I ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. I even tried the same model at Best Buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. But compared to a similar Sony model, the Canon was noticeably louder while operating. Way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions

I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??)

The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'.

I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback.

In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be

I was attracted to the Cannon ZR800 due to the very small size and very low cost.  However, you get what you pay for, although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost.  I've already returned my Cannon ZR800 and replaced it with the Sony DCR-HC38.  The smallest problem with the Canon is the continued motor noise, which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the ZR800 predecessors.  The problem is that the motor is very loud, and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors.  This could be forgivable given the low cost, but the problem with the zoom noise is not.  When you zoom in and out, a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch.  It is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video.  It is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click.  It is annoying, unusual and a big flaw with these new ZR Cannon camcorders.  I called technical support, the person took a ZR800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist (she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring).  Bottom line, this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free.  Do not but it.

BTW, I love the Sony DCH-HC38 which is a bit more expensive and, like the ZR800, just recently came onto the market.

I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated "flipping" of the flash that some other users have reported.  The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called "Gadget Infinity" under the listing title of "Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature".  Buy it now price is $29.99.  I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier.  Pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years

This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.

I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.  

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.

This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.

This is another example of how Sony is alienating its customer base. Not only will it not work with standard SD memory like everyone else, it does not include a docking station.  You have to shell out more money for that option.  I dont think so

Pros: Great resolution. Nice packaging. Excellent door stop. 
Cons: Stopped working after 3 weeks. Horrible overall quality. No customer support what so ever since I didn't have a receipt (ebay purchase). 

Tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt, never got a response now I'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight.  Tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $199.  Becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products.

I can't say for sure that my experience was typical, but I can say that it was horrible.

The short version is:  I had to return it once for a screen failure, then I had to return the replacement for a screen failure (and a refund).

In between the returns, I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support.  The manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff.  I also had problems with Windows (Network Bridging, I think) that further complicated things.

For the brief time the two units worked, I was pleased.  The picture quality was good, and once running, I had no problems with the software.

I take a lot of digital photos.  This would have been the perfect compliment.

I gave the Memory Frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, I was pleased with the quality of the display.

Too bad I couldn't say the same about the quality control.

The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens.  So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out.  As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful.   I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.

Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight

I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.

But after three months the lens would not close.  It makes grinding noises,

The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems.  HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM.  Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment

Well. I was convinced the FX07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months. Like a lot of other reviews have pointed out, the noise level in low-light condition is annoying, and give you a watercolor-like effect. Some pictures I took during a visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium turned out completely dark (to prevent this beforehand, I even took photos of the same objects using several different settings, only to get the results of bad, worse, and worst). The picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old Sony cybershot T7. I was totally disappointed. If not for my T7 was broken, I wouldn't even wanna use this camera. Even re-sell it to other people, I would feel it's like a crime.

After revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews, I realized I must have got the defective item from Amazon. Well. What can I say? It's been 6 months. 

Bottom line: Just be careful when you received this item. Do some test shots. If anything looks suspicious, ask for a replacement. After all, all the high praise here can't be all wrong

I used to have an Canon Elura 70, which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer didn't work so I decided to replace it with the Elura 100 only to find that Canon had discontinued the Elura line. I really wanted an Elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models. So as a compromise I purchased the ZR 850 which has a 1MP CCD, not a good as the Elura (1.3MP) but better than the other ZR's (.640MP). The video quality wasn't bad but the motor noise was so loud I couldn't believe it. I returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad. This isn't a minor hum in the background I'm talking about, its a full-on whine! I also found the ZR camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing. Luckily I could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned Elura 100 that is much more satisfactory. Its a mystery to me how Canon can produce two markedly different cameras (quality wise) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one

I really like the size and weight of the camera.  It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead

I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it

My hunting buddy purchased a Nikon 800. My intent was to put him in the shade. That Nikon kicks the crap out of my Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000. Tried new batteries, tried bluffing, even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards.
My opinion is this product is not worth the postage.
Anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product. [...

I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product

HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!

I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.

so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like "um... is THAT it???" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... 

also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all... 

other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.

I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...

Hi, 

I have lost the CD rom to download the movie from the camera.

Sony does not offer it for free on its website. You have to pay $70 dollars to get it again.

That clearly disappoints me.

This camera is a decent enough camera, compact, easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent.  The battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour.  I acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so I never worry about running out of juice.  I have only two complaints really, one minor and one major. 

The minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen LCD viewfinder. I find I need to use my reading glasses to see what I'm doing.

The major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the iLink cable (not supplied).  I have never persuaded it to work.  By browsing various camera fora on the web I am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other Sony models.  The computer will recognize the camera in USB mode (for capturing still pictures from the memory stick) but does not see it at all when plugged in via iLink (firewire/IEEE 1394).  All indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly OK.  Sony tech support, both web chat based and phone, have no clue and because I am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it.   

If all you want to do is connect the camera to your TV to playback the video you take, it's a good camera.  If video capture an editing is what you have in mind, buyer beware. Because of this, I can only give the product 2 stars, other wise it would be a 5.

Update:  I installed a new Firewire PCI card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again.  I also tried the camera on my neighbor's Mac (on the theory that if a Mac won't recognize it you really know you have a problem).  The computer still won't recognize the camera.  This camera has been used very little and definitely not abused.  It was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem.  If you buy this, make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it.  Don't wait like I did because I'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed

I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low.

Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon

The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too

I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon

I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far.  This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one.  Now I have to buy another battery

Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality

I bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  I didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  As soon as it was turned on I had the following problems:

1) Five seconds after I turn it on, it always says "USB Connected!"-- and I don't have a USB cable inserted into it!  This also freezes the device.  I found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted.

2) I cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  My computer does recognize the USB device, but when I try to copy files over to the frame, I get a "path is not found" error.

3) I thought I could live with the above 2 problems if it could JUST SHOW MY PICTURES.  So I used a card reader to load .JPG files onto a CF card at 400x300 resolution. When, I plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as "Invalid" when I try to view them.

Emailed Coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying: 

"Coby Tech Support to me
5:25 am (3 hours ago) 

Hello,

I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all.  Overall don't waste your time and money

I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. 

I have now had 3 different brands of 8" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.

I have developed the following list of features in my "ideal" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.

Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3.
Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.
Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too.
Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)
Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.

Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. 

I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.

The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)

The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.

Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.

Be careful ordering this item - make sure it's the right one for your camera.  While it says it's for the A95, it isn't.  While it doesn't say in the header that it's the LA-DC52C, it is, and the A95 camera requires the LA-DC52D.  I had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one.  I purchased the wrong one based on amazon's direction when purchasing accessories and don't want others to make the same mistake

If you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. It is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (Or for a beginner in photography or a child.) You have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. Also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.

The only thing I like about this camera is it's size. It's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag...

Anyway, I'm buying a better one soon

We just bought this camera to replace our miniDV JVC-DVL500 that was bought in 2000. 

In short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is VERY grainy and dark. I applied the workaround listed above, but found that I had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that I needed which caused a VERY jittery image. 

The quality of this camera is something that I would expect for $200, needless to say I am returning this camera today

After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR.

I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. There is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. The zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so I don't recommend doing this. Look for a better case for your new camera.

I bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste.  The camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. Nothing is a simple "one step" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children.  I was so frustrated setting it up that I didn't bother giving it to her.  The software installed okay but was also far from "kid friendly".  I wish I would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. Ironically, the reviews I did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids.  I believe you'd be better off purchasing a "regular" inexpensive digital camera for your potential "shutterbugs".

my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back

At least if your going to decieve people about the LCD screen in the back, AT LEAST make the picture quality decent.  I mean this barely qualifies as a picture.  Some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light.  This was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when I had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures.  

Definatly stay away from this camera

This camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  After purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  The computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  It not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  The instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  Even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  Unfortunately, I have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to

First, I want to defend this camera's lack of an LCD viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point.

What's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it NEEDS to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button.

This product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  As it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is NOT intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and THEN you can take a picture.  Then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN!

Oh, and did I mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you MUST use the flash?

Clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  Heck, MY digital camera is easier to use than this!  We never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, I knew this was going back to the store ASAP

This was a waste of money.  My 5 year old loves taking photos.  She uses my digital camera  sometimes.    I  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  She could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  This was not the case.   The LCD does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. If the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. I think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  My daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months.
If your child  likes to take  photos, I would invest in something  else

Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE

I bought this bag looking at the display on amazon. But compare to price I paid this bag is not atall good. Size is small, extra pockets are useless, where you cant keep much. Camera pocket is also not convenient.

Only plus point is quality of material used.

I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called "red-eye reduction" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).

My hunting buddy purchased a Nikon 800. My intent was to put him in the shade. That Nikon kicks the crap out of my Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000. Tried new batteries, tried bluffing, even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards.
My opinion is this product is not worth the postage.

I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product

This microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the Sony HDR-HC7 video camera on most websites, including SonyStyle.  While the microphone may be of good quality (I didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the HDR-HC7.  The microphone does plug into the MIC jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (Note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  After nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a Sony Technician, I learned that there is a "jury-rigged" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  Otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  The Sony technician finally admitted that it was " curious" that Sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  If you have a Sony HDR-HC7, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MICROPHONE!

I ordered this mic after having to return the ECMHS1 (because it was, in reality, totally non-directional).  Well, this one actually IS directional, but it is such a pain to use I wish I never bought it.

1st of all, you should know this mic does not work with the "smart shoe" available on most Sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe.  Therefore it is battery powered.  This may seem like a minor problem, but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video, otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery.  Believe me, at some point you WILL forget this.

Not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it isn't in the way.  (In my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use.)

(As you might expect, I highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible.  Of course, that means the mic doesn't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe.  It's a great feature.)

Finally, while the engineers at Sony have done some amazing things over the years, they weren't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic's battery.  This cap will fall off with even the slightest touch.  This can be INCREDIBLY annoying.  Mine fell off several times - fortunately I always managed to find it.  I finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it (doesn't look great, but at least the color matches).

Considering the high cost, this mic is a really bad investment.  While the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic, this is a VERY poor substitute.

I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend

My husband bought me this camera for my birthday in May 2006.  I loved this camera.  Well, it stopped working on Christmas Eve.  I used it that morning with no problems, put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening.  When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures.
After talking with the customer service folks, I sent my camera in for repair.  It was under warranty, and I had not done anything to break the camera.  Well, they voided my warranty stating that it was "Impact Damage" and my repair bill was $111.00.  You have got to be kidding.  I called to question the voided warranty since I had not dropped the camera.  The technician I spoke to explained that "Impact Damage" could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse.  So I asked to speak to a manager.
I am sorry, but if I am going to spend this much money on a camera, I expect a little better quality.  I have called and email the Kodak Company several times to have someone talk to me.  Nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails.
I would SERIOUSLY think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera.  I have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it.

I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated. 

My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague!

Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon

The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too

I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon

I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.

It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.

Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month.

I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...

I received this as a Christmas present.  This digital camera works fine for still shots, pictures of my family, etc, but for action shots, kids playing outside, basketball games, etc. it is a BIG disappointment.  I took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping. I've taken to several games/activities to try it out. I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked.  Many of the shots are blurred, have shadows (because of movement), or are so dark the people can't be seen.  I wish I would have known this before I asked for this camera.

I got this lens in a kit with a Nikon D80 camera.  This lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time.  Why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this?  Its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it.  It was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length.  A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints.  Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm).  I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.  

If your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens.  If you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos, this lens is for you..

This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so 
that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical
to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens.
Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally a
responsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketing
this lens.  I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic
representative who took the matter up with "someone else".  The outcome was that
they admit that there "is very little increase" in the non-vignetted field of view
by using this adapter.  She said she would put my comments on a company-internal
problem compilation called "customer voice".  I can only hope it reaches someone
high enough to do some good

After receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera, I discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate.  For instance, you cannot access the CF card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount, Also, taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle.  This is not useable for a carry-around use.

I have it sitting in the corner of my office unused, spent good money for nothing.

Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. The Rebel XTi with the 17-70mm lens barely fits.

So a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this

This is a poorly designed camera case.  You have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures. I expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot. I was very disappointed. This is rather a leather box than a camera case

I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5.

I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.

However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: 
(1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called "red-eye reduction" setting does nothing.
(2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible.

These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above.

Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else.

Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).

Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon

The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.

The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. 

So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too

I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.

After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon

After discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case, I did some more looking.  What I ended up with was a Pelican case.  For those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop, and they most likely carry them.  They come in many sizes and are simply an airtight, waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches.  The inside is solid soft foam that you &quot;pluck&quot; to fit what ever you want to store in the case.  I purchased the 1300 for my Finepix 3800.  The case easily holds the camera, battery charger, mini tripod, and 3 XD cards.  They come in 4 or 5 colors, and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage

I was completely fooled.  Twice.  My fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for Christmas.  So as I slowly open the box, I see a pair of socks on top.  There was more underneath, so I start opening it further and there is a camera case, a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box, the HP Photosmart M525 Digital Camera!  I was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own.  No more borrowing from my sister when I needed to snap a few pictures.  I put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures.  To put it bluntly, UGH!!!  The first thing that I noticed is that, even in best picture mode, the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions.  The second thing that I noticed is that the pictures are distorted.  There's a slight fisheye effect (Imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door.) which is quite annoying.  I talked to HP Support (Someone who spoke very poor english I might add.  What is the deal with that?) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model.  Guess what?  Same problem!  So after talking to HP once again, I am returning this one and getting a different brand.  This is a horrible product. My sisters Kodak that I bought 3 years ago is a far superior product.  I am very disappointed.  HP needs to put out a better product, and have some customer support reps that speak better english.  It gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood

As an owner of the Sony DCR-HC30 model DV Handicam, I want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  Design and feature-wise, these Handicams are great.  The problem is, they are built like junk.

From the day I opened my box, I got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  In retrospect, I should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  But being a basically optimistic guy, I decided it just got dirty in transit, and I got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  It worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in Sony's crappy labor warranty.  And from that point forward, I have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist.

I often get bars across the screen during playback, and I have already determined that I have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  Sony's solution to this situation is their standard "flat rate" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what I paid for the camera in the first place.

And Sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? They are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.  Guess I'll be buying Samsungs or Canons next time around.

Are you listening, Sony?

There is currently a known issue with many of the Sony Camcorders.  This is being called the "black screen of death".

What happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the CCD goes out like a light.  The camera will not take video again.

Sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support.  The fact is Sony does not stand behind their product.  If this happens to you, Sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.

There is a lengthy thread on CNET on this issue.  Search for Sony black screen.

Wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not Sony) video camera,
Scot

If you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos.

It does work well for video. The Sanyo Xacti HD1A camera itself is a disappointment

I have had this camera for about a year.  It has been nothing but a problem.  First, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  I have spent HOURS trying to fix it.  Still has bugs in it no matter what I do. 

Secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  How do I explain the problems I have had?  There are so many.  The camera misfunctions continuously.  Sometimes it does nothing at all.  Other times the zoom lense will not shut.  You turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  I sometimes can not even shut the camera off I gotta take the batteries out to do so...if I can even find batteries that work in the camera.

Honestly, I call tech supoport and told them the problems I have having and they tell me that only Kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  SO I went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  The camera salesman told me that Kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  I believe him.  So my camera which would not work...I asked the salesman to help me out.  It did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. He popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  Well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  My camera now does not work with either batteries.  Probably only Kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe Kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me.

I personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  Really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  I am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know I gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  Trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  STAY AWAY FROM KODAK CAMERAS!  If you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews.

I bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  Money thrown away!!  The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked

We never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new.  And one day, the lens just won't open.  It lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically.  Called a up a Kodak Service center and they gave me a quote for repair.

The price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in Amazon!

I'll never buy a Kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs.  I do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point.  So I'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.

I think Kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera

I made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely. The lens is for a variety of Canon cameras but the adapter only works with the A6XX series. My adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.

Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting. This lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. If you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. If you stay zoomed in, it works ok. Disappointing

I bought this lens for my Canon PowerShot G5, and because it requires the use of a long adapter, not only does it cause terrible vignetting (that circle the other poster thought was cool, but which is actually a design flaw) unless you zoom most of the way, it blocks the built-in flash. I have owned four Canon cameras over the past 15 years, and the G5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (I would have bought the digital Rebel when it first came out so I could use my EOS lenses, but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).)

I do not recommend this lens or any of the G-series digital cameras from Canon. When I've got the money I'll be buying the latest digital Rebel and upgrading some of my old EOS lenses, and selling my entire PowerShot kit. If you are an experienced photographer, you will not like this system at all

I don't know what case others got, some have said "too tight" but mine was very loose. The camera is swimming around in the case, easily half a centimeter of clearance. Not recommended. Just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case.

Rated one star for the lack of value. 

You can buy the same Canon brand case for under $14 and a higher capacity, IMHO better, albeit non name brand, 1200mAh battery for under $10 from Amazon.  The neck strap is not worth the difference.

I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price.

I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less.

I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price

This was my second camcorder- after a Canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise. This Panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 MONTHS ( well, 3 months and a week- thereby a week too late for the warranty and a "too bad, so sad" response from panasonic!). I had used it to film a wedding- it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan. Do not buy this camera

I have one and Panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. The proprietary video format requires special handling in your PC and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips.  Are they abandoning this product? Look on the Panasonic website and see for yourself

While the Everio will work on a Mac, it is with JVC's movie program.  It is not iMovie ready.  There is a very strange "work around" involving DVDrop that will make it work.  Not very pleased with what I feel is misleading information about compatibility with Mac

I agree with the many other users who have experienced the "Condensation, Operation Paused" defect on their JVC GR-xxxx. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.

I bought this to replace my broken Digital8 Sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the Sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this JVC, on one single criterion: the near-infinite hard disk drive storage. This was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled.

Summary: infinite recording time, disappointing image quality and control for the price, painful editing. Not for the average iMovie user.

Positive points:
- the storage capacity: a dream. I thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation. Actually it took me months to fill them. Mostly because, as with digital cameras, you can throw away all the bad takes at will. I decided I'd keep all my previous good takes until I really would need the space, well... I still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder, which means that I can always show them at friends and family on location, even if I don't have my computer or DVD copies on me.
- the size, weight and shape: perfect. You can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions. It's small, feels rather rugged. I added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery, which makes the camera 50% bulkier but still manageable. The shape is great, at least for my hand size. I can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness... The microphones are not that well placed though, and I often cover them with my fingers.
- image stabilization: very good. By chance I shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way, which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness.
- ease of connection: the USB2 link is OK. I'd have preferred firewire, but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files. BTW, this allows faster-than-real-time transfer. A firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great...

OK points: user interface, reaction time (even if it takes a long time to get ready), optics, battery life (with the 3 hour batt. - actually a 1.5 hours).

Negative points :
- Image quality: considering the price, image quality is disappointing. Frankly. The viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low, and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as I found out after shooting for a whole week in Yucatan. Clips shot on my digital camera (Canon IXUS 60)  look better. There is also a lack of control on image quality.
- Digital camera: simply forget it. My phone takes better pictures. I'd advise you to buy a 2Mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals.
- File transfer and editing: pretty horrible with the originally supplied software. In marketing copy, MPEG2 files might seem nice as a target format, but we always have to edit our videos, and this is quite painful, whatever power-users might tell you. You are in for hours of conversion, except if you burn your raw takes, at the risk of boring your audience.

I was going to write "don't buy this if you are a Mac user". This is NOT iMovie ready. I have both PCs and Macs, it's equally painful and disappointing, except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite.

Still, if you have a Mac and an Everio get yourself the wonderful MPEG Streamclip free utility from Squared 5. It allows batch conversion of the Everio .MOD files into useable formats. You'll have to buy the MPEG2 component from Apple first and change the .MOD extensions to .MPG prior to conversions. Time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it, as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the JVC-supplied software.

Neat thing: leave your computer at home
Though you can't use the camcorder as an external hard disk (it is write-protected) you can copy the photographs from the SD card to the hard-disk, which means that with the Everio, you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera.

Conclusion: given the choice, I won't buy this camcorder, mainly for the below-par image quality, as I'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing. But I'd seriously miss the storage capacity

It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them

The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck

I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!

Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones

If you are going to lay out $500 for a camera, you should expect a fair amount of camera.

However, I have a few gripes here.  First, there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough.  All the Nikons in the D series can use a wireless remote.  You can buy an underwater case for those magnificent Nikons so you can shoot underwater.  You can get over 10 megapixels in a D80, or D200 and you get that great Nikkor lens.  You don't get much of a lens on the DC500, and 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images.  Lets face it: this is an expensive point-n-shoot camera for a tourist, not a serious camera.

Nuff said.

The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck

Sure my Canon sd-30 is super cute and I get lots of compliments on how small and sexy it is, but heaven forbid you want to take pictures with it!!

This camera cannot take pictures in low light AT ALL!  Every picture I've taken at parties has been out of focus, which adds up to a lot of hazy photos of great memories.  I took it back to the camera shop and the guy said I had the setting right but "yeah, they don't work well in low light."  Well if I needed a bright sunny day for every shot I could make a pinhole camera out of a cardboard box!

The pictures it takes in daylight are nice.  But anyone who wants a tiny little camera like this is planning on putting it in their pocket and taking it to parties!

I got the Sony Cybershot 10.1 and it takes GREAT pictures in low light.   Later, Canon.

If you like to take pictures with macro lense, it sucks. I've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality. If you get closer than five inches, the pictures messes up.
I've had no other problem with the hardware, though I hate carrying around that dock and it's odd shaped charger. No other charger cable in the world is going to fit! So loose it and you're screwed.
oh, and night photos also suck. BIG TIME, even with the flash on

Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not  hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed

This camcorder is terrible in just about every way:

Cons:
- Unacceptably blurry video; the specs say it records at 640x480, but it looks more like 320x240 (if that!) blown up to VGA.
- Noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background.
- Awful light sensitivity; forget about recording indoors--no matter how brightly the room is lit, faces will come out too dark.  The built-in LED's don't help much (and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject).
- Noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone.
- Zooming goes in irregular steps--completely useless while recording.
- Video lags noticeably behind camera movement; when image stabilization is turned on, the lag becomes so atrocious that you can't tell when to stop panning--UTTERLY USELESS!
- When using AV-in and AV-out cables, the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery.
- Video encoding (through the AV-in cable) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result.
- The LCD display has a very narrow viewing angle; anything more than about 10% and you can't make out a thing.
- Still photos taken at the native 5MP resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven--something like a "sharpen" effect gone wrong.  I can get better looking pictures with my 2MP Canon Powershot A40 camera.
- The manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds AFTER snapping a picture (that's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus BEFORE it snaps); but you can't keep THE SUBJECT from moving, folks!  Welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails...
- Flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background.
- The manual is a sorry affair--only 17 pages long and doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options.
- I could go on and on, but I'll stop now, as you probably get the picture...

Pros:
- The camera body seems sturdily built; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them, as do the battery and the USB port covers.  Hmm... it's the only nice thing I can think to say about it.

Maybe a child (think pre-teen) could find this "camcorder" exciting as a toy, but I don't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life's moments on video

Poor focus, blurry, awful optics. Don't waste your time with this one! Can't compare to the little PURE DIGITAL camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features.
