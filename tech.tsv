This is perfect for my iPod and keeps it totally secure while driving.  Great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly. 	1
As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio.  Total waste of money	0
Always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year	1
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous	0
I used it in Brasil and had it developed.  I was very happy with it.  It was the very first time I've used a digital camera	1
Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!	0
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again	1

Very pleased w/item.  Compact.  Easy to move from place to place	1
This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.	1

Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one	0
The cheapest option I found at the time but an excelent pen drive. Small and with a good style	1
I thought when I up graded to the plasma things couldn't get any better I was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top I love this thin	1
This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 	1
I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row.  I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks. 	0
Works like a charm, the Wi-Fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! You can get details of the connection i.e. connection strength, AP name and etc. Worth every penny 	1
I purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem. I use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far. Highly recommend this product	1

These boxes are half the size of regular cases, just right--not too bulky like the regular ones	1
This device is great for carriying around with your camera, you can review and share the pictures with any PC with USB available, data can also be recorded and easily recovered.	1
These batteries have been awesome.  My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs.  Flash recharge is very quick.  Highly recommended	1

"Wasted my money for this SLOW hub...
Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again"	0
What else do you need to know? You plug in your PCs and a cable to your router - and go. I used a Netgear hub for years. Replaced it with this Linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately	1
The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways	1
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.	0
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money	0
The CF card works fine but it's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32MB CF card came with my Canon Powershot A95. I got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their hasn't been any problems.	1
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them.  On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well	0
They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you	0
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement.  of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it.	0
Muy pero muy bueno, es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira	1
N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product.  Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight	0

Just remember to use the proper cable, Cat 5e or Cat 6	1
How can  you go wrong with a price so low. They're good for both parents and kids to use. Not to mention they're easy for young kids to operate! Keep in touch	1
"Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.

There may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever"	1
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.	0
FYI: This does not fit the new generation 5.5 of ipods (80 GB). Another thing is that there isn't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd	0
After about 3 weeks of operation, the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy.  Looking for a better option	0
Not much to say here.  It works.  Easily adjustable with just your feet.  Feels good wearing socks	1
Range is very weak probably less than half a mile. Don't waste your money	0
This works perfectly, and it is built very well.  My picture looks great and sound is also great	1

This performs better than the unit offered at the Apple store at about 20% of the cost! Plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel. Good deal	1
Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world.  It's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot.  Mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..	0
This product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly... A+++++ seller!  Will definately buy from again	1
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th.   I wouldn't waste my time ordering this product from Amazon	0

Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment	1
I have not been able to get this to work again. It was great for the first week, then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again. I am not sure I like that	0
"Great Price! Cant compare it to the more expensive ""monster cables"" but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components"	1
For its price and definately for its length, its an awesome alternative to it's $100 monster counterpart	1
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor.  Buying this handheld was a big mistake	0
"I purchased three of these for three Kodak easyshare cameras

Well-made hard case that is virtually a necessity to protect the Tungsten E2 which comes with a flimsy, cheap flip case	1

This memory card has not given us any trouble.  Very reliable product.  Highly recommend	1
Plenty of room for our HPA612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her HPA617.  Pockets for extra paper.  Shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer. 	1

"Although the RS receiver doesn't have TV reception (who cares),
it is 1/2 the price, PLL digital, 3"" speaker, DX/LOC switch, and
probably much better quality.."	0
A great product - snug fit on the laptop, and appears to be a part of the laptop itself. Difficult to remove, but no real reason to remove it anyway.	1
"The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear ""window"" to protect the screen"	0
This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	0
"Overall this item works as expected, but requires to be reset (i.e. cycle the power) once every 24-48 hours.
