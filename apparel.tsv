GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS	1
These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool..	1
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right	1
I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.	0
A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.	0
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :	1
THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone	0
Your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks!  I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered	1
IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it	0
Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say	1
The shirts are what I had asked for.  They are sturdy and well made.  I would buy more if I needed more.  Well worth the money spen	1

It's golden color is very remarkable ..It looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have	1
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied	1
Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers.  Relegated to cleaning after just one use	0

Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place	1
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve	1
Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers.  Relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
Awesome shoes. Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless. I'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously, and who likes to look even cooler when doing it.	1
I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free	0
I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.	0
A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.	0
This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow.	1
The sheets were just as described and worth the price. Timely on shippng also. Very pleased	1
The Crib sheets were soft, the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress	1
Haven't worn it yet to test the quality however, the structure is all wrong. One leg is more narrow than than the other (I could barely fit my leg into it) and the waist is really high	0
Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced	1
Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong.  Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response	0
Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things, and they are working great!  Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected! Thanks!	1
The shoes are better then expected.. Everyone comments on how nice they are and where did you get them.. I will let anyone know to buy the	1
I received the trousers in a timely manner.  They were what i expected although they did not fit.  I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company. 	0
Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.	1
"BEWARE..............This is a ""little"" girls camisole, and CHEAP looking"	0
"Look closely at the picture of the ""white"" top.  It actually has red around the top and on the straps.  To those of us who don't want ugly red zig-zag thread......."	0
Shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel.  I love Clark's, but not this pair	0
Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent.	1
This shirt was larger than I expected.  I got a 2x because i'm a 12-14, but it was way too big.  Also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured	0
I was very pleased with the socks.  They were just what we were looking for!  Thanks so much	1
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN	0
i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items	1
The shoes weren't the color that I wanted them to be. To me, there cheap and are over priced! The quality is not good. They can easily be scuffed. Am definitely returning them!!	0
"it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length.  ya who.

These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? 	0
The slippers are great!  They do seem to be on the large side of a 15.  My husband had to put paper in the toes.  He wears 15 in every thing else	1
I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit.  My little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! Thanks so much !	1
I never received this item when I was promised it, so it was cancelled and my account was credited	0
Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl	1
Not the best fabric, Scratchy and See thru. You get what you pay for on these	0
One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn.  I own several, and they're just about all I'll wear!  Very nice fit, and good look under clothes	1
I got this jacket last week, I liked it for the price i paid	1
Single Style, good shoes. I think is a nice choice to every day work	1
SHOES WAS NOT EXCALTY THE SAME AS PIC SHOWN ON WEB SITE IT WAS KIND OF USED..	0
They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash	1
I actually had to send this back cause of the size.  They run really small. 	0
I LOVE these shoes...I have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. I also love the price	1
Very poor quality, falling apart at the seams. Also really long.	0
The fit is great. Sexy slim look and feel. Slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim. Got lots of compliments	1
the price for the slippers was average- no big discount, but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas. That was a big plus. And my daughter loved them	1
this adapter nearly caught fire the first time I used it. watch out	0
Very cute tops, for a nice price.  They wash up good.  They do run a little big, just so you are aware	1
So cheap, the seams weren't sewn up all the way.  Am returning	0
The beading on the bag is fantastic, and its very cute.  The color is even more exquisite in person.  It's just big enough to hold ID, a little money, and a lipstick, perfect for going out at night	1
my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present	1
THIS HAS BEEN THE COMPLAINT OF OTHERS I SEE, BUT THERE IS NO SIZING INFORMATION FOR THIS PRODUCT AND CONSEQUENTLY I CANNOT PURCHASE AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING	0
They are perfect for kids daily lunches.  Would like to order more but don't where to start. Lost all the ordering information	1
Get EE if you get these.  The D is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable	0
"The tie does have gorgeous color to it, but when the description says ""good quality"" its a little off base. "	0
My son loved these jeans.  The jeans were very comfortable. The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect	1
It didn't meet my expectations.....It was flimsy and wrinkled, and looked messy	0
"Good quality workmanship, very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit. 

I would buy another one.

Soft, durable, breathable fabric.  Perfectly flexible for vigorous practice.  I'm glad I bought these	1
I ordered two bras and both were defective. The left side strap had been sewn twisted and there was no way to correct without cutting and resewing	0
THE BOOT IS GREAT BUT IT DOES RUN A WEE BIT LARGE, IF BETWEEN SIZES, GO DOWN NOT UP IF YOU WANT A CLOSER TO REAL FIT. THEY ARE FUN AND DO THE JOB WELL	1
Beware, this item is NOT a zip front hoodie as the item description says. It is a pullover!	0
The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy. I think it is real good	1
These are very cute and they fit great.  I wear them all the time	1
ordering was easy, arrived in 4 days, gloves fit, well and good quality, good buy,recommend  to purchas	1

I have to say, those crocs are the best. they are super confi, and light... I recommend them	1
     These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift, walking on concrete floors	1
Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund	0
Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available.  Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back.  Bad experience	0
I never seem to have luck shopping for bras, so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read.  They were a great deal and a wonderful fit.  I would highly recommend	1
I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it. 	0
I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.	0
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica	1
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!	1
Highly recommend shoe, BUT you might need a larger size than usual. I wear Easy Spirit 7 1/2 W but found this shoe too snug in both width and length, and had to return	1
Also, item shipped is not item pictured	0
These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em.Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots.  These shoes are very comfortable	1
The presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable, comfortable and goodlooking	1
I just got my pair of sandals.I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying. Although very cute and trendy sandles, but are very uncomfortable	0
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN PUCHASING FOR 15 PLUS YEARS. CAN I ORDER MONOGRAMED SHIRTS FROM THIS SITE	1
This is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe. The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow. If you are going for looks only...they are good. If you want any kind of foot comfort...skip it	0
I gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them, she says they are really confortable, and i find them really pretty. A really good buy it is	1
"Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't ""hand wash only""."	1
I LOVE THE STYLE, FABRIC, FIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE (BUT IT IS A T-SHIRT) I'M 5'2 AND IT DOESN'T COME PAST MY HIPS	0
The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night	0
the material is nice, but the size is too small.  I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee, the sleeve is too short	0
recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials	1
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them	0
these are the most warm and comfortable slippers.  i would recommend these to everyone	1
can't believe how true to size they are. They're quite easy to move in, and they're simple and beautiful. Not at all cheap-looking for the price. I expected less and got more	1
"I wish there was a rating of ""0"".  This was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided.   The armband cut through and tore the back completely off.   I am returning it"	0
"This wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from Brazil.
Maybe is good for another country`s document"	0
I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter	1
The jersey of our #54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy.(With the jersey NOT Grossman	1
It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it	0
These shoes are so comfy!  I love the no shoe string thing too.  Easy and comfortable.  What more could you ask for	1
Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $20 to return/exchange	0
The Lilyette Maximum Support bra is well made and wears well.  It holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features.  It is comfortable	1

I love naughty monkey! I'm so happy with their shoes! They don't hurt my feet	1

Good quality jeans at an affordable price. Size is just right, quite comfortable	1

I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price	1
The slippers were perfect, exactly what I wanted.  The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do. Thank You very much	1
Great slippers, very comfortable. I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure.  And the black ones are perfect because they don't show dirt like the white ones	1
Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head. 	1
i didn't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don't like it it's feels it's for old ladies	0
Very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed	1
I LOVE my new Steve Maddens!  They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly	1
This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable	1
They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again	1
My mother loves these pants.  I know they are for men, but she loves the way they fit her.  They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better. 	1
This bra is definately not for the over B cup set. The openings are too big and you'd be better off wearing nothin	0
It has a very loose fit and I feel a little silly, but pulling it out of the package I totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me. It is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly	0
I like the flip case. It is exactly what i wanted. However,the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it.	1

"The garment I received was labeled large.  In fact, at best it is a ""small"". The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled"	0
Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	1
The tape didn't stick well - plus the packaging was misleading, the box said it contained 2 bras (which you really need when the tape on the first one fails, you can try the second).  I threw it away	0
For the money, these are a great value.  Unlike a comment above, I have not found these short at all, but average in length	1
"love these little gems... perfect at 1 size below normal size.
you won't want to take them off"	1
I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point I can no longer wear it.  Bummer after just wearing it once	0
I really like these.  I do recommend getting a size smaller. I normally wear and 8.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly. super comfortable!	1
I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade	0
I love this jacket.   It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather.  It is also long enough to cover my rear.  Very good in the rain, too	1
My boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in New Mexico and I have looked everywhere for them.  I gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates	1
"it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell... 

cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it."	0
Was not the same boot from the pictures. Got very sad when opend my packet	0
The writing was peeling off this badly.  I can't let me child wear this.  I threw it out	0
I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited. I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time	0
This luggage did not last for even one flight.  It was torn in the corners and the handles were broken.  I did contact the company and was given a full refund though	0
I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great. 	1
Am I the only one sick and tired of this t-shirt???? Give it a rest already!! I can't browse without seeing it, the dead horse is beaten to oblivion!!	0
i have purchased other hats from well known companies. these hats are great for the money and are constructed well. good job!	1
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended	1
The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months.  The bag is now basically unusable.	0
These sweatpants are extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...Definetly a great buy..	1
"I found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great.
I recommend this for anyone looking for great bag, especially as a gift"	1
I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money	0
i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes..!!	1
I am very happy with my velour slippers .They are a perfect fit and very comfortable.I received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future	1
The shirt came fast.It's a good quality shirt.I'm satisfied with it	1
This is great.  I measured before I put it on & after.  I lost over 2 inches.  I highly recommend this	1
"You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!!
I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ......"	0
I really like this case, it fits so perfectly that the Zen doesn't rattle around or anything, yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible.  Easy to get on and off, too, and looks great	1
"I ordered ""classic"" jockey breif, which I currently own, but the new units received are approximately 2"" taller on each side when compared to my current briefs, both labeled Jockey Classic.

It is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys...instead of me carrying them!!!	1
This is a Great Gown for the price. It's comfy, soft, and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. Moreover, it's sexy! Hope yall enjoy	1
The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes.	0

These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking.  They are comfortable and a great buy.  A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe	1
The service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly.  Just what I expected and wanted	1
Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it.	0
This is the fifth pair of Club Cs I've owned, the second in black. I believe they're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market. I'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out	1
The sound works but the light does not	0
Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.	0
Love them.  They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes, and give the right support when doing a lot of walking, but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes	1
Purchased this for my son. He loves wearing it (he's a big fan of ny and the pd). Fits well, washes well	1
i ordered this buckle, the one shown in the pictures, and i received a different buckle, a red white and blue confederate flag, not the knife/buckle	0
excellent product for the price  a lot cheaper than the bridal shop  fast shipping  thank	1
Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for?  My husband was very pleased	1
This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture. Loose threads on it. Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift.  I wouldn't recommend this item.  It definitely cost more than it was worth	0
GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.	1
Reef makes the best sandals, the price is pretty much set, no real savings here, but the selection is great.  They may look like other sandals, but don't be fooled... They're TOP NOTCH	1
I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on.  The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible	0
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)	1
Size was true. I just did not like the	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
These boots look good with jeans. Can be loose, but comfortable with thick socks	1
This bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra's I've tried.  It's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin.  I would not recommend it	0
This was inexpensive, attractive, excellent windbreaker. Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip. 	1
I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase	1
I am very pleased with the soft briefcase I purchased.  It is so much easier to handle than a hard one.   I would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if I need something else	1
this bra was a terrible waste of money. the wire on one side stabs me constantly. the other side is fine. it's obviously defective.	0
Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe	1
I am very happy with this product, its comfortable and good looking. Worth buy...	1
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!	1
Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable, rubbery, poor traction giving and painful sole.  I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper	0
There aren't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team, as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time. Red Sox hats, however, are just such an item. Go Sox	1
I love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already! Can I send them back	0
These pants are fine if you have a very short rise, but I can't imagine that they would fit most people. I will be returning my order	0
these panties fit great wash after wash. great quality and very smooth under dress or pant	1
"For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic ""torpedo"" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable. "	0
This is one of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned.  Excellent quality and fit. 	1
My 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys!  Great product and very well made.  Can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter	1
Tan color looks very synthetic, cheapens look of shoe.  Also very wide fitting	0
My son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse	1
You'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult. Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me	0
didn't like these.  infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o	0
i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print. what is the status of my exchange? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products, they are great	1

"they were slightly small and a tad too stiff.

but very cut"	1
after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it.	1
These are paper thin cotton and feel rough.  They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate!  A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan	0
I was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats	1
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN!	0
I really wanted to like these, but they just won't stay put.  It's not a thong, but it will be after a few hours of wear.  I usually love DKNY products, so I am disappointed	0
The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was.  My son exchanged it	0
When I bought these shoes I didn't know they would look so pretty. I am glad I bought these shoes	1

I bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife, my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match, I'm really pissed off, if you gonna buy this piece of junk, beware with the size	0
Got this for my father.  He loves it.  Great coverage.  Easy to use	1
Great pants. I bought these in a variety of colors and I am very satisfied	1
The leather was good quality.  The wallet was well constructed.  I gave it as a gift and it turned out better than I it looked on the internet.  Grade A product	1
"This is very cheaply made, from very poor quality fabric.

The styling is not good, and the fit is poor.It does not resemble the photgraph.

I would pay ( at most) $ 5.00 for this dress"	0
These t-shirts fit on the small side, for women (not Juniors) but are soft, comfortable, and well made.  I have bought 4	1
"TERRIBLE BRA.  WHAT I MISTAKE I MADE THINKING THIS WOULD WORK OUT FOR ME.

TERRIBLE FIT, NOT MADE FOR DD CUPS OR FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE OVER A B CUP....

VERY DISAPPOINTED...."	0
I didn't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality. It already came with a loose thread. But it fits good. 	0
Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality	0
Boots are warm & Cozy. However, the color was much lighter than pictured...not the end of the world. Also, the shipping took longer than expected	1
it took a week and two days for my pants to arrive, i bought another item from amazon the same day and it arrived in three days. My experience with this company's shipping wasn't good	0
Reliable brand of work pants in a good selection of colors is all we're asking for	1
This is very comfy and pretty and a great price . Try it you will be sold. I am glad I did	1
"This product is really GREAT for this Sansa e260 I purchased. Strongly recommend it this Mp3 player. It helps grip, bottons work better, and looks ""cool"""	1
While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag, the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack	0
I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding.  It arrived quickly, looked great, and was an awesome price.  It would be hard to beat this great deal	1
This shoe looked nice and stylish, but turned out to be very narrow (even though I've ordered it in size wide!!!) and uncomfortable.  Also had some glue marks on it--I had to return it	0
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper	1
These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine, are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking.  It's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate.	1
I own this halter top in black & white.  The colors are vibrant & the fabric quality is very good.  This style runs small, so order 1 size up for a comfy fit. This company's customer service rocks	1
my fav shoes- I can wear them to dress up or to dress down... the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to	1
I've been buying these sandals for 30 years.  I just love them	1
Product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i	0
Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.  	1
this case is really nice and compact. there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside. is snuggly fits the HP digital camera. protects well. and well padded. very nice case	1
I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived. They appear used and have a small stain on them. As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again. Lesson learned	0
I love this Laptop Tote. It's big enough & ready to take to the pool	1
Sadly, this well designed item doesn't work for me.   It comes detached from its clip while I'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off	0
nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash	1
They are a great quality, comfortable boot. And the price was far less than local stores. The shipping at regular rate took over a week, though	1
"Got the jacket.  65% Wool, 25% Nylon and 10% Recycled Cashmere.  When they say Plus Size they mean it's the ""W"" size"	0
The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase agai	0
I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer.  Comfy & perfect for elliptical trainer, stationery bike and weight room.  Very stylish, I love Skechers footwear	1
I had to send this item back because it was to small.  The sizes run small, so beware	0
IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU, YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE, LOTS OF ROOM! I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY	1
"i never recieved the product.
the order was cancelled by the sende"	0
The pajamas are way to long.  They look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall	0
This item was just what I was looking for.  I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband's ties or a tie bar.  It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving. 	1
Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much	1
The product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product	1
Great product, works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description....Thank	1
I bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is.  i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back.  Very rude	0
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon	1
They are awesome, only tricky part is making sure you get the right size, my husband and I love them	1
This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck. It is light and drapes well. But it is too light for printing.	0
I purchased this as a gift for a teenager.  She told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper.  It is being returned	0
I can't imagine who could pull off these clown pants. They're unwearable!  What was Hanes thinking?	0
The product was not quite what I expected, but I got a quick return to my satisfaction.  Happy shopping	0
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank	1
it's comfortable and stays in place all day. it's wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day. I am so glad I bought it, and it I got it delivered fast!	1
"I love this case. I purchased many cases before, but this offers the best protection at a very low price.
Thanks. CoverCas"	1
i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like	0
this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall	1
this device didnt work properly at all, i lost my money on this purchase.sorry, but that's how i feel	0
Great cap.. quality is top notch.. Price is also great.	1
I love the color and the flexibility of the material. It doesn't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection	0
I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets.  He LOVES everything about it - especially the fact that it is the Bears!  =	1
I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing	0
Better than just a beach tote, sturdy bag for any occasion, good price	1
"I'm very happy with this tote bag. It's huge and sturdy. 

I've been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking. Quite a number of my colleagues like it, too"	1
This light worked for one day. I should have known better because in the past, I bought a tap light, and it worked for only a few days, too. Don't waste your money	0
"I have a small head and it makes it look huge!

Maybe if i had a big head it would look alright  pfff"	0
My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas.  He said that they were warm and soft	1
This bag is great!  Very fashionable and protective of my laptop.  Great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones	1
Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price. 	0
"Been purchased many pairs Keds shoes, 
very stylest and comfortable.
Me and my mom love them"	1
The webbing was abundant and easy to cut to my needed length. These belts can be made to fit anyone	1
Love the shirt!  This was a birthday present for my son.  We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again	1
Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better	0
It is a comfortable little t-shirt dress for 9 bucks.  Be careful because the sizes run small.  If you get it, buy a size larger than you normally would	0
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes	1
The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use.  I won't recommend it to anyone	0
for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe	0
Very quick delivery.  Price was very good compared to other online companies.  Will use again	1
This bra is very comfy and also quite sexy for a sports bra!  I am a b cup and am using it for low to moderate impact activities and have found it quite supportive and comfortable	1
bad shoe for sure. it is not for running. but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work. this may d	0
They looks nice, and fit really well, however, not so soft like some other Clarks/Indigo. 	1
Fits, Great quality,great sale price- If your lucky you don't get what you pay for	1

The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side	1
"The shoes are true to size and very comfortable. But only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate. 
Really expected a better quality."	0
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!	1
Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use.	0
 My husband bought me these for Christmas and I have had more compliments on these!! The flare styling and laces set them off 	1
They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times!  I expected more having paid nearly $20 for a pair of slippers.  VERY dissapointed	0
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you	1
after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen	0
I didn't purchase this shoe. I ordered two pairs of another Dr. Scholl's that day.You must have an error in the records	0
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected	1
This item is not 100% cotton.  Rather, it is 100% polyester	0
I actually purchased the Silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend. He loves and it was much cheaper than the one Creative offers on their website.	1
We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk.  Rather stiff and uncomfortable	0
I LOVE these shoes!!!!!they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price.i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase	1
"Very nice feeling robe and fit well.  Although I only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone.

My wife is now making me one instead"	0
Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy	1
"I purchased this expecting a high quality Satin robe, but what I received was a run of the mil polyester robe. Yes, it is shiny, but it feel like plastic.

Sadly, this will be returned"	0
Originally ordered a COMPLETELY different model armband for 15 bux. GOT THIS ONE......we'll see if my 80 gb video will fit.....doubt it....AMAZON....bad call on this seller son!!!	0
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want	1
This is a cheap and flimsy armband.  NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.  There are much better on Amazon for less money	0
I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer	0
I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress. This scarf was perfect. It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap. Very pretty	1
If you like cheap furniture you'll love this boot. The slave labor used to make this boot was wasted	0
I buy these wherever I can find them.  It's a bit of a tribute to my aunt, for her middle name, but wish I could find them more frequently. 	1
The quality was very poor, it was very wrinkled and to thin for a mens winter sweater. I send it back	0
The product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what I had ordered.  I really like it	1
on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio	1
"Not worth the price at all...
The bead work looks very cheap...
The color does not look the way its shown in the picture.
Decided to return it the moment I opened the box.."	0
it doesnt fit well. the joystick doesnt function right with it on. the buttons are difficult to use. the product was poorly mad	0
These shoes are so comfortable and cute! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, and I like their old-school Pony look	1
My son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp & he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play	0
I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn't see the item but was told it was very cute	1
I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age	0
Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs	0
These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had them.  The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time.  The fit is perfect and comfortable	1
I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai	1
The length of the jacket could be a little longer...bairly hits the belt	0

I love them and they are really hot! 
Thnx

"My  only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff
Otherwise Great Gym Pant"	1
I ordered these based on the picture---a high cut brief. These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them! Rip off!!! Zero stars	0
This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount.  Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though	1
I love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them.  I am the envy of the girls at work	1
I would not buy this sweater.  It is flimsy, and not very quality feeling.  The price was too good to be true	0
After one washing, the letters were all rolled up. I was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie. The quality of the graphic was horrible	0
The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.	1
"Good material and does the job that it promises!! All other brands claim to do the same thing but ""not all glitters are gold"" :"	1
great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting	1
slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed. construction was cheap, goose fill was light and overall flimsy. if you want to wear it twice, then thats what its worth	0
i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing	0
the shawl was beauiful and just the right color. an excellent value too.very good product fast shippin	1
Found the item to be poorly designed. Did not fit my checks or recorder. Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear	0
Arrived fast and in time for V-day! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival	1
I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY	1
"i tried these on and i'll never wear boxers again!
They are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight.
they are tight, but not too tight. I wear these to school
as well! I love them"	1
It's a very nice polo, very soft and nice to a casual date	1
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :-	1
"It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out.

I wear it cycling and golfing"	1
"I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i"	0
The wallet was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  He loved the wallet, the leather, the design, style, and sleek look of the Fossil wallet. It was a great purchase and a good value	1
It was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back. But the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal Van Heusen shirts	0
this is a form fitting, but not to snug nightshirt. gives freedom of movement, yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material. deffinitly will order more of thes	1
I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.	1
Great grip, cool rugged look, comfortable enough for regular winter use as well. Was about $80 when I got it though. Might not be the best option around for $130	1
i bought a green ipod scok, thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page, but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted.	0
Even though it works just fine like Ipod Ipod sock, it's quite disappointed that this is not a genuine one. It's acceptable thoug	0
Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order	1
Spectacular item.  Wears well on a fine woman.  My wife is short, and this item fit fine, especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall	1
Thank you for this Great Gift for a baby shower States away that you made helpful and she loves i	1
These go on real easy, and come off real easy.  They feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away.  I'm ordering more	1
I did not expect the Jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini. These should be renamed Jockey Show-Everything Bikini	0
The shorts were everything I wanted. The service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time. I bought him all the colours available	1
Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!	0
Returns and exchanges are very slow - process has taken a month so far	0
I own 2 pairs ...They are classy and go with everything,but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it	1
shirts are what I had expected and the service was grea	1
I am very pleased with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look great as well. 	1
This is cute, funny, and it's not uncomforable! I think it rocks! I love this movie...I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL???	0
This is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra I have even owned.  Have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now.  The fit is unbelievable	1
Paid for expedited delivery, and it showed up four days later then anticipated	0
This sandle is very comfortable and attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle	1
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking	1
I have purchased these beloved sport pants for years. The cut of these pants has been changed with this order. The quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now. I returned the item	0
Good short sleeve shirt, but I ordered a long sleeve	0
The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service.	1
Broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars.  Wouldn't recommend	0
See my review for the Desert Digital.  I own both the woodland and the desert BDU's	1
"Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate.
thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo"	1
This bra fits, is comfortable, and invisible under T-shirts. I hope they keep making it forever	1
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class	1
incorrect color was shown on the website.  it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase.	0
I love it. It is just what I wanted. Great deal and smooth transaction. Thanks	1
Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them	0
Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions.  It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot.	1
speedy delivery  product  as  stated   would buy from them agai	1
"This is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me, or most people I know.  36"" bust, 33"" waist and 41"" hip?  FAT FAT FAT!  What about us tall slim people"	0
This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!	1
I got this because I thought it was a good deal, but the clothes weren't very cute and weren't good quality.  I gave them all away, I don't recommend	0
I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful.  The Lalita is very uncomfortable.  They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub.  I was truly disappointed	0
These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either	1
I bought 2 of these least year. First the ID info came off enroute, then the green rollup part came off coming back. Will not purchase again	0
"These socks are wonderful.  Just the right weight, very comfortable and warm.
Don't fade after washing, etc. etc.   I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more"	1
This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric!  There is no shape to the gown...AWFUL	0
The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price.  Very satisfied	1
I where these shoes all the time. They are really comfortable to run in	1
One shoe did not fit properly--also didn't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking	0
I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs. Not only I did grow up wearing their brand, but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs. If somethings not broke why fix it	1
I guess you get what you pay for. the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item. It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat's litter box than a magical device	0
I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. Thanks	1
I received wrong item, but there was no service after that	0
This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company. 	1
I ordered a small, it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow	0
Love Hush Puppies.  They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable	1
My mouth dropped when i received this item.  the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use.  For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets	0
The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job 	1
The bra came well packed, speedily and it is very like the picture and description.  The fit is good	0
Great overall shirt.  Good quality, wears well.  Wear it proudly	1
This sweater fits perfect - exactly what I was looking for and I coudn't go wrong with this fabulous price.  My husband liked it as well	1
"The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
     1.  I thought ""sheer"" meant sheer.
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)"	0
I want to help overseas products, but this advertises itself as cashmere. IT ITCHES MY NECK! Cashmere does not itch. Color was not represented appropriately	0
Good socks. , nice material. but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it. They are knee high and stay up, provide good warmth in the cold weather	0
Ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities. I was still cold. Just a regular average socks, easy to wash and dry so great for travelling, nothing more	0
This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic	0
Soo comfortable and soo warm.  The only thing that sucks about them is that they aren't waterproof	1
"I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i"	0
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too	1
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful	1
and I am very pleased with them.  They are very comfortable!!  My sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	1
"Extremely poor quality cloth. Very bad color. It looks used .
Never ever buy any items from this vendo"	0
This is my husband's favorite shirt because it's light and comfortable. It is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat	1
These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn.  They are worth every penny, in my opinion.  They are designed for a man, plus they seem to not gather moisture, as some fabrics do	1
I bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use, a pocket ripped so we will be returning it	0
It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way	1
Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand	0
"The sleeves on this fleece are very long.  I have a 34"" sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands.  Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece.  I returned mine"	0
I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these	0
At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0
The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off. 	0
"My ""tween"" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.
They are comfortable and stylish.
This is her 3rd pair.
I'm glad that I found them online.
They are both old-school and stylish"	0
"Looks great on the web, don't think many would buy it if they could examine it in-person.  

Shame, colors and style are excellent just let down in quality and fit"	0
The pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it. 	0
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy	1
This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one. 	0
I really liked the Black Tuxedo Outfit, my son wore it in a pageant and won, so I am very very happy about that. The tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him	1
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase	1
If your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you can't go wrong with the cami/panty combo. Its cute but sexy. Very nice	1
I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well	1
This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever.  I highly recommend it	1
More than pleased...excited.  The price was better than local stores; should have purchased several pairs.  Easy on the feet, wear well, and on and off at the airport	1
My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter.  They are perfect, washing easily, and retaining their size and color	1
Not as expected, too short,   nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks	0
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear	1
"I still got a pantyline with this---strange and frustrating----

On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank	0
Got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well	1
This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.  	1
Quality product, exactly what I wanted, but it runs large. I wear a half size, bought the size larger & now think I'll buy the smaller size	1
Very warm and comfortable for the price.  For any price, really.  Nice, looks good, feels comfy, keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least	1
Good bag, I thought it was a little bigger, but it worked out great	1
These gloves are very soft and seem to be made well, but they have a big flaw:  the fingers are too short.  Ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems	0
I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too	1
"These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.

"Hole in pocket, not completly sewn.
Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes.
Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve"	0
Very comfortable and feel. No one makes it like Under Armour	1
This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  =	1
   I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price	1
I never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status. This left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays ...I am out the money	0
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army	1

..all over the neighbourhood.  now we're getting divorced and it's all YOUR FAULT Male Power Sheer Bong Thong!  i hate you	0
The product arrives just as shown. Sturdy, attractive leather. Just the right size for small items. This is an A++ product	1
This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each?	0
I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them	1
I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money	0
My baby loves his new kicks!! They came quick and would recomend them to anyone	1
I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received	0
Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles	1
I never receive this ITEM, i want may money back or replace my order	0
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.	1
Very comfortable, but the straps keep coming loose. 	1
and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas	0
My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter.	1
Excellent product. Item arrived fast and exactly as described. Works like a charm. Haven't yet had TSA open the lock, but it does the job	1
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it	0
This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable.  The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material. 	0
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour	1
I bought these based on a previous review. After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart. Maybe the quality control person was out that day??? I returned them and got a full refund	0
Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot. 	0
Excellent quality for the price I paid.  Very happy with purchase. Arrived in a timely manner	1
I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.	0
"very cute but have a funky balance, wobly and on the verge
of falling over. not comftorable. poorly designe"	0
I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else	1
I  just love the color and the way it looked on me . IT  is a very very pretty jacket 	1

After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase, a leather bag tag is what i needed.  They stay on the suitcase and don't break	1
These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price	1
"I am solidly a size medium, but I was swimming in this jacket.  I think it is more of an XL.  I'd say the medium is for someone 5'10"" and 250lbs"	0
" This product is what I expected when I buy a Carhartt product.
 It's a quality item and worth the money I spent"	1
"There was no picture of this selection, so I guessed it was a ""ringer"" type t-shirt.  Instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching.  I never wore it, but gave it to Goodwill"	0
I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:	1
Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.	0
It's just what I wanted. I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel.	1
not as pretty as I hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit. DO not regret the purchas	1
This bag is much smaller then i was expecting. the zippers do not open/shut easily.  I was very disapointed	0
I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone	0
Well, since I will be using this soon, I believe it will be just perfect. Holds all the necessary items safely, so will let you know when I return from my trip	1
Material was not overly thick and designs were great! Look good on my daughter	1
I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale.  But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be.  In addition, the fabric is bad.  There are tores in all of the edges	0
This bra has an akward fit.  I had to return it.  A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret	0
I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower.  I've looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more.  These socks stay on my little boy's feet and are made very well	1
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old	1
"I love my Clarks and I can get such good prices through Amazon.  I have
bought two pairs of Clarks with Amazon and I plan on buying more in
the future.  Bett"	1
Cute designs but they shrink.  I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up. 	0
The product was as advertised and delivered on time	1
Need to use a belt definitively. Does not look like the picture. If you do not use a belt, you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top. 	0
The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!	1
These are so pleasing on the eye. What can I say besides the fact that these jeans fit great, look great, and attract alot of attention. Buy them!!	1
This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!!	0
There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they're good for mountian hikers. The keep your feet warm and dry	1
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)	0
My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer.	1
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended	0
I love these shoes. I bought 3 colors and they are great! They are very stylish AND comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe	1
After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe	0
"Sharp set of shoes.  Comfortable, too, and they fit well.

But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella's Coach - while the mice were still mice.  It took FOREVER to arrive, so be warned"	1
Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic	1
I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly	1
Horrible. Must go through hell to return it too, they won't give you back the shipping to send it to you, just the cost of the item. Do not buy. Do not recommend	0
quick shipping and a great product, I am looking forward to using it VERY soon	1
This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole	0
It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans!	1
My wife used this to get a better fit into her wedding gown.  In retrospect, she wonders if it would've worked even better if she had worn a traditional strapless bra over the Shape and Size bra	1
The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them	0
This was a great purchase, and I love keen shoes.  My only complaint is sweaty feet when it's hot, and the shoes don't dry out very quickly	1
My girlfriend thinks they're sexy and they're solid underwear.  No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs.  If you're a briefs guys (I switch around), these are the way to go	1
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff	1
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this	0
"This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.
great buy good pric"	1
These socks were thin, large, and horrible.  They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently.  Absolutely worthless	0
I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator. Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder.	0
The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.	1
I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product	1
I wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe.  Should not happen at nearly $6 a pair and a logo of GOLD TOE	0

"this listing isen't correct.
item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt, not a t-shirt"	0
I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you	0
My husband, the Star Wars fanatic, loves them!  Very comfy	1
This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.  I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper. 	0
Great item!  Have already used several times and is exactly as is described	1
This is a really soft, and very comfortable pillow.  It is priced great, a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows.  I am very satisfied	1
This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through	0
I ordered this boot in a size 7, Pewter.  Very cute boot and fits perfectly.  Very comfortable fit and feel.  Everyone who saw them wanted to know where I got them!  Simply darling boot	1
I have really enjoyed my sunglasses.  Quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item.  Would buy from again	1

Lawhote"	1
Why? I do not know. But be more carefully anbout it	0
I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They're well made and super comfortable. He liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color. Highly recommended	1
Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes	0
I bought these for my son, and he says they are really comfortable; he wears them when he plays basketball--lots of support and no blisters.  I'll most likely buy another pair for him..	1
I love this bra!  It is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said, adds a whole cup size!  Cheaper than Victoria's Secret and well made	1
Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit	0
Not very good pictures or description.Wallet was smaller than I expected.Quality was OK,not competitively priced	0
I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on	1
I can't say much for the shoes, but Amazon goofed up on this one.  They shipped out an empty box.  Luckily UPS caught it and sent notice to Amazon for me. 	0
Seller will not honor prices listed...then if you leave seller negative feedaback..AMAZON WILL REMOVE IT!!! Do not trust seller ratings..they are false!!!!	0
Great product with speedy delivery. The shoes arrived before I expected and were exactly what I wanted. Thank you!	1
The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.	1
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie	1
These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.	0
I love this umbrella. It's just the right size and works perfectly. It's so pretty that I don't want to get it wet!!	1
It won't help you get dry, it's more of a robe to hang out. I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund	0
These were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities. He thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers.  They are a great value	1
These bras do not hold up very well. I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away - six months later	0
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service	1
These broke within the first 3 days of use. 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
"The picture of the shoes was deceiving.  Did not want ankle strap.  You could not
go by the picture.  Which is how you do online shopping. Returned the shoes."	0
These shoes are great!  My daughter tried to talk me into giving them to her.  Quick Delivery.  Good Quality	1
Great delivery & of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b/c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up !	1
The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough	0
These boots look very nice, but unfortunately, it is way too narrow (and I have narrow feet).  My whole foot felt squashed.  Back to Amazon it goes	0
This shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot	0
This bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike.  The cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes, but not so large everything gets lost inside	1
"I wear a lot of Rockport shoes. Almost exclusively. I was very disappointed in these shoes. They are the same ""size"" as all of the other Rockports I have, yet they are too small"	0
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.	1
Swimsuit very cute - size as stated (16 = 20/22)  Bra did not have enough support for me so I wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well.  I love it	1
i love these shoes, they are totally cute. the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper. they aren't as soft as i thought they would be, but i great buy none the less. 	1
I just love different and odd things. I love to give people gifts that no one else have.Thanks	1
I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST	1
Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.  If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect.	0
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.	1
Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price	1
Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed	0
This is the only shoe I wear for High Impact Jazzercise classes four+ times per week.  I have a wide, flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly.  And with boot cut jazz pants, they look great! 	1

I always wear them to my mom's office"	1
I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra.  This bra fits horribly.  Do not buy if you are DD/E cup!  This bra is uncomfortable and doesn't hold your goods properly	0
These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy	1
These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.	1
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove	0
Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .Do reccomend	1
"it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces. 
look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good"	0
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets	1
I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!?	0
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone	1
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!	1
These were not as expected, there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels, there was just an open hole. He has problems using these too!	0
This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again	0
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it	1
These are hot, Hot, HOT!  Will be buying them in other colors.  My guy went NUTS	1
i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped	0
  The product is in good condition when it was shipped. The quality is good. Thank you.	1
i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips!	0
I bought these for my husband.  He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm.  He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself !	1
The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad	0
.....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that	1
These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans	0
"This item arrived on time and the quality was great. This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for ""baby"" - it's just how I expected it would be"	1
You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them. 	0
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!	1
I agree.  Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy	0
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it	1
This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back	0
"This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch. 
Not a summer coat too heavy!!! The next model needs to have pit zips!"	1
I have several jackets. They are well made, warm and I wouldn't wear any other. Long lasting and look good with anything	1
I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game	0
This is really a great item, very comfortable.  I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose.  Great for the intended purpose though	1

The slippers are great; comfortable and good quality. Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago. Buying them online was so convenient	1
I absolutely love this suit, my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down	1
Very comfortable and sexy. Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace	1
just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them. 	0
"This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a ""traditional"" Speedo suit"	1
I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32. The bathing suit was too tight. I'll get in on size 34 next time	1
Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18.  The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother	0
A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified	1
Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality	0
These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely. Do not buy them.	0

The scarf itched my neck, smelled funny and was not the color of ivory. It was beige. It is not cashmere. It would not itch if it were cashmere	0
I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.  On the picture it looks more blue than purple	0
THESE ARE THE SOFTEST - MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS!   YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER	1
These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	0
Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me	0
These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk	0
she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all	0
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon	1
I would not buy this product again.  It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end	0
awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet	1
The item is not my concern; I still have not even received it	0
VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle	0
These socks are just what I was looking for, a thin cotton blend to wear running.  No bunching and they breath very well.  The price and timliness of the order was also great	1
I ORDERED A LARGE AND ASSUMED IT WAS ADULT SIZE...THIS LARGE WAS LIKE A GIRLS SIZE LARGE....VERY SMALL SIZING  I RETURNED THE SWEATER..	0

Great service.  The shoes were just what I wanted.  I highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable	1
Sorry, there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months...runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer.  Can be seen straight through	0
Plugged into Ipod and guess what! Audio and video came out the other end! A little spendy but what can ya do	1
The socks were nice but cost too much .  Price a little unreasonable	1
Calvin Klein provides a fashionable, comfortable underwear. Tight but not too tight, it holds you in place, while not constricting you to a tight position. Excellent, but don't buy them too little	1
.............they sent me the wrong size...and didn't leave clear returning guidelines. You are better off getting something cheaper, because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck	0
This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide.  They run small.  They look nicer in the picture than they actually are	0
This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now	0
I regained my sanity after getting these. Sooooo much nicer than disposables	1
I did not like this product at all. It is very hard to use and  too small	0
I received the earmuffs I ordered 3 days after I placed the order	1
The earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter	1
Our son was very pleased to get a leather jacket for Christmas. The proof is in the wearing!  He's been wearing it ever since.  Thanks for the great transaction! 	1
I love these boots! I got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect. I can fit pants in them or over them and I have not had a problem yet	1
HESITANTLY, I ORDERED MY FIRST PAIR OF FOLK READERS; NOW I'M BACK FOR A SECOND PAIR. THEY'RE COMFORTABLE, UNIQUE, WELL-CRAFTED AND THE COMPANY OFFERS EXCELLENT SERVICE - A WINNER	1
"This is a one of a kind handbag.  Great on a night out or just for kicks!  Unbeatable price for such a genuine item.

Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.	0
I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality. 	1
I've been looking for black sport socks for a long time!  Finally, a black comfortable, cushy sport sock of medium thickness.  I'm completely satisfied	1
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again	1
I am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . Very Pleased	1
I bought this for my daughter.  She is into pink and camo???   Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it.  What more is there to say	1
This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms	0
"I love the sweatshirt! It came exactly as pictured and in time for me to 
wear it for the Super Bowl"	1
The item was not as pictured.  It is funky and of poor quality.  The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this	0
"For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.
Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item.  I will never shop Amazon or any online store"	0
The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars	0
I have done a review on these socks already, which has not appeared.  They are not a good buy	0
Tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable. The stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix. GOOD DEAL	1
The zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job, the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly, easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain	1
I like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out. I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small. 34B fits in other brands so I know it's not because I've got bigger	0
i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week	1
if you have a 60 gig iPod, this isn't 4 u... it is way too tight, limits access to the click reel, and completly blocks access to the hold butto	0
I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used.	0
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to	1
I bought my wife the set and she loves it, everything from Figleaves has beed great	1
I love these running shoes.  They have a great look and they feel great, too. They fit my feet perfectly	1
Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended	0
I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised	1
I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time	0
"HAD TO SEND BACK THE FIRST PAIR BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIGGER SIZE. RECEIVED THE SECOND PAIR AND CREDIT FOR THE FIRST PAIR PROMPTLY. THIS PAIR IS JUST RIGHT!!! WILL DEFINATELY
ORDER AGAIN. THANKS"	1
Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing	0
No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured	1
I bought the wrong size, the bra was too big, but the straps dug into my shoulders -- that's what wasn't soft...customer service returns was great though. (Essentials.com via Amazon	0
This jacket is well-made, stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks. Great addition to a professional wardrobe	1
I bought these boots for my husbamd. He only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down. I will never purchase them again....	0
These are nice sweatshirts.  Good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a Champion brand.  It is oversized so order your normal size and don't count on much shrinkage	1
I ordered this item on September 10, 2006.  As of January 12, 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice.  One star is one star too many	0
This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!!	0
This is a great item to have if you are loosing weight.  You can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones	1
Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly	1
This is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape don't buy since that is what is showing the most. I think it would rate a 5 if it wasn't lined like previous speedos	1
These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though	0
i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account. the item was not available and they said i would be credited. still waiting!	0
This is the most comfortable sports shoe that I have worn and I own just about every brand made	1
This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order. I ordered a size 9, but wasn't able to wear them. I gave them to my little brother who's a size 7, they fit him perfectly	0
I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes.	1
I love the Garrick sandal. It was exactly what I expected as seen in the stores. Delivery, and service was excellent	1
Does the job as described.  Recommend this brand.  DOwnst fall apart or rip after a couple of wears	1
I have Goddess bras, and it seems that each style has it's own sizing.  The love at first sight bra fits wonderfully, while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be	0
 This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.	0
This is my favorite for lap swims.  Reasonable modesty, but not baggy.  You'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage.  If you are not looking for a tan, get this one!	1
Item send was not new. Obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use. Also a rip in the design	0
The shoes are awesome...my daughter LOVES them! Business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction	1
All boot is made with mademan materials. Then they are not as comfortable as I want. With the same amount you can find a better option	0
Classic wedding tuxedo. Excellent fabric and cut. The tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval.	1
Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size.   I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size.	1
I purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top I've worn to date. Since then I have purchased 4 more	1
"Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!!
It's just waste of mone"	0
I would definitely recommend getting a size AND width larger, as these fit very snuggly	0
Like I said, they didn't fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive. :	0
Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in	0
"Poor quality, belts do not fit correctly, can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy.
Don't trust Skinny Dip Swimwear"	0
I did realize that these shoes squeaked, but I didn't anticipate how loudly that squeak would be! I doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making- I know I couldn't	0
Like all the Haynes T-shirts except the 50/50, these bunch at the back of the neck. Try another brand	0
"I have the gown too and ordered the PJ's from the direct website.
They are the same great quality and the bottoms are so cute, I wear them all the time out of the house"	1
See title. these shoes are simply the best pair of foot protectors ive ever owned. so comfortable,  waterproof and just sweet-looking. i feel like a ninja every time i wear them	1
The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good.	0
"Mom was looking for a similar item, from ""Bass"".  I told her this brand was very reliable.  She can put them down"	1
this item was a great buy,fast delivery and was given as a gift...thank	1
"Shirt really made a ""hit"".   Arrived shortly after placing order"	1
I got my Adidas Adissage WHT/PNK sandals in record time. I was able to take them on my trip with me as intended. Also, the price was the best that I had seen on the internet.	1
"really nothing to say about this product...fast shipping, good deal.
i like the style and the color. not too loud"	1
Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on. 	0
I've been wearing this bra for years.  It just can't be matched for comfortable fit, no wires, no seams. Whatever your shape you can &quot;shake yourself&quot; into it	1
these boots are a great alternative to the military style combat boot. and the cost is less then when i purchased similar style boots when on active dut	1
This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctl	0
 This was exactly what my husband had admired in Macy's.  I paid $25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband's knowledge.  He is thrilled with the jacket	1
A good product and a good fit.  Wish the logo had been a little bigger	0
The Tiffany's version is super expensive. These are clean and simple. They get the job done	1
My wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and didn't think such a thing existed. Last week she wore this pair to a re-enactment and received many favorable comments. Highly recommende	1
looks very nice, material is not bad..just a little big from my original siz	1
no lace collar as advertised. cheap, nylon-like fabric. not worth the price	0
"i liked the book it was good but not as i expected, i needed more explanation before buying the book, like how the book will look like from the inside , 
anyhow in general its good 
Thank you Amazo"	1
With the sale and promotional rate applied. This is a great shoe	1
I am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been USmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday, March 28	0
I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet. I got the black and white, and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts	1
do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal	0
My son loves the shoes.  They are comfortable and very stylish.  They do not show dirt like other shoes.  They look to be made well and designed very nice too	1
I am tired of companies making money off of fakes.  The U.S. Government did not buy their field jackets from China.  These M65 O.D. Green Field Jackets are not real--They are a mid-grade reproductions	0
"The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.
I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.
The shoes are still too small."	0
 I love the shoes, very comfortable and i can wear them with just about anything	1
These sandals are very nice and the price that I paid was a very  good price	1
Great looking on my feet, extremely comfortable and the price for a suede sandal like this is phenomenal!  I'm going to order more. 	1
These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small!  I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear	0
I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance, and it arrived too late for me to wear it.  It's still in the package in my closet.  Maybe next year..	0
Color and image are delightful. I do wish I had gone up a size as I like to wear it with a long sleeved t-shirt underneath	1
I love these shoes! Tsubo is notoriously comfortable and these are amazing! They aren't the prettiest shoes in the world, but I can spend 12 hours on my feet in them and my feet are happy	1
These fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great.  Shoes at Amazon.com are one of my favorite on-line purchases, great prices	1
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone	1
This shoes are very lovely, classy and comfortable. I'm thinking of getting them in another colour	1
Exactly as advertised. If you're a Naruto nut, or like wristbands, I'd advise buying this	1
Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT!	0
Warm and soft. I have used this brand for years and they have never caused skin problems. This brand is warmer then those without the fuzzy inside	1
I had bought a bra of this model at a discount store, just got lucky.  It quickly became my favorite, and I was glad to find it at Amazon. 	1
My favorite underwear right now, the pima cotton is very soft.  If you want an alternative to boxer briefs, these are great. If you are kinda between sizes, round up	1
I bought these for a bridal shower gift. They say one size fits all but they where like an XXXSmall. They torn right when they where tried on. VERY POOR QUALITY!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE	0
I like this fragance and the shipment was awsome,I didn't know what they supose to be here and when i check de tracking it was like delivered and I check my mail and it was there!AWSOME AWSOME AWSOM	1
The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater.  Material is good for both the t-shirt and hoodie.  For the quality and price, can't beat it anywhere	1
The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief	0
The jacket itself its well made. BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture..	0
Sexy and well made. I am a size 12, but I bought the queen size and it fit great	1
The glasses were in excellent condition, they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me.  This was an excellent seller	1
"Looks nothing like the image shown. 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee, let alone over it (and she isn't tall 5'5""). Keep looking...."	0
trans. was great. love the shirt!! I know it's a lot for a t-shirt, but I had to have it!!	1
Not only are these shoes great looking on...they are extremely comfortable.  I went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors	1
Men here is a tip.  If you want to please your lady, use a sexy thong instead.  We love how a man looks in a thong	0
These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had straight out of the box.  They look good and feel even better.  Highly recommended!!!	1
These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters	0
THis is a great additional purchase to the Princess costumes.  Just know for little fingers (children) they are hard to put on - requires parental assistance	1
I prefer the bibsters.  The quality on the toss away bibs is not as good - the material is quite thin, the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed	0
"Rubber boots don't have to look like booring rubber boots. I ordered Women's Tan ""Beach Holiday"" boots for my daughter as a Christmas present. They arrived in time for Christmas and she loves them"	1
I got this for my newborn son and it's so big- it fits my husband.  I wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat!!	0
